Worryingly, the number of children in need of assistance to access education has risen year on year, reaching 4.7 million by the end of 2018.3 The UN reports annually on the six grave violations4 of children’s rights in Yemen, which have been committed by a number of parties to the conflict, including the Saudi-led coalition, the Houthis and other armed groups. One of these violations is attacks on schools.</p> <p>Reports of attacks on schools have risen dramatically since 2015, and UN assessments confirm over 2,000 schools are not fit for purpose due to physical damage caused by the conflict as well as the presence of armed groups.5 The UN has identified 95 attacks on schools between 2015 and 2017 6,7,8 which meet the evidence requirement to be classified as a grave violation. Three quarters of these have been carried out by the Saudi-led coalition.</p> <p>Where schools remain safe and undamaged, their operation is hampered by insufficient teachers, due to non-payment of salaries, and inadequate basic resources, including drinking water and latrines. War Child research, carried out in December 2018 across ten districts in Yemen, also highlighted that families are often concerned for the safety of children at, and on their way to schools. This often leads to parents keeping children at home. Even when at school, it is difficult for children to learn as they struggle to deal with the psychological impact of living through war and the effects of hunger and malnourishment.</p> <p>These factors are having a disproportionate impact on girls’ access to education during the conflict, with the UN reporting that 36% of girls are currently out of school compared to 24% of boys.12 In many cases, families have de-prioritised girls’ education as a reaction to economic hardship and greater fear for their safety. Child marriage figures have undergone a threefold increase between 2017 and 201</p> <p>Setbacks in children’s education not only have consequences for the lives of individuals but also for the development and prosperity of the country. Damage to the education sector now will have longlasting consequences, impacting the education of future generations.</p> <p>Despite the urgency of need, UN Yemen humanitarian response plans have remained underfunded year on year, with the education cluster securing less than half (43%) of appeal amounts requested between 2011 and 2018.</p> <p>To ensure access to education, not only does funding need to increase, but it also requires parties to the conflict to uphold the legal and political obligations that exist on states to protect children’s rights. Despite such obligations, attacks on schools in Yemen have continued unabated by many armed parties to the conflict and especially by the two main sides, the Houthi and Saudi-led coalition forces.</p> <p>The fact that education is under attack in Yemen is symptomatic of a wider pattern of flagrant disregard for international law throughout the conflict.</p> <p>Since 2015, 87 states have endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration16, a political commitment to protect children, teachers, schools and universities from attack and take measures to stop the military use of education facilities during conflict. The UK and France have made this commitment, but despite the clear evidence of attacks on schools by the Saudi-led coalition, they have continued to provide the coalition with political backing and military support through arms sales.</p> <p>These inconsistencies pose a threat to attempts to uphold the international rules-based system. Calling out violations of international law ring hollow, in this conflict and across the world, when governments including the UK, continue to profit from the Saudi-led coalition.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/sites/default/files/link-files/War_Child_UK_Yemen_Report_Being_Kept_Behind_FINAL.pdf">https://www.warchild.org.uk/sites/default/files/link-files/War_Child_UK_Yemen_Report_Being_Kept_Behind_FINAL.pdf</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p> <p><strong>Ramadan in “the graveyard for the living”</strong></p> <p>Seven women share their experiences of extreme hardship during Ramadan in war-torn Yemen</p> <p>As the stories of these women show, Ramadan in Yemen is harder than it has ever been. As the conflict drags on, more than 20 million people won’t be enjoying festive meals or Ramadan favourites — in fact, they will hardly have enough food to survive. This makes it all the more important for the World Food Programme (WFP) — the largest humanitarian agency operating in the country, covering each month the most basic food needs of more than 10 million people — to be granted the sustained funding and unrestricted country-wide access to reach all Yemenis in need.</p> <p>“We fast every day of the year now.” — Afrah</p> <p>Afrah’s name means joy, but the holy month of Ramadan has been a struggle for this mother-of-four.</p> <p>“Ramadan was better before the war. Iftar consisted of rice, chicken and yogurt, now my children eat only bread and water,” says Afrah Hassan, 34.</p> <p>Before Ramadan began, Afrah collected as much rubbish as she could from the streets — plastic, paper, scrap wood, twigs. This is the fuel she uses in her little makeshift oven to bake bread. Afrah’s family hasn’t had cooking gas for more than six months. It takes two hours for the oven to heat, so she needs a big supply of materials to burn. She knows that burning plastic is bad for her and her children’s health, but she doesn’t have a choice.</p> <p>“Today is the first day of Ramadan, I have only a little flour and one egg to feed my family. I will prepare the bread for my children and boil the egg. I will cut the bread and egg into small pieces. That’s the only meal we have,” Afrah says.</p> <p>There are severe shortages of cooking gas in the local market and what is available is very expensive; nearly double what it cost before the conflict. The food she receives from WFP she says she often shares with other women, like her neighbour Hossn.</p> <p>“We fast every day of the year now. There is no difference between the month of Ramadan and other months,” she adds. “In Yemen we can no longer feel any occasions; nothing really feels like what it used to, not Ramadan, not Eid.”</p> <p>“The two most terrible things in my life over the last four years are the hunger and the sounds of the explosions.” — Hanan Mohamed Ahmed, 17</p> <p>Hanan was just 13 when the war began. Her home was destroyed by the first airstrikes to hit Sana’a on 26 March 2015. Her family of six have lived in a single rented room ever since.</p> <p>“The two most terrible things in my life over the last four years are the hunger and the sounds of the explosions,” says Hanan.</p> <p>She was forced to leave school two years ago because her family could no longer afford the fees. Now she is responsible for cooking all the meals for her family.</p> <p>“Before, my country was better, there was no war, no missiles, no fear, and prices were cheaper,” says the seventeen-year-old.</p> <p>“I wish that Ramadan had come at a time we had lots of flour, rice and gas. But Ramadan came while the war is still going on and the hunger continues.</p> <p>“For me all I wish as a Yemeni girl is that I can live in peace. That we get the cooking gas back to my country. That the war ends. That the fear leaves our country and we live in peace.” (with photos)</p> <p><span><a href="https://insight.wfp.org/ramadan-in-the-graveyard-for-the-living-51a1716113ce">https://insight.wfp.org/ramadan-in-the-graveyard-for-the-living-51a1716113ce</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>YEMENI WAR AND SHIFT OF POWER: A REFLECTION ON THE HISTORY OF SOUTHERN ISSUE AND POSSIBLE SCENARIOS IN SOUTH</strong></p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>This paper sheds some light on the Southern Issue with reference to 2015 war in Yemen and shift of power. It has briefly surveyed the history of Southern Issue and the conflict relating to this issue, passing by 2015 war and shift of power. It has presented the history of this period impartially and neutrally and then reflected on the possible political scenarios in South Yemen in the light of the present war. It concluded with some recommendations that may help the concerned politicians involved in the Yemeni crisis to bring peace and stability to Southern Yemen particularly and Yemen generally.</p>  <ol><li><span> Introduction</span></li> </ol><p>In the South, Southern Resistance Forces, led by General Aidroos AL-Zubaidi, are considered as the main player on the ground. These military forces were formed during the last two decades and most of them during the last 2015 war as they gained some financial and logistic military support from the Arab coalition and Hadi’s legitimacy during their war against Huthi – Saleh’ ally in 2015. Though these forces are fighting against Huthi – Saleh and give support to Arab coalition and Hadi’s legitimacy in their war out of the Southern borders, they don’t consider themselves a part of Hadi’s legitimacy and don’t believe in Hadi’s political view to have Yemen of six regions. They consider themselves as the future military and security forces of the South. Before going on to explain more details, it will be better to have a look of the short back history of the failed Yemeni unification.</p> <p><span>Southern Issue</span></p> <p>Southern issue refers to southern people’s political and economic suffering under the Northern regime. It began after taking over the South in 1994, deploying Northern military forces in its cities and mountains, excluding southern diplomats and army generals and soldiers from their works, distributing Southern land and wealth among northern leaders…etc. Such a situation created a kind of unfairness against the Southern people and made them feeling that they were citizens of a second degree. Most of the Southerner could not express the discontent of the situation for some time due to the huge Yemeni military forces surrounding them but such a suffering was getting worse more and more and Southerners began their peaceful revolution by forming ‘Military Pensioners’ Association’ and then ‘Southern movement’ in 2007 through which they demanded for equality with the northerner and returning to their work. This movement began as demanding for equality, financial rights, justice in distributing wealth and returning what has been robbed, which then developed into demanding for their political rights and restoration of their colonized state.</p> <p><span>The Rise of Southern Transitional Council (STC) as a Political Representative for Southerners</span></p> <p>Though the general goal of STC is totally different from Hadi's government’s. The temporary alliance between STC and its resistance with Hadi's exiled government is only to emerge the Southern issue that was deliberately neglected to the surface and to be clearly seen in front of the neighbors and the world. It is worth mentioning that STC members are doing their best in building bridges of relationships on the locally, regionally and internationally sphere. In this respect, in logical activation, STC is systematically formed its branches in all the southern governorates and districts and continued in preparing security and military forces with the assistance of Arab coalition, especially UAE.</p> <p><span>Southern Issue and the Possible Scenarios in the South</span></p> <p>Based on researchers’ observations of the situation in Southern Yemen and in Yemen generally, their meetings and discussions with some academicians and politicians and their reading and listening to speeches of political leaders and those specialists in Yemeni situation, they have summed up four possible scenarios that may take place in the South in the future. One scenario could be peaceful and satisfy the Southern will while the other three may complicate the situation and open new stages of war as they don’t pay attention to the southern issue and to the power change that took place in the South. As being optimistic of peaceful future, we will begin by the peaceful scenario, and then we will move to other options:</p> <p><span>Conclusion and Recommendations</span></p> <p>Southern Issue has appeared after the invasion of South in 1994 and controlling it by force, then applying compulsory exile and retirement to Southern military, diplomatic and political leaders as well as soldiers. The Yemeni merging unity converted into a forced union with different unfair policies that made Southerners feel that they are citizen of second degree. Such a situation created a lot of peaceful and violent conflict between the Southerners and the Yemeni government. Ignoring such unfair issues accelerates the situation in the South and led to more and more upset – by <em>Sabri Thabit Saleh Ahmed, Mohammed Nasher Saeed Nasser</em></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.oapub.org/soc/index.php/EJPSS/article/view/519">https://www.oapub.org/soc/index.php/EJPSS/article/view/519</a></span></p> <p>and full document <span><a href="https://www.oapub.org/soc/index.php/EJPSS/article/view/519/1098">https://www.oapub.org/soc/index.php/EJPSS/article/view/519/1098</a></span></p> <p>Comment: This is a very important document from the perspective of Southern Yemen.

My research on the Yemeni civil war suggests that these drone strikes can be partially explained by internal insecurities within the Houthi movement, as <span><a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/yemen/second-al-houthi-minister-defects-to-saudi-arabia-1.60358339">numerous Houthi officials</a></span> have defected to Saudi Arabia in recent months. By targeting Saudi oil facilities, the Houthis can increase their popular support in northern Yemen. Houthi drone strikes play into the popular desire for revenge against Saudi Arabia’s alleged theft of Yemen’s oil wealth, showcase the Houthis’ ability to counter Saudi bombardments, and counter Saudi depictions of the Houthis as a terrorist group that targets civilians. Houthi drone strikes against Saudi oil facilities are closely linked with the movement’s outreach efforts in Yemen, as they appeal to the popular narrative that Saudi Arabia and its allies seized oil resources from the Yemeni people. Given this rhetoric and the absence of an international show of support for the Houthis, it is unsurprising that the Houthis used coercion to demonstrate that they were taking action against Saudi Arabia for its seizure of Yemen’s oil.</p> <p>Houthi drone strikes against Saudi oil facilities are closely linked with the movement’s outreach efforts in Yemen, as they appeal to the popular narrative that Saudi Arabia and its allies seized oil resources from the Yemeni people.</p> <p>Given this rhetoric and the absence of an international show of support for the Houthis, it is unsurprising that the Houthis used coercion to demonstrate that they were taking action against Saudi Arabia for its seizure of Yemen’s oil.</p> <p>Houthi strikes on Saudi oil facilities also reveal how effective retaliation against perceived Saudi cease-fire violations is vital for the preservation of elite cohesion.</p> <p>Given this desire to dispel notions that the movement is weakening, Houthi drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities should be viewed as a direct retaliation for <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/yemen-houthis-withdraw-hodeidah-190510192224500.html">the refusal</a></span> of Hadi-aligned military forces to withdraw from Hodeida.</p> <p>As Saudi policymakers <span><a href="http://www.arabnews.com/node/1499936/saudi-arabia">frequently describe</a></span> the Houthis as a terrorist group, the Houthis are seeking to counter that narrative by launching drone strikes against economic and military targets in Saudi Arabia, instead of civilian areas.</p> <p>My interviews with prominent Yemeni analysts reveal that the Houthis’ reticence to target civilian areas in Saudi Arabia reflects their ambitions to preserve internal cohesion. Yemeni analyst Mareb al-Ward explained that the Houthis could fragment into “ideological factions” that favored indefinite confrontation with Saudi Arabia and “pragmatic factions” that sought to pursue a peace settlement in Yemen.</p> <p>Although Houthi drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities cannot be completely separated from the broader escalation of tensions in the Persian Gulf region, it is inaccurate to say that the Houthis are merely acting as Iran’s proxies when conducting these attacks.

To understand this seemingly paradoxical analysis, we have to ask two important questions: what goals did Mohammad Bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince and de facto ruler, set for his war in Yemen; and is it possible to lose the war despite winning the battle?</p> <p>In March this year the war entered its fourth year with very little to show in terms of achievements apart from the atrocities that the Saudis and their allies have committed in Yemen.</p> <p>Another sign that Riyadh is losing the war is the fact that the Houthi rebels have managed to fire missiles into Saudi Arabia</p> <p>The drone attacks might have been limited in scope but they are another sign that Saudi Arabia not only miscalculated its enemy’s capabilities but also failed to see how destructive the war could be for its own economy. </p> <p>Furthermore, wars can be lost simply because they drag on too long and become open-ended conflicts in which the original objectives are all but forgotten. In such cases, ending them is the wise thing to do. </p> <p>If Bin Salman did not achieve his victory in Yemen in four years he is unlikely to do so now that his enemy has become so battle-hardened. </p> <p>No matter what he does, Bin Salman has lost the war even if he still has the upper hand militarily. The economic cost of the conflict will outweigh any benefits the he might gain from the mess in which he has embroiled his country and allies in Yemen. Sadly though, unsuccessful leaders are usually very slow in accepting reality – by Mustafa Fetouri</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190530-how-saudi-arabia-is-losing-the-war-in-yemen/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190530-how-saudi-arabia-is-losing-the-war-in-yemen/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B K P)</span></p> <p>The Houthis March South</p> <p>The Houthis’ recent advances into southern and central Yemen reflect the country’s changing political landscape and the Yemeni government’s growing rift with the UAE.</p> <p>The Houthis’ southward push is a crucial breakthrough that exposed a <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/351127815011487/posts/1100380956752832">strategic flaw</a></span> in the Arab coalition’s plan in Yemen, particularly the growing tension between the Yemeni government and the UAE.</p> <p>On May 1, the Houthis captured al-Husha district in the western part of Dalea, which links central Yemen with the southwestern princes of Ibb and Taiz</p> <p>These military developments come amid important political developments</p> <p>Militarily, the Houthis have been winning on the battlefield since the beginning of 2019, benefitting from the truce imposed by the Stockholm Agreement in Hodeidah</p> <p>On March 8, after a two-month battle, the Houthis took control of the Hajour region in the Hajjah province in the northwestern corner of Yemen.</p> <p>This victory encouraged the Houthis to set their sights on central Yemen. They launched an assault on Dalea province, whose nine districts are divided between the Houthis and the internationally recognized government</p> <p>In contrast to the battle of Hajour, which aimed to secure the Houthi heartland, the battles in central Yemen (in Ibb, Dalea, and Bayda) seek to strengthen the Houthis’ influence and draw a border with the pro-Emirati STC. Both campaigns highlights Houthis’ efforts to strengthen their sway and increase the chances of establishing their de facto authority.</p> <p>However, the Houthi advance in the cities of central and southern Yemen is not only a result of own capability. Their advance has been aided by Riyadh and Abu Dhabi’s conflicting objectives and agendas, and their relationships with some of the groups backing the internationally recognized government. </p> <p>Notably, the coalition did not allow pro-government fighters to open up new fronts</p> <p>Similarly, coalition aircraft did not carry out airstrikes to disrupt the Houthis’ supply lines after their withdrawal from Hajour and Hodeidah fronts</p> <p>Escalating tensions between the Yemeni government and Abu Dhabi also played a significant role in the Houthis’ military victories. </p> <p>Ultimately, the Houthis’ victories reflect their political wrangling with Riyadh over the Saudi border issue, with Abu Dhabi about southern Yemen and the fate of the GPC in Sanaa, and Iran support. The Houthis’ have secured a rapid strategic victory in the central and southern regions that masks a more complicated geographical, sectarian, and tribal reality. These complexities raise the question of whether the Houthi victory will be sustainable. As long as power players such as Riyadh and Abu Dhabi continue to fuel the Yemeni conflict, clashes are likely to continue. – by Ateq Garallah</p> <p><span><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/79228">https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/79228</a></span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>Eid al-Fiter comes in days.

On Sunday, Saudi state media <span><a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=1928234#1928234">reported</a></span> it had successfully repelled the latest attack, which was attempted on an airport near the border with Yemen.</p> <p>The small drones used by the Houthis pose some significant problems for conventional militaries, according to <span><a href="https://www.cnas.org/people/nicholas-heras">Nicholas Heras</a></span>, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security. "They're difficult to stop because they're low profile," he says. "They don't give off a lot of radar signature, they fly relatively slowly." Moreover, using GPS, they can navigate through holes in air defenses.</p> <p>According to the U.S. government and several independent researchers, at least some of the drone technology being used by the Houthis seems to come from their main sponsor in the region — Iran.</p> <p>Iran started developing drones in the 1980s, says Gawdat Bahgat, a professor at the National Defense University. The work started in part because Iran was under various arms embargoes, and its air force was woefully out of date.</p> <p>"Within this context, drones are perfect," Bahgat says. They provide air power for "a fraction of the cost of fighter jets."</p> <p>So Iranian engineers began designing and building their own indigenous drones. </p> <p>Heras worries that the drones could also be used in a conflict with U.S. forces. Although the drones are far too primitive to do much direct damage, they could be used to distract. </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/726760128/in-yemen-conflict-some-see-a-new-age-of-drone-warfare">https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/726760128/in-yemen-conflict-some-see-a-new-age-of-drone-warfare</a></span></p> <p><span>and also </span><span><a href="https://intelnews.org/2019/05/30/01-2559/">https://intelnews.org/2019/05/30/01-2559/</a></span></p> <p>My comment: The Houthi-Iran drones story again.

First has to do with the Houthis’ unilateral pullout from three ports in Hodeidah province.</p> <p>Second, Griffiths has been referring to the Houthis as a “de-facto government”. In Hadi’s view, Griffiths is dealing with questions of legitimacy and treating the Houthis—who seized power in 2014 by military force—as if they are on equal terms with his government.</p> <p>Over the last few days, pro-government voices have been loudly slamming Griffiths’ performance.</p> <p>One side in Yemen’s civil war is unhappy with Griffiths’ performance, but the other feels the opposite. Indeed, the Houthis so far seem pleased with his role.</p> <p>Since the breakout of the war in Yemen in 2015, three UN envoys have been appointed to bring the conflict to a peaceful resolution. The first envoy was Jamal Benomar, who <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/yemen-envoy-jamal-benomar-resigns-150416011826230.html">left </a>his position in April 2015 at a time when fighting was spreading like wildfire. Ismael Ould Sheikh replaced him, but he stepped down in January of 2018, having made no progress towards peace. It remains to be seen if Griffiths will follow suit and bid farewell to Yemen and its conflict.</p> <p>Hadi’s letter may pave the way for Griffiths’ departure and the arrival of a new UN envoy to Yemen. The vicious circle of Yemen’s war will continue and the UN envoys will likely keep coming and going barring a major shift in the course of the war.</p> <p><span><a href="https://lobelog.com/does-yemen-need-a-new-un-envoy/">https://lobelog.com/does-yemen-need-a-new-un-envoy/</a></span></p> <p>My comment: Griffiths simply was right. Any mediator in any conflict must treat both sides on equal ternms – otherwise he would not be neutral, and he would fail.

Es sind ja nicht die Aktionäre, die selber morden. Das sind die „Werte“, die der Westen dem Rest der Welt vermitteln will: Geld kennt keine Moral und Geld verdienen ist immer gut. Gut, dass sich endlich Protest zeigt.

Anyone who understands the politics of the region knows that the Houthis are a direct extension of the mullah regime in Tehran. And the people who are paying the ultimate price for this Iranian aggression are the Yemeni people who, when they overthrew their government in September 2014, hoped to build a better future for their country. <br /> However, since then, they only experience bloodshed and war. What concerns the Houthis is not the interests of the Yemeni people, but their dark ideological project, which is no different from that of the Taliban project in Afghanistan. </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Voices-from-the-Arab-Press-THE-HOUTHIS-ARE-DIGGING-THEIR-OWN-GRAVE-591017">https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Voices-from-the-Arab-Press-THE-HOUTHIS-ARE-DIGGING-THEIR-OWN-GRAVE-591017</a></span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>Houthi militia mines kill Yemenis</p> <p>Houthi militia’s coup against the legitimate government in Yemen has triggered the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>You may have heard this statement many times, but did you understand the pain embodies in it?

What was new was a pattern of threat streams that extended from Yemen, so threats emanating from Yemen, threats in the Gulf and threats in Iraq,” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford said in his most detailed public remarks yet on the threats from Iran.</p> <p>“We also saw in the intelligence that perhaps there was a question about both the will and capability of the United States to respond. ... What I would argue was qualitatively different is we saw something that was more of a campaign than an individual threat,” he added.</p> <p>“And it was the geographic span and the perception that activity would try to be synchronized in time that caused us to look at that threat differently than 40 years, by the way, of malign activity by the Iranians. So malign activity and threats to our forces by the Iranians were not new, but a more widespread, almost campaign-like perspective for the Iranians was what we were dealing with.”</p> <p>Dunford was speaking at a wide-ranging discussion at the Brookings Institution on national security challenges facing the United States.</p> <p><span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/445959-top-general-recent-iran-threats-were-different-because-they-were-more-of-a">https://thehill.com/policy/defense/445959-top-general-recent-iran-threats-were-different-because-they-were-more-of-a</a></span></p> <p>and also: <span><a href="https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2019/05/top-us-officer-irans-threats-look-campaign/157341/">https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2019/05/top-us-officer-irans-threats-look-campaign/157341/</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/05/29/there-are-real-reasons-to-be-wary-of-iran-joint-chiefs-chairman-says/">https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/05/29/there-are-real-reasons-to-be-wary-of-iran-joint-chiefs-chairman-says/</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/05/29/dunford-sheds-light-threats-prompted-deployment-troops-iran.html">https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/05/29/dunford-sheds-light-threats-prompted-deployment-troops-iran.html</a></span></p> <p>My comment: And more propaganda bullshit.

That year, there were roughly 20,000 U.S. troops in South Vietnam. For years later, more than 500,000 GIs were in country.</p> <p>But the communists didn't have to win on the battlefield. They just had to outlast the United States, which they did – just like the Taliban have been able to do.</p> <p>The Forever Wars have reminded us of the Vietnam-era lesson that decisions about when the United States should go to war, how many troops should be sent to the fight, and what would constitute victory are vexingly complicated. When U.S. civilian and military leaders have no answers, their response is to muddle along in the hopes that a magical "political solution" will save the day – such as the communists and Taliban renouncing violence and joining a pluralistic, democratic government.</p> <p>In other words, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan all show that you can't improvise your way to victory.</p> <p>With Iran, top U.S. civilian leaders appear to be incrementally escalating the military's footprint in the Middle East. The problem is the Iranians can react by moving their forces in the region too. Then we react to their reaction. Then they counter our reaction and so forth. (This is how a nuclear reaction starts. It ends with a mushroom cloud.)</p> <p>It should be remembered that Vietnam was a war that President Lyndon Johnson did not want to fight. When he announced he was sending 50,000 more troops to Vietnam in 1965, Johnson framed his decision in terms of responding to a request from the U.S. military commander Army Gen. William Westmoreland for more forces in response to increasing communist attacks. – by Jeff Schogol</p> <p><span><a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/pentagon-iran-vietnam">https://taskandpurpose.com/pentagon-iran-vietnam</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Trump’s Decision to Arm the Saudis Against Iran Will End in Disaster</strong></p> <p>He's circumventing Congress and risking a war that most people on both sides don't want</p> <p>Developments in the Persian Gulf are heating up, and they are heating up fast.</p> <p>It’s obvious what this situation calls for: a direct line of communication between Washington and Tehran with the express purpose of calming the waters and preventing a conflagration. And yet the Trump administration seems to be gunning for the opposite—more bellicose threats, more military assets, and more sanctions.</p> <p>More weapons sales are also evidently part of the picture</p> <p>The provision, meant to be used in only the most dire emergencies, essentially eviscerates the congressional review process and steals power away from lawmakers who would ordinarily need to sign off on such a move.</p> <p>One envisions National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo whispering in Trump’s ear as he sits behind the big desk in the Oval that sending more weapons to Riyadh will deliver a message of resolve (a favorite Beltway buzzword) to the Iranians.</p> <p>But there aren’t enough adjectives in Webster’s dictionary to describe just how counterproductive, and, well, plain dumb this would be.</p> <p>First, such a decision would demonstrate total and complete contempt for a bipartisan majority in both houses of Congress </p> <p>The fact that Washington is selling these weapons to Riyadh rather than giving them away doesn’t make this ordeal any less pathetic. The president may not grasp the connection, but by opening up America’s arsenal to the Saudis, he is indirectly deepening America’s role as a combatant in a Saudi-Iranian rivalry that has torn the Middle East apart and done next to nothing to make the American people safer. At a time when the United States should be rebalancing its force posture and taking a hard look at where and how it allocates its limited military resources, Trump is bringing us deeper into a region of diminishing geopolitical importance.</p> <p>Finally, we need to evaluate this latest arms sale through the prism of today’s events. American-Iranian relations are in the pits. Direct communication between the two nations is likely nonexistent.</p> <p>Trump has talked rightly about war being the last thing he wants and has broached the idea of a bilateral negotiation with Tehran on issues of concern. Establishing more communication nodes with the Iranians is the correct approach.</p> <p>More weapons in the hands of the Saudis, however, sends Iran the opposite message—that the United States is only interested in talking if the topic is full surrender. And if Iran remains resistant to the idea, Washington will sell munitions to its adversaries until it‘s ready to sign off like the Japanese in 1945.</p> <p>It should go without saying that this is not something the Iranians will respond kindly to.

It sketches a pattern of rapid military build-ups in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE over the past 15 years, high levels of military spending as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) in all four countries, and growing military asymmetry in which Saudi Arabia and the UAE continue to build diverse and advanced military capabilities while Iran is unable to do the same. This raises concerns about the potential effects of these developments on the volatile security situation in the Middle East, the military intentions of these four states and the role of the countries that supply them with arms. The fact sheet also highlights the absence of government transparency in military matters in these countries by discussing the lack of detailed official data on military expenditure.</p> <p>Iran</p> <p>Iran’s military spending in the period 1994–2018 peaked in 2006, after which it fell by 30 per cent between 2006 and 2014 (see figure 1).</p> <p>However, in 2018 military spending decreased again, by 9.5 per cent, to $13.2 billion, as the Iranian economy went into recession and inflation increased from 10 per cent in 2017 to 30 per cent in 2018. In 2018 military spending was 2.7 per cent of GDP, the 25th highest in the world.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia</p> <p>In 2018 Saudi Arabia’s military spending amounted to an estimated $67.6 billion. It was the third-largest military spender globally and by far the largest military spender in the Gulf region.</p> <p>Qatar</p> <p>Military expenditure by Qatar cannot be estimated for the years after 2010, when its military expenditure was $1.9 billion (current US dollars) or 1.5 per cent of GDP </p> <p>The United Arab Emirates</p> <p>The most recent available estimate of military spending by the UAE was $22.8 billion (current US dollars) in 2014 (see figure 1), or 5.6 per cent of GDP. In 2014 the UAE was the second- largest military spender in the Middle East and ranked 14th in the world. </p> <p>Military Expenditure Transparency</p> <p>SIPRI military expenditure data reflects the official data reported by national governments in official publications such as budget documents and reporting to international organizations. However, government transparency in military spending in Qatar and the UAE is almost non-existent and in Saudi Arabia is very limited. There are also doubts about the reliability of government reporting on military spending by Iran. The lack of military expenditure data is a symptom of the general lack of transparency and accountability on military matters in the Middle East.</p> <p>Iran: Within the Gulf region, Iran is the most transparent in its public reporting on military expenditure. The most comprehensive document is published annually in December by the Iranian Government. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia: The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Finance has published data on the total budget and actual spending of the ‘military sector’ and the ‘security and regional administration sector’ since December 2016.

Die Länder müssten mit "Entschiedenheit" Angriffen auf Ölfördereinrichtungen in der Region begegnen, sagte der saudiarabische Außenminister Ibrahim al-Assad am Mittwochabend.</p> <p>Al-Assaf rief die islamischen Staaten vor mehreren Treffen der Arabischen Liga, des Golfkooperationsrats sowie der Organisation für Islamische Zusammenarbeit (OIC) in Mekka auch auf, die "Einmischung" des Iran in ihre Angelegenheiten zurückzuweisen. "Teherans Unterstützung für die Huthi-Rebellen im Jemen ist der Beweis für die Einmischung des Iran in die Angelegenheiten anderer Nationen", sagte der Außenminister seinen Kollegen der OIC-Staaten.</p> <p><span><a href="https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/bolton-teheran-fast-sicher-angriff-schiffe-k%C3%BCste-emirate-071522417.html">https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/bolton-teheran-fast-sicher-angriff-schiffe-küste-emirate-071522417.html</a></span></p> <p><span>(* A B P)</span></p> <p><span>Saudiarabien will die Reihen gegen Iran schliessen</span></p> <p>Rechtzeitig gegen Ende des Ramadan versammelt Riad die Führer der arabischen und islamischen Staaten in Mekka. An mehreren Gipfeltreffen soll es vor allem darum gehen, eine einheitliche Front gegen Teheran zu schmieden.</p> <p>Als Hüter über die heiligen Stätten in Mekka und Medina beansprucht das saudische Königshaus auch die Führungsrolle in der islamischen Welt. Doch diese glaubwürdig zu behaupten, fiel Riad in jüngster Vergangenheit immer schwerer.</p> <p>Dazu berief Saudiarabien vor zwei Wochen für diesen Donnerstag je einen «Notfallgipfel» der Arabischen Liga und des Golfkooperationsrates in Mekka ein.</p> <p>Von grosser Symbolik sind zudem auch der Ort und der Zeitpunkt kurz vor dem Ende des Fastenmonats Ramadan. Das saudische Aussenministerium spricht von «den Gipfeln der Einheit und des Zusammenhalts». Ziel der Treffen sei es, über die «jüngsten Aggressionen und ihre Konsequenzen» in der Region zu diskutieren, sagte König Salman.</p> <p>Ob Riad in einem solchen Worst Case mit der arabisch-muslimischen Solidarität rechnen kann, scheint zumindest fraglich zu sein. Nach langem Zögern schickte der saudische König vor wenigen Tagen zwar auch eine Einladung zu den Gipfeltreffen an den Emir von Katar. Doch dieser lässt sich nun «lediglich» durch den Premierminister vertreten.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.nzz.ch/international/saudiarabien-will-die-reihen-gegen-iran-schliessen-ld.1485706">https://www.nzz.ch/international/saudiarabien-will-die-reihen-gegen-iran-schliessen-ld.1485706</a></span></p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p>Saudi-Arabien will Krieg mit Iran abwenden</p> <p>Seit mehreren Jahren führen Saudi Arabien und der Iran einen Stellvertreterkrieg im Jemen. Weitet sich der womöglich zur offenen Konfrontation aus? Das will zumindest Riad unbedingt verhindern, wie der saudische Außenminister sagt.</p> <p>Saudi-Arabien will nach eigenen Angaben trotz aller Rivalität keinen Krieg mit dem schiitischen Erzfeind Iran. "Ein Krieg wäre für alle in der Region schädlich, und wir wollen ihn um jeden Preis vermeiden", sagte der saudische Staatsminister für Auswärtiges, Adel al-Dschubair, in einem Interview mit der BBC. Die Region befinde sich in einem "heiklen Moment" ihrer Geschichte, erklärte er.

The choice of Mecca, the Islamic Holy City, adds an important religious dimension, one that lends an element of sacredness to conflict resolution efforts and to commitments to the obligations undertaken in connection with any agreements or resolutions.</p> <p>Observers have noted that the invitation that King Salman issued to participants explicitly focused on the threats to Saudi Arabia and the UAE from the Houthi militias in Yemen, which Riyadh blames for the attacks against two Saudi oil tankers near the UAE’s Fujeira port and the drone strikes against an Aramco pipeline and the Najran military base. Riyadh wants to martial a sweeping Arab and Islamic condemnation against Iran for its behaviour in the region and, above all, for propelling its proxies into attacking Saudi Arabia which, together with the UAE, has been fighting the Houthis in Yemen since March 2015.</p> <p>While a significant body of opinion appears in favour of a condemnation of Iran as the power responsible for the behaviour of its proxies, as statements by Saudi and Emirati officials have indicated, there appears to be a process of revision in progress concerning the conflict in Yemen. According to Arab affairs expert Mohamed Megahed Al-Zayat, “there is a growing trend that submits that Iran is not responsible for the actions of the Houthis in Yemen and that the Houthi attacks against the Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia and the UAE) were carried out in the context of the current war in Yemen, independently of the escalation between the two sides (the Gulf countries and Iran).”</p> <p>The GCC Summit is scheduled to meet first. Qatar’s addition to the guest list has riveted attention to this summit and stirred speculation as whether this signals a possible reconciliation after two years of boycott. </p> <p>Of course, Qatar’s relationship with Iran, which supported Doha during the boycott, will be another focus of the interplay in Mecca. Doha has frequently spoken out against the escalation in the confrontation with Iran</p> <p><span><a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/27282.aspx">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/27282.aspx</a></span></p> <p>My comment: From Egypt. Obviously, the Houthis did not attack Saudi Arabia, as claimed here, but vice versa.</p> <p>And</p> <p>(* A B P)</p> <p>Why are the summits in Mecca being held?</p> <p>Over the next two days, three summits will be held in Mecca. Two of the summits were called for by Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdul Aziz, one emergency summit for the Gulf states and another for the Arab states, and will be held tomorrow and after. As for the third, it is the 14th session of the OIC Islamic Summit Conference, which will be held under the patronage of the Saudi monarch. The summits are being held during the holy month of Ramadan and in the same place (Mecca), both, the time and place, have special significance and holiness for the Arabs and Muslims.</p> <p>The Arab and Muslim summits no longer achieve anything or dictate the course of events, and whether or not they are held is irrelevant, as they achieve nothing and change nothing. Most of them have become platforms for boring speeches.</p> <p>However, before Saudi Arabia asks the Arab and Islamic countries to support its new policies adopted by the adventurous crown prince, which has made Saudi Arabia a partner in destructive wars, a partner in conspiracies against the Arab governments and people, and a funder of plans that aim to divide and tear apart the region, after being, in the past, a reference, host, and land for peace, coming together, and interests, the Arab countries participating in the two summits must ask their host to stop for a moment and reconsider. They must ask their host to look back on the mistakes of the destructive policies and adverse effects.</p> <p>Over the past years, Saudi Arabia has sought to build Arab and Islamic alliances, both military and non-military, all of which have failed..</p> <p>The Mecca summits will be meaningless and fruitless if they are being held merely to endorse the same policies that led the fragmentation of the region, the destruction of its countries and the displacement of its people.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190530-why-are-the-summits-in-mecca-being-held/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190530-why-are-the-summits-in-mecca-being-held/</a></span></p> <p>and</p> <p>(* B P)</p> <p><span>What Does Saudi Seek Behind Call For Arab Summits?</span></p> <p>Seeking another consensus over Yemen<br /> Apparently, the four-year war led by Saudi Arabia against neighboring Yemen has run into an impasse. Riyadh neither wins the war nor has the courage to admit its defeat.</p> <p>In the middle of the Saudi setbacks, the international pressures are mounting on Riyadh to stop the atrocities against the Yemenis amid an unprecedented humanitarian crisis caused by an all-out blockade and relentless bombing of the infrastructures. Add to this the Yemeni Ansarullah movement’s muscle-flexing before the Saudis over the past few days.</p> <p>Iranophobia in the course to Arab NATO</p> <p>The Saudi regime, Iran’s regional rival and an ideological enemy to the Islamic resistance discourse, has always played the role of an instrument for implementation of Iranophobic policies across the region and Muslim world as a service to the American and Israeli interests and in return for foreign support to keep the rule over the Arabian Peninsula. The Arab League has been an organization that over the past four decades shifted from its set goal of protecting the Arab states against foreign aggression as Saudi Arabia led a campaign of disidentification inside the bloc on the strength of Iranophobia.</p> <p>Seeking to move out of Khashoggi case-caused international isolation</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.islamtimes.org/en/article/795580/what-does-saudi-king-seek-behind-call-for-arab-summits">https://www.islamtimes.org/en/article/795580/what-does-saudi-king-seek-behind-call-for-arab-summits</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.yemenextra.net/2019/05/27/what-does-saudi-seek-behind-call-for-arab-summits/?fbclid=IwAR2WxklgKBygICJWP_hHdc2jv11AxKLfUgtyZ42gAdl1o9U0Hpjw6L_aAf4">https://www.yemenextra.net/2019/05/27/what-does-saudi-seek-behind-call-for-arab-summits/?fbclid=IwAR2WxklgKBygICJWP_hHdc2jv11AxKLfUgtyZ42gAdl1o9U0Hpjw6L_aAf4</a></span></p> <p>(A P)</p> <p>Saudi Arabia gathers Arab leaders over attacks on oil assets</p> <p>Arab leaders gather in Saudi Arabia on Thursday for emergency summits that Riyadh hopes will deliver a strong message to Iran that regional powers will defend their interests against any threat following attacks on Gulf oil assets this month.</p> <p>Saudi and the United Arab Emirates, which have lobbied Washington to contain their foe Iran, have said they want to avoid war after drone strikes on oil pumping stations in the kingdom and the sabotage of oil tankers off the UAE coast.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-summit/saudi-arabia-gathers-arab-leaders-over-attacks-on-oil-assets-idUSKCN1T00OC">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-summit/saudi-arabia-gathers-arab-leaders-over-attacks-on-oil-assets-idUSKCN1T00OC</a></span></p> <p>(B P)</p> <p>With all pride, Gulf kings and Emirs are saying they don't want a war with Iran.

First and foremost, the United States and Israel want an environment conducive to the “deal of the century” and they are trying to force the Arabs to accept it, just as in the early 1990s, when Iraq’s defeat in the war was the prelude to signing the <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180913-remembering-the-arafat-rabin-handshake/">Oslo Accords in 1993</a></span> and the Wadi Araba agreement in 1994.</p> <p>Another reason or motive for the war is the Saudi desire to engage in a direct and deterrent military confrontation with Iran, after over four years of indirect war between Riyadh and Tehran in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia has not been able to win. Instead, the matter continues to snowball due to the threat posed by the Houthis to Saudi Arabia’s security, which has increased over the past four years instead of decreasing.</p> <p>There are a number of motives and justifications that make the war a possibility and a potential, albeit unlikely, option as it is likely that Washington is still adhering to the policy of withdrawal from the Middle East.</p> <p>The main question is what could happen or what would change in the region if a war between the US and Iran breaks out? The answer is as follows:</p> <p>First, a war in the Gulf region will lead to a record-high increase in oil prices, which could return the prices to over $100 a barrel, and could even be higher than the $130-$140 mark. This is especially the case if Saudi Arabia is a direct party in the war, as the kingdom is the world’s largest producer of crude oil and a major player in the market.</p> <p>Second, a direct war with Iran will definitely lead to the expansion of the area of military tension and war in Yemen and Syria, which means further bloodshed and security deterioration in the entire Arab region. This will also involve new numbers of refugees, displaced persons, casualties and wounded. It will also result in the deterioration of living standards for citizens in the entire Arab region.</p> <p>Thirdly, we all know about the high costs of the potential US war on Iran will be paid by the Gulf States, and they may have already started paying the price of the US deployment in the region. We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars.</p> <p>Fourth, Iran’s reaction cannot be predicted, as Iran possesses long-range ballistic missiles, as well as an established presence in four Arab countries, two of which share a border with Israel.</p> <p>The bottom line is that the Arab region could drastically change forever if there is a full-scale war – by Mohammad Ayesh</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190521-what-would-happen-if-a-war-breaks-out-in-the-gulf/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190521-what-would-happen-if-a-war-breaks-out-in-the-gulf/</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vorige / Previous</span></h2> <p><span><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-540-yemen-war-mosaic-540">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-540-yemen-war-mosaic-540</a> </span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 1-540 / Yemen War Mosaic 1-540:</span></h2> <p><span><a href="/autoren/dklose">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose</a> oder / or <a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Der saudische Luftkrieg im Bild / Saudi aerial war images:</span></h2> <p><span>(18 +, Nichts für Sensible!) / (18 +; Graphic!)</span></p> <p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/">http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="http://www.yemenwar.info/">http://www.yemenwar.info/</a> </span></p> <p><span>und alle Liste aller Luftangriffe / and list of all air raids:</span></p> <p><span><a href="http://yemendataproject.org/data/">http://yemendataproject.org/data/</a></span></p></div>

          Yuval Harari ist einer der erfolgreichsten Sachbuchautoren der Welt. Von der „Kurzen Geschichte der Menschheit“ wurden in Deutschland über eine Millionen Exemplare verkauft. Nun erscheint der Weltbestseller als Graphic Novel: Harari noch zugänglicher und unterhaltsamer, aber genauso intelligent und lehrreich - ein Muss nicht nur für seine Fans.
