That has left their Yemeni allies, previously united against the Iranian-supported Houthis who control the country’s north, to battle for supremacy.</p><p>It could hardly come at a worse time.</p><p>The self-rule declaration by the separatist group, the Southern Transitional Council, raises the specter of renewed clashes inside the coalition assembled by Crown Prince Mohammed in 2015 in an effort to oust the Houthi rebels from the Yemeni capital, Sanaa.</p><p>Since January, the Emirates has stopped paying salaries of about $400 to $530 a month to separatist fighters in Aden, a senior council official said. The Saudis refused to make up the shortfall, stirring anger in the ranks.</p><p>Yet the Emiratis continued to pay salaries to Yemeni fighters in other parts of the south, like Hadramout and Shabwa, where their special forces units are deployed on missions to hunt Islamic militants, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid public criticism of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The war within a war adds yet another dimension to the chaos of Yemen, where years of foreign meddling have inflamed long-standing Yemeni rivalries and power struggles. Analysts say that any violent clashes between the two sides are likely to erupt in Abyan governorate, which lies between their forces.</p><p>At the same time, the leaders of those groups are based in neighboring countries.

The last thing the country needs is more fighting. Gulf powers and the UN should help implement a stalled 2019 agreement so that national ceasefire talks can go ahead.</p><p>The STC has not yet taken over day-to-day management of state institutions, but it has formed committees charged with doing so, and STC officials say they will soon start running southern affairs.</p><p>It is not yet clear if the STC’s announcement is indeed an attempt at establishing an autonomous state or a gamble aimed at improving the group’s bargaining position vis-à-vis the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. In justifying their move, STC officials point to stalled implementation of the November 2019 Riyadh Agreement.</p><p>The agreement also stipulates that the STC be integrated into the government’s military and security institutions. The secessionists say they have done everything asked of them, while Hadi has carried out military redeployments that benefit his side and delayed political reforms. </p><p>The STC may also have hoped to shore up its waning popular support. Although the Riyadh Agreement left the STC in effective control of Aden, the government continued to run state institutions and hold purse strings, a situation the STC says played to the government’s advantage by tying its own hands. Since January, STC officials assert, the government has halted salary payments in Aden and allowed public services to wither. Hadi officials acknowledge the holdup in paying salaries – which in the case of most STC security and military forces were anyway paid by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) until the end of 2019 – but attribute it to cash flow problems. They claim that the deterioration of services derives from tensions among the STC, the government and Aden-based Saudi forces.</p><p>The actor best placed to make a difference in the south is the UAE. Abu Dhabi has a close relationship with the STC, whose president, Aydrous al-Zubaidi, is based in the UAE.</p><p>Some Yemeni observers believe that the conflict in the south is creating an opportunity for the Huthis to strike a deal with the STC that excludes the government. This eventuality would accelerate the country’s fragmentation. The rebels and secessionists view each other as lesser threats compared to other rivals and, in theory, such a deal could benefit both. Yet officially, each side says it will negotiate with the other only within a UN-led framework. The infighting also increases pressure on Saudi Arabia, which hopes to find an exit from the war and reach an acceptable accommodation with the Huthis before the anti-Huthi front collapses under the weight of its internal differences.</p><p>A Modest Rather than Maximalist Approach</p><p>In many ways, the STC’s timing could not be worse for UN efforts to secure a nationwide ceasefire, initiate a national COVID-19 response plan and restart political talk</p><p>Instead of taking a maximalist approach, the two sides could agree on minimum requirements for implementation</p><p>Beyond the Riyadh Agreement, the STC is right in saying that the UN’s national ceasefire initiative will not work without its cooperation.</p><p>Under an imperfect compromise, the UN – with help from the UK and U.S. – could push the Hadi government and Saudi Arabia to ensure that the STC and other important armed groups have a voice in military talks by adding representatives aligned with or even chosen by them to the government delegation in the military body. </p><p>Events in the south are a stark reminder of Yemen’s fragmentation after five years of war. They underscore the necessity of including sub-national groups, like the STC, in any overall settlement to end the conflict. Regional and Western diplomats working on Yemen so far have largely avoided the south’s messy politics, and they may be tempted even now to leave the problem to the Saudis. But more of the same will not make the problem go away, and failure to engage will only make the war harder to end – by Crisis Group</p><p><span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/heading-renewed-struggle-yemens-south">https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/heading-renewed-struggle-yemens-south</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Folter und Vergewaltigung sollen Schweigen erzwingen</strong></p><p>Widerspruch kann im Jemen gefährlich werden - erst recht für Frauen. Berichten zufolge sind Hunderte in geheimen Gefängnissen eingesperrt, wo sie von Mitgliedern der Huthi-Bewegung regelmäßig verprügelt und vergewaltigt werden.</p><p><span>Eine nach der anderen verschwanden sie. Die Aktivistin Samera al-Huri war ratlos. Als sie bei den Familien ihrer Mitstreiterinnen nachfragte, erhielt sie stets die gleiche kryptische Antwort: „Sie ist verreist“, hieß es. Einige der Frauen tauchten schließlich wieder auf. Die meisten wirkten gebrochen und wollten nicht sagen, wo sie die ganzen Monate gewesen waren. Inzwischen weiß Al-Huri, was passiert war - sie musste es am eigenen Leibe erfahren.</span></p><p><span>Im Morgengrauen standen plötzlich Huthi-Rebellen vor ihrem Haus in der Hauptstadt Sanaa. Die Männer, etwa ein Dutzend, nahmen sie mit und brachten sie in den Keller einer umfunktionierten Schule. Al-Huri sah schmutzige Zellen voller weiblicher Gefangener. Bei ihrer „Vernehmung“ wurde sie mit Schlägen und Elektroschocks gefoltert. Dann wurde ihr ein Termin für ihre angeblich geplante Hinrichtung genannt. Erst im letzten Moment hieß es, diese sei abgesagt worden.</span></p><p><span>Al-Huri ist kein Einzelfall. Frauen, die im Norden des Jemens öffentlich Kritik an der von den Huthis kontrollierten Verwaltung äußern, werden brutal verfolgt. Aktivistinnen und Überlebende berichten der Nachrichtenagentur AP von einem geheimen Netz aus Haftanstalten, in denen Folter und Vergewaltigung an der Tagesordnung seien. „Viele hatten es noch schlimmer als ich“, sagt Al-Huri. Die 33-Jährige war laut eigenen Angaben drei Monate eingesperrt - bis sie eingewilligt habe, bezüglich erfundener Vorwürfe der Prostitution vor laufender Kamera ein Geständnis aufzusagen.</span></p><p><span>Frauen sind im Jemen zunehmend politisch aktiv.</span></p><p><span>„Dies ist die düsterste Zeit für jemenitische Frauen“, sagt Rascha Dscharhum, Gründerin der Peace Track Initiative, die sich dafür einsetzt, Frauen in die Friedensgespräche zwischen den Huthis und der international anerkannten Regierung miteinzubeziehen. Die Zahl der inhaftierten Frauen liegt laut vorsichtigen Schätzungen von mehreren Menschenrechtsorganisationen bei 200 bis 350 allein in der Region um Sanaa. Nura al-Dscharwi, Leiterin der Women for Peace in Yemen Coalition, hat 33 Fälle von Vergewaltigung und acht Fälle von schwerer Folter dokumentiert.</span></p><p><span>Die AP hat mit sechs ehemaligen Gefangenen gesprochen, die nach Kairo flüchten konnten, bevor wegen der Coronavirus-Krise auch in diesem Teil der Welt Grenzen geschlossen und fast alle Flüge gestrichen wurden. Die Schilderungen der Frauen decken sich mit einem kürzlich veröffentlichten Bericht eines Expertengremiums der Vereinten Nationen.</span></p><p>Die gezielte Verfolgung von Frauen begann Ende 2017. Damals gab es Demonstrationen, nachdem die Huthis ihren einstigen Verbündeten, den langjährigen jemenitischen Präsidenten Ali Abdullah Saleh, getötet hatten. Das Ausmaß sei anschließend stetig erweitert worden, sagt Al-Dscharwi. „Zunächst nahmen sie Oppositionsführerinnen ins Visier, dann Demonstrantinnen, jetzt jede Frau, die Kritik an ihnen äußert.“</p><p><span>Opfer von sexueller Gewalt werden in der patriarchalen jemenitischen Gesellschaft oft von ihren Familien geächtet, manchmal sogar getötet, um eine vermeintliche „Ehre“ zu retten. Auch die ehemalige Geschichtslehrerin wurde von ihrer Familie abgewiesen, nachdem ihre Peiniger sie im März 2018 einfach unter einer Brücke abgeladen hatten.</span></p><p><span>Nach Angaben vieler Betroffener ist es zudem gängige Methode, erzwungene Geständnisse zu filmen und die Aufnahmen später als Druckmittel zu benutzen.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://rp-online.de/panorama/ausland/jemen-folter-und-vergewaltigung-in-gefaengnise-sollen-schweigen-erzwingen_aid-50316595">https://rp-online.de/panorama/ausland/jemen-folter-und-vergewaltigung-in-gefaengnise-sollen-schweigen-erzwingen_aid-50316595</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Women who dare dissent targeted for abuse by Yemen's rebels</strong></p><p>Samera al-Huri´s fellow activists were disappearing, one by one. When she asked their families, each gave the same cryptic reply: "She´s traveling." A few of the women re-emerged. But they seemed broken and refused to say where they had been for months.</p><p>Al-Huri soon found out.</p><p>A dozen officers from the Houthi rebels who control northern Yemen snatched her from her home in the capital, Sanaa, at dawn.</p><p>They took her to the basement of a converted school, its filthy cells filled with female detainees. Interrogators beat her bloody, gave her electrical shocks and, as psychological torture, scheduled her execution only to call it off last-minute.</p><p>Women who dare dissent, or even enter the public sphere, have become targets in an escalating crackdown by the Houthis.</p><p>Activists and former detainees described to The Associated Press a network of secret detention facilities where they are tortured and sometimes raped. Taiz Street, a main avenue in Sanaa, is dotted with several of them, hidden inside private villas and the school where al-Huri was held.</p><p>"Many had it worse than me," said al-Huri, 33, who survived three months in detention until she confessed on camera to fabricated prostitution charges, a grave insult in conservative Yemen.</p><p>Long-held traditions and tribal protections once guarded women from detention and abuse, but those taboos are succumbing to the pressures of war.</p><p>As men die in battle or languish in jail in a conflict now dragging into its sixth year, Yemeni women have increasingly taken political roles. In many cases, women are organizing protests, leading movements, working for international organizations or advocating peace initiatives - all acts the Houthis increasingly view as a threat.</p><p>Systematic arrests and prisons rife with torture have been central to war efforts by both sides, the Iranian-backed Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition trying to oust them, the AP has found.</p><p>Yet the intimidation campaign against women, observers say, is unique to rebel-held areas.</p><p>Estimates of women currently detained range from 200 to 350 in the governorate of Sanaa alone, according to multiple rights groups. The Yemeni Organization for Combating Human Trafficking says that´s likely an undercount.</p><p>Other provinces are more difficult to pin down. Noura al-Jarwi, head of the Women for Peace in Yemen Coalition, estimates that over 100 women are detained in Dhamar province south of the capital, a major crossing point from government-controlled areas into Houthi-run territory.</p><p>Al-Jarwi, who runs an informal support group in Cairo for women released from Houthi detention, has documented 33 cases of rape and eight instances of women debilitated by torture.</p><p>The AP met with six former detainees who managed to flee to Cairo before the coronavirus pandemic grounded flights and closed borders. Their accounts are supported by a recent report from a U.N. panel of experts, which said sexual violations may amount to war crimes.</p><p>A WIDENING CRACKDOWN</p><p>The first major round-up of women came in late 2017, after the Houthis killed their one-time ally in the war, former ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh. The rebels detained scores of women who thronged public squares, chanting for the return of Saleh´s body.</p><p>The scope has expanded since, said al-Jarwi.

Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar during the Sa’ada wars</p><p>On Jan. 22, four days after a suspected Houthi missile <span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/266">strike</a></span> killed more than 110 government soldiers at an army training camp on the outskirts of Marib city, Houthi intelligence officials ordered Yemen’s main telecommunications companies to block internet and mobile phone networks in large swathes of frontline territory northwest of the rebel-controlled capital Sana’a. </p><p>The orders, forwarded to a small group of employees at one of the telecom companies in an email viewed by Almasdar Online, named three districts in the governorate of Sana’a, two districts in Marib governorate, five areas in Al-Jawf governorate and “all sites overlooking the confrontation areas.”</p><p>Because government and tribal forces fighting the Houthis rely heavily on the Sana’a-based telecom services to communicate, the Houthis have been able to block the internet and phone networks for military advantage. The blackouts also restrict the flow of information among civilians, allowing the rebels to shape narratives about the conflicts. </p><p>The telecom blockade wasn’t lifted until early March, by which time the Houthis had consolidated control over many of the locations listed in the email – most importantly, the Al-Jawf’s capital Al-Hazm – according to residents in the affected areas and a telecom worker who received the email. </p><p>Houthi forces have since set their sights on oil-rich Marib – and in recent weeks, they resumed blocking telecom networks there.</p><p>The fall of Al-Jawf</p><p>The information blackout hit Al-Jawf in waves. On Jan. 23, the country’s three main mobile phone networks – MTN Yemen, Sabafon and Yemen Mobile – stopped working throughout the governorate. Less than 10 days later, land-based internet connections went offline, and landline telephones were cut on Feb. 14. None of the services returned until the fall of Al-Hazm city at the beginning of March, according to the director of the governorate’s information department Yahya Qama'a.</p><p>At various times during the month-long blackout in Al-Hazm, the mobile phone networks would briefly turn on and residents reported receiving calls from people they described as Houthi loyalists providing misleading updates about the unfolding clashes.</p><p>“They spread rumors about the fall of key positions in Al-Jawf and the targeting of government leaders,” Qama’a said, noting that the disinformation contributed to the general sense of panic as tens of thousands of people fled the governorate.</p><p>Others in Al-Hazm reported Houthi missile strikes when the mobile networks would briefly reconnect, insisting that the rebels use cell phone location technology to guide the missiles.</p><p>“We were facing a militia with the capabilities of a state,” he said. </p><p>The telecom blackouts help explain why strategic towns and military positions the internationally recognized government and tribal allies had held since 2016 fell so quickly. </p><p>Aside from the limited use of walkie talkies by some army units, anti-Houthi forces largely rely on the Sana’a-based internet and phone infrastructure to communicate on the battlefield. Several commanders told Almasdar Online that obtaining sophisticated military communication tools has been one of the Yemeni army’s top requests ignored by the Saudi-led coalition.</p><p>However, incompetence, infighting and a lack of coordination by the Yemeni forces and their Saudi backers also played a role in the swift military defeats, according to <span><a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/running-around-circles-how-saudi-arabia-losing-its-war-yemen-iran">analysts</a></span>. </p><p>If the Houthis attempt to seize Marib city by force, blocking communications would likely be part of such a massive undertaking. Doing so would undercut the ability of the army, tribes and civilians to organize and defend the city of 1.8 million. Similar to what happened in Al-Jawf’s capital, an information blackout in Marib city would fuel chaos as residents flee the desert metropolis via two highways. </p><p>Journalists and civilians documenting the violence would be silenced.</p><p>“The telecom cuts cause great psychological stress as you hear a large number of rumors about the battles along with the lack of knowledge of what is really going on around you,” said Abdulilah Al-Hawd, a freelance journalist who was in Al-Hazm when the Houthis captured the city. </p><p>Blocking internet and mobile phone networks has featured in numerous Houthi military offensives, including the failed attempts to seize Marib city in 2015, the ongoing siege of Taiz city, a six-month battle for the Red Sea city of Hodeidah in 2018 and the crushing defeat of Al-Hajour tribal fighters in northwest Yemen in mid-2019, according to a former telecom engineer with firsthand knowledge of the network cuts. </p><p>When Houthi forces are about to launch a new military offensive or need help during an ongoing battle, intelligence officials contact relay the locations to loyalists in the telecom companies, he explained. “The radio and transmission guys identify the sites, then send a request to the network operators who are able to ‘lock’ them remotely and observe whether any signals from other sites could reach that area,” he said.</p><p>During the blackouts, Houthi military forces have access to their own network, he added. </p><p>The Houthi-Saleh alliance ultimately disintegrated in 2017, culminating in the rebels’ assassination of the former president in December of that year. With unrivaled control over Yemen’s telecom backbone in Sana’a, the Houthis have tightened their grip on the sector to eliminate threats to their rule just as Saleh attempted to do during the Sa’ada wars. </p><p>The army general who spearheaded the Sa’ada wars, Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar, is now vice president of the internationally recognized government. Much of his time in Yemen is spent in Marib, overseeing the largest concentration of army troops in the country. With President Hadi rumored to be suffering from health problems, Ali Mohsen is thought to be playing the role of commander-in-chief overseeing battles in the northern governorates, once again fighting the Houthis. Only this time around the Houthis have control of the telecommunications he helped weaponize at their expense – by Casey Coombs</p><p><span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/716">https://al-masdaronline.net/national/716</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>CARPO / YPC Brief 17: The Role of Youth in Peacebuilding in Yemen</strong></p><p>Executive Summary</p><p>Following five years of devastating civil war, around 30 million people in Yemen are suffering from multiple crises – violent conflict, a collapsed economy, looming famine, displacement, loss of livelihoods and collapsing public services. However, such dire conditions have not stood in the way of young people across the country seeking to contribute to restoring and building peace in their war-torn country, as they play vital and positive roles in different sectors for the purpose of not only helping to voice people’s hopes and de- sire to live in a stable and safe state, but also in cementing solid ground and the foundation for sustainable peace.</p><p>Despite its major transformative potential, local level youth work is often overlooked by mainstream international discourses on national level peace processes and violent conflict.* This Brief sheds light on young peoples’ activism before and during the war, the challenges they are currently facing, their visions for the future of Yemen and the kind of support they need. The contributions of young men and women to the economy, politics, culture and so- city, education, security and justice, and the environment show how youth are laying the groundwork for peace and social cohesion in their communities.</p><p>From Introduction</p><p>Youth activists are facing a wide range of seemingly insurmountable challenges – from a failing economy and a collapse in educational opportunities through to direct security threats and restrictions on their speech and movements. Even so, large numbers of youth across the country have sought out ways to positively contribute, particularly at community level, finding new spaces and new ways of working.</p><p>Travel restrictions have forced activism to the local and community level, and the security situation has shifted the focus of youth to supporting humanitarian, health, environ- mental and social causes rather than overtly ‘political’ work.4 Youth initiatives are pro- viding public services amid collapsing state services and a lack of international development projects. The types of work that youth engage in vary significantly from one governorate to another, influenced by the level of direct conflict in their area, the attitudes and behaviors of the local de facto authorities, and the amount of support being received from the international community.</p><p>Young men and women in rural and urban areas see their potential to positively contribute to peacebuilding across six areas specified above: the economy, politics, culture and society, security and justice, education and the environment. Many youth believe that small, community-level contributions are significant in themselves, as they contribute to building relationships and social cohesion in their communities; lay stepping stones to sustainable peace in the longer term; and reduce the cycle of violence by providing productive opportunities for young men and women outside of violence.</p><p><span><a href="https://carpo-bonn.org/portfolio/carpo-ypc-brief-17-the-role-of-youth-in-peacebuilding-in-yemen/">https://carpo-bonn.org/portfolio/carpo-ypc-brief-17-the-role-of-youth-in-peacebuilding-in-yemen/</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Coronavirus und Seuchen / Most important: Coronavirus and epidemics</span></h2><p><span>(* A H)</span></p><p><span>Bürgerkriegsland Jemen meldet die ersten beiden Corona-Toten</span></p><p>Der Jemen hat als letztes Land auf der Arabischen Halbinsel seiner ersten beiden Corona-Toten gemeldet.

Congress of the US</p><p>At a time when countries around the world are scrambling to respond to COVID-19 and ensure that hospitals can treat all patients, Yemen has entered the sixth year of a war that has destroyed our healthcare system.</p><p>Between 2015 and 2018, Mwatana documented 120 attacks on health facilities and medical personnel, by all parties to the conflict, across 20 of Yemen’s 22 governorates. In a report with Physicians for Human Rights, we illustrated how these attacks contributed to the disastrous humanitarian situation in Yemen.</p><p>Our report found that the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates –armed by the US, the UK, and EU countries – is responsible for destroying and damaging Yemen’s health facilities through airstrikes. Houthis, as well as other armed groups loyal to the Yemeni government and the coalition, also have damaged and destroyed health facilities with indiscriminate shelling, and occupied medical facilities. All sides to the conflict have killed medical workers.</p><p>This destruction contributed to a catastrophic situation. Yemenis have suffered a record outbreak of cholera, an easily preventable disease. Now, our worst fear is another epidemic. Although COVID-19 is novel to the entire world, the disease will be specifically deadly for countries in conflict, like Yemen.</p><p>On April 10, the first COVID-19 case <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/first-case-covid-19-reported-authorities-yemen">was confirmed</a></span> in Yemen. Although there have not yet been official announcements of other cases since, Yemenis continue to die every day because of the war. They are dying in airstrikes and shelling. They are dying of preventable diseases. They are dying of hunger and much more.</p><p>I urge Congress to take action to help end civilian suffering in Yemen, not only due to the devastating impact COVID-19 will have on my country, but because of the devastation that <em>has already occurred </em>as a result of this unnecessary war that has been allowed to go on too long.</p><p>There are three things the US could do, right now, to make a real difference.</p><p>First, promote accountability and redress for abuses.</p><p>To end the cycles of violence in Yemen, the warring parties must know they will be held accountable for violations, and will have to provide redress to their civilian victims.</p><p>Second, stop fueling the war. End US military support to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and push for a political agreement to end the conflict.</p><p>The collapse of the Yemeni state and the empowerment of armed groups all over Yemen is the biggest threat to Yemen’s future. Yemenis need a political agreement that helps them to achieve their continued dream of a state based on the rule of law and democracy.</p><p>This can be achieved only through a real political agreement between all parties to the conflict, which requires real US pressure on your allies, and an end to US arms sales and other military support.</p><p>I believe action by Congress played an essential role in achieving the Stockholm agreement in 2018, the partial UAE withdrawal from active combat, and the willingness of Saudi Arabia to negotiate. But this pressure must continue.</p><p>Third: address the health, humanitarian, and economic crisis in Yemen.</p><p>The warring parties have weaponized Yemen’s food and economy. Yemeni civil servants, including some health workers, have not been paid salaries for nearly two years.. Even given that context, the US Government recently decided to <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/world/middleeast/yemen-health-care-aid-coronavirus.html">cut your humanitarian assistance</a></span> to Yemen, in response to Houthi aid interference. An end to this interference is crucial. But the US decision to withdraw humanitarian funding for Yemen at a time of our greatest need risks creating an escalating catastrophe; it will not punish the Houthis, it will punish Yemen’s already vulnerable civilians.</p><p>Stopping COVID-19 will require doctors and scientists working together worldwide. Stopping the war and the humanitarian crisis in Yemen needs only influential decision-makers, like this Congress, to follow your consciences and act with strong will. You can help end this crisis, if you choose to do so.</p><p><span><a href="https://mwatana.org/en/radhya-speech/">https://mwatana.org/en/radhya-speech/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong>Repercussions of Coronavirus in Yemen ... Another War</strong></p><p>According to these factors, this paper discusses possible repercussions and impact of Corona pandemic in Yemen, according to three main axes: military / political, health / humanitarian, and economic.</p><p>First: The Impact of Coronavirus Pandemic on War and Politics</p><p>Yemen has entered a state of war since September 2014 when the Houthis took control of the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, with the support of the remaining military and administrative system of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and toppled the legitimate government that subsequently requested the international community - the Gulf states in particular - to intervene to topple "the coup" and stop its control over the country.</p><p>In March 2015, the Saudi-led coalition intervened in support of the government to launch deterrent air strikes against the Houthis. The air raids did not succeed and the Houthis continued to control Sana'a and most of the densely populated northern governorates. During the war, epidemics broke out in the country, making it the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.</p><p>There has been no significant change in the military map since the beginning of 2018 and the forces remained in their positions in the same fighting fronts until March 2020, when the Houthis took control of the city of Al-Hazm, the center of the strategic Al-Jawf governorate, north of the country, on border with Saudi Arabia, threatening the Yemeni government stronghold in Marib governorate.</p><p>The Houthis started military escalation, despite the United Nations peace calls for ceasefire in Yemen in order to fight the Coronavirus. Several changes have made the Corona pandemic an opportunity to reach a peace agreement in the country. In addition, some indicators have made the United Nations and other countries believe that the fight against Coronavirus can be a good opportunity to stop the war in the country. Those indicators include the following:</p><p>Exploiting the Pandemic</p><p>Local and international parties are taking advantage of the ceasefire and the Coronavirus to implement war-related plans or "legitimacy of survival" as follows:</p><p>Secondly: The impact of Coronavirus on the public health system and humanitarian situation in Yemen</p><p>From the perspective of the spread of the Corona epidemic in other countries, the virus is very dangerous. Yemen represents a refreshing environment for Coronavirus and there are many factors that may help in spreading out the pandemic with a high average of infections and deaths: a large population (approximately 30 million), a poor health care system, the years-long war that exhausted the population and made the situation the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, and the country's population has become very dependent and unable to live without assistance from outside. Almost 24.1 million depend on foreign assistance and other 14.3 million are in dire need of aid.<span><a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a></span> Millions are on the brink of starvation and hundreds of thousands of children suffer from malnutrition and acute malnutrition, which means that the natural immunity to Coronavirus is not sufficient in a war-torn country like Yemen.</p><p>The country is already suffering from high levels of malnutrition and epidemic diseases such as cholera due to the ongoing war, which increased up to 132 percent last year, compared to 2018. More than 56,000 suspected cases were registered in the first seven weeks of 2020.<span><a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></span> The number is likely to rise further during the rainy season in Yemen that started in April.<span><a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a></span></p><p>Yemen confirmed its first case of coronavirus on April 11, 2020 in Hadramawt, southeastern Yemen, the country's largest governorate. United Nations and relief officials believe that the virus is likely to have spread more widely, and that the increase of infections in Saudi Arabia reinforces these doubts.<span><a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></span></p><p>It is difficult to know exactly about Coronavirus in Yemen because of the limited number of testing laboratories and people’s fears of reporting. The virus is likely to spread among Yemenis before the authorities realize its existence in the country. The prevalence of the virus is possible due to poor living conditions, lack of personal protective equipment, population density, the difficulty in applying hygiene behaviors and the culture of social distancing in a society that sanctifies the social gatherings and people go to the khat markets every day, making the enforcement of containment measures so difficult.</p><p>Obstacles to Coronavirus fight</p><p>Countering Coronavirus:</p><p>Third: The Economic Situation</p><p>The country's economy collapsed during war, according to official estimates, and Yemen lost fifty billion dollars during the period (2015-2019).<span><a href="#_ftn32">[32]</a></span> The World Bank estimates that Yemen's GDP has shrunk by nearly 50% since 2014. In the first quarter of 2020, the economic predictions indicate that total economic conditions are likely to continue to deteriorate.<span><a href="#_ftn33">[33]</a></span></p><p>It is difficult for the authorities and researchers to estimate the size of the economic losses in light of the current situation of the conflict and the parallel “war economy” activity, which seems to be a great driver of the economy in the country. But according to the study of epidemics in multiple times and regions, many areas will be critically affected.</p><p>Food Security:</p><p>The country has been in war for years and that has already affected food security as 80-90% of Yemen’s needs depend on imports. The food security situation is worsening due to the lack of humanitarian access to people who are in urgent need of food assistance, as well as the lack of funding as some donors stopped funding.</p><p>The crisis of Corona pandemic outbreak around the world will affect Yemen significantly for a long term due to the possible impact of Corona crisis on the supply chains and financial markets in other countries. Consequently, disturbances of external chains of supply beginning with wheat fields in Ukraine, and other places, can lead to a significant shortage of imports that will significantly affect "food security" in poor countries like Yemen.</p><p>The high levels of sovereign debts will hinder the governments’ ability to spend on stimulus plans that may help the economy during the next troublesome months and years</p><p>Conclusion and Recommendations:</p><p>1- In politics and war, Yemen does not only need a temporary truce, but also needs a complete cessation of war as long as Yemen faces a common threat of Corona that threatens all Yemenis. It is possible to begin with a temporary truce for several months to devote efforts to confront Corona and its expected catastrophic consequences. This step will only be achieved through concessions from the two parties of the war to reach a final formula that gives priority for health services and the economic development through forming joint specialized committees that manage these files. The priority in forming committees should be given to parliamentary committees and technical and logistical support offices to realize the purpose. All these committees and offices should be connected to a joint operations room with the supportive Gulf States and donor organizations, especially the United Nations.</p><p>2- To reduce the health consequences:</p><p>The two parties of conflict, in their control areas, should update the Infection Prevention Protocols, with regarding the commitment of the people to international virus prevention measures and strictly following them at all levels of health services, focusing mainly on emergency departments and outpatient clinics. The suspected cases of infection must be subjected to strict surveillance, and must be immediately reported to the concerned organizations.</p><p>It is also a priority to neutralize the health sector from the parties of the conflict, start paying the salaries of health sector employees, improve the services of government hospitals and set up quarantine camps in each governorate with opening the opportunity to volunteers from students of the College of Medicine and Nursing as well as health workers and even doctors and specialists from outside Yemen..</p><p>3- On the Economic Side:</p><p>The priority of food security will be through paying salaries of the state employees, securing food and health supplies, imposing control on the health materials markets and filling the black holes that devour the public funds through controlling the purchases of oil derivatives, operating the Aden refineries and the Marib Gas Power Station, reproducing oil and gas, and fighting the “war economy” and corruption through joint committees under international supervision, especially with regard to the State’s revenues such as oil, customs and taxes, and ensuring that they are fully transferred to the Central Bank of Yemen.</p><p><span><a href="https://abaadstudies.org/news-59838.html">https://abaadstudies.org/news-59838.html</a></span></p><p>(* B H)</p><p>Yemen: Urgent Measures Needed to Protect Civilians from COVID-19</p><p>[Appeal by 30 NGOs]</p><p>The warring parties, donor states, the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU) must take immediate and urgent steps to mitigate COVID-19’s potential outbreak and catastrophic impact in Yemen.</p><p>In the face of COVID-19, civilians in Yemen are particularly and acutely vulnerable. Due to the war, the health system has been severely damaged. The warring parties have obstructed and impeded humanitarian aid. Other contagious diseases have spread, including in detention facilities</p><p>The health sector in Yemen has been decimated, the economy has crumbled, and the humanitarian response has been repeatedly and blatantly obstructed and interfered with by the warring parties.</p><p>The routine destruction and repeated occupation of health care facilities, as well as the killing and wounding of medical workers, has weakened Yemen’s health system, inflicted widespread suffering on civilians, and contributed to making the country increasingly vulnerable to health shocks like that posed by COVID-19.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, those already vulnerable—the displaced, those deprived of their liberty, refugees, migrants, the sick, hungry, and poor—have been and will be hit the hardest.</p><p>Releasing Arbitrarily Held and Vulnerable Detainees and Improving Detention Conditions</p><p>Hundreds of civilians, including journalists and human rights defenders, have been <span><a href="https://mwatana.org/en/detention-places-in-yemen/">arbitrarily detained and disappeared</a></span> by the warring parties. Conditions of detention in Yemen are abysmal. Detention facilities are overcrowded, unsanitary, and have already witnessed the spread of contagious diseases. Health care is routinely not available and in some cases all together denied to detainees, while prison systems do not have the capacity, medical supplies or resources to respond to COVID-19.</p><p>These conditions put detainees and prisoners at heightened risk in times of a pandemic. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) <span><a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/protecting-prison-populations-infectious-disease">warned</a></span> that “in an overcrowded prison, once one person has COVID-19 it’s likely that hundreds of people will have it […] That means you’ll see a higher mortality rate in this prison population.”</p><p>In this context, the Group of Eminent International and Regional Experts on Yemen called on parties to take effective measures to mitigate the spread of the disease, including by releasing prisoners and detainees who are “particularly vulnerable and exposed to substantial risk” in “appalling detention conditions.” I</p><p>Adopting a Human Rights-Based Response to COVID-19</p><p>While the authorities in various parts of Yemen have a responsibility to take preventive measures and other steps to protect people in areas under their control from the spread of COVID-19, any response must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Children below five years old are 11% of the total caseload and 30% of the total death cases. Dengue outbreaks have affected 174 of 333 total districts (54%) in 22 of 23 governorates of the country.

Most reported cases are concentrated in urban areas. The number of affected governorates increased due to the collapse of the health system in Yemen resulting from ongoing complex and protracted conflict, the poor water and hygiene condition in the most affected areas, with limited access to humanitarian support to the most vulnerable and affected populations.</p><p>From January to December 2019, 59,486 dengue suspected cases and 219 death cases with case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.4% were reported.

Hätten humanitäre Gründe in diesem Krieg jemals etwas bedeutet, dann hätte Saudi-Arabien nicht jahrelang gezielt Zivilisten und zivile Infrastruktur im Jemen bombardiert – und dann würde sich in dem Land nicht, wie es die UN bereits 2018 einschätzten, die größte humanitäre Katastrophe der Gegenwart abspielen, ein Titel, um den stete Konkurrenz mit dem Desaster in Syrien besteht. Auch Seuchen haben die saudischen Strategen nie gestört, wie die anhaltende Bedrohung durch die Cholera gezeigt hat. Nach Einschätzung der UN-Hilfskoordinatorin für den Jemen, Lise Grande, ist mindestens die Hälfte der jemenitischen Bevölkerung in einem schlechten Gesundheitszustand, drei Viertel der Bevölkerung benötigen humanitäre Hilfe oder Schutz.</span></p><p><span>Eine Auswirkung auf den Krieg hatte diese Lage nur insofern, als die von den Saudis geführte und bezahlte Koalition, von der die international anerkannte jemenitische Regierung militärisch abhängig ist, in ihrer Selbstdarstellung mittlerweile ihr Vorgehen als eine Art humanitärer Mission verkauft. Die Realität des saudischen Luftkriegs im Jemen widerspricht dem.</span></p><p>Im Sommer 2019 zogen sich die Emirate aus dem Konflikt zurück und überließen den Saudis das Problem. Seitdem hat die saudische Koalition herbe Niederlagen erlitten.

Eine solche könnten etwa eine Verschlechterung des labilen Gesundheitszustands Präsident Hadis und die Frage nach einem Nachfolger auslösen. Der saudische Versuch, dem Konflikt zu entkommen, solange das noch kontrolliert möglich ist, scheint so verständlich wie illusorisch.

After about five years of fighting, it was clear that the coalition forces were incapable of subduing the Houthis, although Riyadh had originally hoped to eliminate them within a few weeks. As a result, Saudi Arabia and U.S. President Donald Trump found themselves in a confrontation with the U.S. Congress, which held Crown Prince Mohammed responsible for the killing of thousands of Yemenis – as well as for the murder of journalist and Saudi regime opponent Jamal Khashoggi.</span></p><p>But the hostilities have not ceased in the months since the agreement was signed. Indeed, it now appears that the political process, in which the United Nations is also involved, has reached an impasse.

In the meantime, fighting continues on the ground, aid organizations are finding it difficult to reach the needy with food and medication, and health services are little more than an abstract concept.

If the Trump administration wasn’t so determined to bring Iran to its knees through “maximum pressure,” the regime in Tehran might be more inclined to use whatever influence it has with the Houthis to persuade the rebels to drop maximalist demands.

Yet their inability to resolve Hadi-STC disputes or reach a ceasefire deal with the Houthis has exposed their lack of leverage.</p><p>A GROUP EFFORT</p><p>The past six months have shown that the Saudis are hard-pressed to end the war on their own.

And of course, it's many years later and they're still in the quagmire making absolutely no notable progress, very much like the Americans in Vietnam.<br /> In both cases, these wars have inflicted horrific suffering on civilian populations. </p><p>Another comparison between Yemen and Vietnam is that in both cases, we had an empire, very, very wealthy aggressive empire, trying to extend its power versus local troops who were fighting for local self-determination whether it's the Vietnamese fighting for an independent Vietnam, or the Yemenis fighting for an independent Yemen.<br /> And in both cases, these wars happened just as there was an economic shock around the world oil trade happening</p><p>The economic shock around the US being unable to come up with enough gold to supply the demands for gold by people who wanted to trade in their dollars for gold especially the French was part of the reason that it became clear the US couldn't afford to continue trying to win in Vietnam.<br /> Today we're seeing something similar, except now, it's the petrodollar standard that is collapsing as the US is being challenged geo-politically and economically by independent nations led by China, and, of course, Russia and Iran as well.</p><p>So, the Saudi quagmire in Yemen is very similar to the US quagmire in Vietnam and at some point the Saudis are going to have to do what the Americans did when the Americans had that kind of embarrassing evacuation from Saigon with helicopters dragging the last people off the roof clinging to the bottom of the helicopters.

Flooding has damaged roads, bridges and the electricity grid, and contaminated water supplies, cutting access to basic services for thousands of people. In Sana’a, flooding caused widespread disruption to services as the city was inundated by floodwaters. In Aden, power cuts have continued since the floods of 21 April. There is heightened risk of diseases such as malaria and cholera. Already, more than 110,000 cases of suspected cholera have been recorded across 290 of Yemen’s 333 districts since January this year, with growing fears that the number of cases will spiral. More heavy rains and thunderstorms are expected in the east and parts of the western coast, as well as in desert areas in Marib, Al Jawf, and Shabwah governorates.</p><p>HUMANITARIAN IMPACT AND NEEDS</p><p>An estimated 21,240 families (148,680 people) have been affected by flooding in 13 governorates since mid-April.<br /> Conditions are hardest for thousands of families already displaced who have lost shelter, food rations and household supplies. In Marib Governorate, torrential rains affected 6,286 families including 7 fatalities while 250 people were injured. The rains also caused houses to collapse, and damaged infrastructure making some roads impassable in Raymah Governorate and Marib City and surrounding areas. In Sana’a and northern governorates, at least 9,146 families were affected, with Sana’a City and most parts of Sana’a governorate particularly badly hit by flooding. Over 5,130 families have been affected in Hajjah Governorate alone, and partners have reported severe damage to shelters at sites for internally displaced persons (IDPs) as a result urgent needs for WASH interventions and food assistance are required. An estimated 4,764 households have been affected in IDP sites in southern governorates, including 1,812 families in Aden, 1,037 in Abyan, 917 in Taizz and 770 in Lahj governorates. In Aden City, the worst affected areas are Crater and Mualla.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-flash-floods-flash-update-no-3-30-april-2020">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-flash-floods-flash-update-no-3-30-april-2020</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Yemeni civil society organisations support peacebuilding work of community groups</p><p>In Yemen, our partners the <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NodsYemen.info/">National Organisation for Community Development (NODS)</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/YWBODYemen/">Youth Without Borders (YWBOD)</a></span>, and <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Alf-Ba-Civilization-and-Coexistence-Foundation-462856367083043/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARA3nhd4JMEWoSIe0p0cp44OzChYlQlkSkXlloxYJFEwln2FUDedg6YtmKfMKkA2bjvxTEd1AHMiyRIh">Alf Ba Civilization and Coexistence Foundation (Alf Ba)</a></span> have been supporting volunteer groups to carry out peacebuilding work to make their communities safer.</p><p>After identifying where support was needed, NODS in Taiz called on community members in Sabr al-Mawadem and al-Qahira districts to help form a community group in each of those areas.

In each region were represented at least women associations, farmers’ cooperatives, voluntary vet associations and community members engaged in the education of the children. However, the political and military upheaval in 2015 had a negative impact on the legal and operating environment for CSOs, as many of them were ransacked or closed.</p><p>In the past ACTED has been mostly engaged in Yemen through provision of assistance to individuals or families through various distributions and activities seeking to improve their living conditions. This project is special as it is the first one where ACTED is supporting civil society organization and helping them to improve their structural management and technical capacities ensuring that they can take on the role of service delivery in their communities over the longer term.</p><p>For the civil society organizations to start blooming again, ACTED organizes trainings for the members on proper management practices. By the end of 2020, the most promising will receive from a financial grant to implement a project that will benefit their target communities.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.acted.org/en/acted-supports-the-revival-of-civil-society-in-yemen/">https://www.acted.org/en/acted-supports-the-revival-of-civil-society-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Film (Arabic): </span>Watch the suffering of civilians, stories, pain and families paying the tax of siege and displacement, in which children suffer from disease, fear and disability</p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/wfahd1000/status/1255617464609669121">https://twitter.com/wfahd1000/status/1255617464609669121</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Photos: </span><span>Despite </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hashtag_click">#COVID19</a></span><span>, we continue to deliver. </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/UNDPYemen">@UNDPYemen</a></span><span> completed the rehabilitation of the training facility in </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hodeidah?src=hashtag_click">#Hodeidah</a></span><span> port.

Spotting something, he dismounts and spends several minutes disentangling a mass of discarded chain-link fencing from blocks of concrete, before loading it into the large basket suspended above his two front wheels.</p><p>After spending 12 hours collecting metal and plastic waste, Said delivers his hauls to recycling industry wholesalers in the city in exchange for the equivalent of around US$4 each day.</p><p>It may seem a small sum for the time and effort involved, but having been forced to abandon his former business and displaced from his home due to Yemen’s five-year conflict, the money he earns makes all the difference to Said and his family.</p><p>“I lost everything when the fighting broke out. The war took everything,” explained Said, who fled with his wife and seven children from their home in Al Hudaydah on the country’s west coast in 2018 after a wave of violence swept the area.</p><p>They went from living a comfortable life supported by Said’s successful business making and selling traditional ornate floor cushions known as madkha, to fleeing with nothing to join the estimated 3.65 million Yemenis displaced by the long-running conflict.</p><p>“We first went to Sana’a, but after spending some time there, life was hard. I could not find support or a job,” Said said. At the end of last year, the family made their way to the southern port city of Aden, where they found space in a collective shelter living alongside 135 other families displaced from various parts of the country.</p><p>On arrival, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and its partners provided them with essentials including a tent and mattresses. But with no means of earning an income, it was a struggle for Said just to keep his family fed, so he began collecting waste metal and plastic by hand simply to survive.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/2020/4/5e986b954/help-arrives-three-wheels-displaced-yemeni-recyclers.html">https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/2020/4/5e986b954/help-arrives-three-wheels-displaced-yemeni-recyclers.html</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>WFP Yemen Country Brief, March 2020</p><p>In Numbers</p><p>12 million people assisted so far in March 2020 (distributions are ongoing)</p><p>120,300 mt of general food assistance dispatched</p><p>USD 6.3 million cash-based transfers made USD 18.5 million value of redeemed commodities through food vouchers</p><p>USD 625 million six-month net funding requirements (April – September 2020)</p><p>Operational Updates</p><p>WFP has activated an alternate work arrangement in all WFP offices in Yemen as a precautionary measure against COVID-19 with exceptions necessary for operational continuity.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/wfp-yemen-country-brief-march-2020">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/wfp-yemen-country-brief-march-2020</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp4 Flüchtlinge / Refugees</span></h2><p><span>(B H P)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span>As part of his humanitarian endeavors, the UAE Red Crescent distributes fasting Iftar meals in Al-Hima camp, Al-Tahita</p><p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqHXetDz5UA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqHXetDz5UA</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>ACTED supports flood hit communities in Aden and Al Dhale’e</p><p>At the end of March, followed by months of drought, Yemen’s seasonal rains arrived. By this time, the dry, compacted soils had lost much of their ability to absorb water leading to widespread flash floods. Rivers soon burst their banks, inundating the streets in urban areas and sweeping away trees and cars.</p><p>The floods lefts thousands of families destitute with no assets or income to support their recovery. ACTED was the first agency to provide support to displaced families living in 30 settlements affected by the flooding.</p><p>The regions of Aden and Al Dhale’e are home to 55 IDP settlements, 30 of which ACTED has played a key role in managing since 2019. The majority of the 3,000 families living in these settlements are women with their children for whom ACTED is responsible for ensuring humane living conditions that include access to basic services and commodities.</p><p>Following the initial floods, ACTED visited a number of the settlements to assess the level of damage to shelters and other assets. It was clear that hundreds of families had lost their shelters and food stocks as a result of the rain water. Latrines were overflowing, creating significant hygiene and sanitation risks, especially for young children and vulnerable adults.</p><p>Coordinating the response</p><p>ACTED quickly coordinated with UNHCR and WFP for the distribution of additional soap and buckets, cleaning material for the shelters and food commodities such as flour and rice that the families had lost. ACTED also coordinated with WASH partners to travel to the flooded sites, pump the water from the ground and empty flooded latrine pits in order to decrease the sanitation risks for the population.</p><p>Responding immediately to the most urgent needs</p><p>Coordination with other actors led to the realization that responders lacked the necessary quantity of shelter materials due to oversight vis-a-vis the prepositioning of such key items to allow for an immediate response in the case of a sudden onset crisis such as flooding. ACTED therefore commenced a distribution of shelter materials to around 200 households to repair their homes that had been destroyed or damaged by the rains.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.acted.org/en/acted-supports-flood-hit-communities-in-aden-and-al-dhalee/">https://www.acted.org/en/acted-supports-flood-hit-communities-in-aden-and-al-dhalee/</a></span></p><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p><span>More than 3,200 households flee from Hebshi mountain in </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Taiz?src=hashtag_click">#Taiz</a></span><span> governorate as a result of the ongoing conflict</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1255140186112942080">https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1255140186112942080</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span>Vereinten Nationen geht Geld für Jemen-Hilfe aus</span></p><p><span>Im Jemen droht den Vereinten Nationen das Geld für die Versorgung von nahezu einer Million Menschen auf der Flucht auszugehen.

They already face abject poverty and hardship, and urgent funding is needed in the coming weeks to keep the lifesaving aid programmes running.</p><p>It is estimated that more than 3.6 million people have been forced to flee their homes in Yemen since the start of the latest conflict in 2015. Only Syria, Colombia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have larger internal displacement driven by conflict. The annual report on global internal displacement issued today by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) estimates that conflict and violence displaced nearly 400,000 people in 2019 alone.</p><p>UNHCR is urgently seeking US$89.4 million to secure life-saving protection and assistance to internally displaced families, refugees, and asylum-seekers and their hosting communities.</p><p>With most of the country struggling to survive as the conflict in Yemen enters its sixth year, this funding will enable UNHCR to maintain life-saving aid to internally displaced families, refugees, asylum-seekers and the equally impoverished Yemenis hosting them. This aid is now urgent, as these groups are the most vulnerable to the threat of COVID-19, which may have severe consequences if aid agencies are unable to deliver proper support.</p><p>Without the required funds, several of UNHCR’s critical programs and assistance, such as direct cash support, are at risk of drastic reduction or may cease. This will leave 655,000 internally displaced people, and a refugee and asylum-seeking population in Yemen comprising some 281,000 men, women and children in dire need. They will be without proper means to get food for their families or medicine for their sick children, unable to find shelter, or to keep themselves warm, forcing some to live in the open during this rainy season. For many refugees and displaced families, this is a matter of life and death.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2020/4/5ea7ecd84/unhcr-shortfall-threatens-critical-aid-nearly-million-displaced-yemenis.html">https://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2020/4/5ea7ecd84/unhcr-shortfall-threatens-critical-aid-nearly-million-displaced-yemenis.html</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fortsetzung / Sequel: cp5 – cp18</span></h2><p><strong><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-647b-yemen-war-mosaic-647b">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-647b-yemen-war-mosaic-647b</a> </strong></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vorige / Previous:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-646-yemen-war-mosaic-646">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-646-yemen-war-mosaic-646</a> </p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 1-646 / Yemen War Mosaic 1-646:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose</a> oder / or <a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Der saudische Luftkrieg im Bild / Saudi aerial war images:</span></h2><p><span>(18 +, Nichts für Sensible!) / (18 +; Graphic!)</span></p><p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/">http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://www.yemenwar.info/">http://www.yemenwar.info/</a> </span></p><p>Liste aller Luftangriffe / and list of all air raids:</p><p><span><a href="http://yemendataproject.org/data/">http://yemendataproject.org/data/</a></span></p><p>Untersuchung ausgewählter Luftangriffe durch Bellingcat / Bellingcat investigations of selected air raids:</p><p><span><a href="https://yemen.bellingcat.com/">https://yemen.bellingcat.com/</a></span></p><p><span>Untersuchungen von Angriffen, hunderte von Filmen / Investigations of attacks, hundreds of films:</span></p><p><span><a href="https://yemeniarchive.org/en">https://yemeniarchive.org/en</a></span></p></div>

          Yuval Harari ist einer der erfolgreichsten Sachbuchautoren der Welt. Von der „Kurzen Geschichte der Menschheit“ wurden in Deutschland über eine Millionen Exemplare verkauft.
