The agreement ignored the issue of the detainees and forcibly disappeared persons in the south, the organisation said.<br />It held Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates responsible for the issue of the detainees because the two countries are running all southern regions and have influence on the warring factions there. The two countries have been leading an Arab military coalition in Yemen since March 2015.<br />CEO of the organisation, Tawfik Al-Hamidi, said: "The organisation has received many reports from families of arbitrarily detained persons saying the management of the Bir Ahmed Jail in Aden has been denying family visits to detainees for three months. Jail officers are also ignoring judicial orders to release some detainees and orders regarding improving health conditions of detainees inside the jail".</p><p><span><a href="https://debriefer.net/en/news-18328.html">https://debriefer.net/en/news-18328.html</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Senior advisor to exiled former Yemeni president Hadi expelled from Saudi Arabia</p><p>Abdulaziz al-Jubari reportedly punished for opposing Saudi-Emirati plan to include Southern Transitional Council separatists in Hadi government</p><p>The Saudi authorities have expelled Abdulaziz al-Jubari, an advisor to the exiled former president of Yemen Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi who was based in Riyadh, after he made statements rejecting the negotiations on the formation of a new Yemeni puppet government consisting of both Hadi loyalists and the separatist Southern Transitional Council.</p><p>According to informed sources, the Saudi authorities expelled al-Jubari from its territory.

Even though the UN’s compliance with Saudi bullying prevents a peaceful settlement to Yemen’s war.</p><p>At a time when Yemen needs the world’s support more than ever, as it grapples with a vast coronavirus spread and other humanitarian problems, the United Nations once again failed to deliver. On June 15, it dropped the Saudi-led coalition forces from a blacklist of warring parties that have killed children.</p><p>Since March 2015, and throughout its war on Yemen, Saudi Arabia has indeed killed civilians and children</p><p>The UN until recently recognized that Saudi Arabia had killed children in Yemen</p><p>“The secretary-general has brought shame on the UN by removing the Saudi-led coalition from his ‘list of shame’ even as it continues to kill and injure children in Yemen,” said <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/jo-becker">Jo Becker</a></span>, Children’s Rights Advocacy Director at Human Rights Watch.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has long flexed its financial muscles to pressure the United Nations into clearing its name, while seeking to sway it in favor of its own regional narratives, such as condemning Iran.</p><p>In 2016, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon raised the alarm about Saudi pressure</p><p>“Bullying, threats, pressure,” a diplomatic source told Reuters on condition of anonymity about the reaction to the blacklisting, adding that it was “real blackmail.” Some of Saudi Arabia’s allies, including the United Arab Emirates, also threatened to cut funding to various UN institutions, including the UNRWA – the aid charity for Palestinians, and other bodies.</p><p>Clerics in Riyadh also threatened to put out a fatwa against the UN “declaring it anti-Muslim, which would mean no contacts of [the Organization of Islamic Cooperation] members, no relations, contributions, support, to any UN projects, programs,” according to the diplomatic source.</p><p>Though the UN <span><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200616-saudi-led-yemen-coalition-pulled-from-un-blacklist-of-warring-parties-killing-children">claimed</a></span> it came “under no pressure” from Saudi Arabia to change its latest listing, and that this move was based on data, this should raise suspicions considering Riyadh’s past bullying, while it has still killed children throughout this period.</p><p>In any case, the UN’s reticence to appropriately “name and shame” Saudi Arabia prevents a peaceful solution to the conflict, as it is still a key player in the war and controls Hadi’s government.</p><p>The UN’s own peace initiatives show this reality. Its peace talks in Stockholm in December 2018, seeking to find common ground between the Hadi government and the Houthis, failed to criticize Saudi Arabia’s role in the war. The refusal to hold Saudi Arabia to account meant it could continue stoking the war from outside, while further antagonizing the Houthis, rendering these peace initiatives redundant.

Each party blames Griffiths of ignoring the other party's actions and failing to convey the mere reality in Yemen, making the confidence shaky between the warring parties and the UN official.<br />"Griffiths is now trying to clear his name. Instead of reaching a solution to a war that triggered what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis, the UN envoy is trying to convince its two parties that he is acting neutrally in Yemen and that he and his team are continually devoted to hardworking in order to reach a solution for the hard crisis experienced by the country," the AA concluded.</p><p><span><a href="https://debriefer.net/en/news-18285.html">https://debriefer.net/en/news-18285.html</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp8 Saudi-Arabien / Saudi Arabia</span></h2><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>Saudi failed to arrest its black box refuged in Canada</p><p>Three years ago, one of the cleverest Saudi intelligence officers fled the kingdom's lands without felt by authorities and settled in Canada.

CAAT is considering further legal steps.</p><p>n June 2019, the Court of Appeal ruled that the Government acted unlawfully when it licensed the sale of UK-made arms to Saudi forces for use in Yemen without making an assessment as to whether or not past incidents amounted to breaches of International Humanitarian Law. The Government was ordered not to approve any new licences and to retake the decisions on extant licences in a lawful manner. This ruling did not stop arms from being transferred under extant licences. In the aftermath of the Court ruling, the Government has admitted <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/truss-admits-uk-breached-court-order-banning-arm-sales-to-saudis-again">multiple breaches</a></span> of the ban on new licences.</p><p>Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said:</p><p>This is a disgraceful and morally bankrupt decision.

We will be considering this new decision with our lawyers, and will be exploring all options available to challenge it.</p><p>The evidence shows a clear pattern of heinous and appalling breaches of International humanitarian law by a coalition which has repeatedly targeted civilian gatherings such as weddings, funerals, and market places. The government claims that these are isolated incidents, but how many hundreds of isolated incidents would it take for the Government to stop supplying the weaponry?</p><p>This exposes the rank hypocrisy at the heart of UK foreign policy.

While the outcomes in Syria and Libya are not yet clear as Damascus finalizes the consolidation of territorial control over the country, Russia has the advantage in Syria of being allied with President Assad’s forces and, despite their differences, Iran. It’s anyone’s guess what would happen if Yemen were to follow the same trajectory.</span></p><p><span>And while Ankara has been asking for financial support from various countries, it is too early to rule out the possibility that it will invest financing it does not yet have in another conflict. Turkey can likely rely on its funder Qatar’s willingness to fuel the fires wherever possible and embroil its regional adversaries in endless asymmetrical and media wars.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, there is evidence pointing to an aggressive approach by Turkey to involvement in Yemen. So far, its activities are more in line with Turkey’s previous soft-power approach to relationship management than with the impulsive, scandalous, and bellicose activities that have backfired on Erdogan in Syria, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Libya.</span></p><p><span>In Yemen, Turkey’s presence is focused on the three coastal areas. The strategic chokepoints of Bab Al-Mandeb and the Gulf of Aden remain the coveted prizes that multiple countries, including Iran and Russia, have an eye on. Turkey has been trying to maneuver among the parties involved in the multiple conflicts brewing in Yemen, and is possibly courting the internationally recognized Hadi government for approval and support.</span></p><p><span>Still, Turkey’s current maneuvers around Shabwa, Socotra, and Mukha in Taiz are bound to raise eyebrows.</span></p><p>However, Qatari media and lobbies have mobilized Islamist-leaning locals against UAE-backed separatists and others more sympathetic to the goals of the Arab Coalition, and those are the elements to which Turkey speaks. As it did in its approach to Africa and the Indian subcontinent, Turkey has invested heavily in humanitarian outreach to its potential Yemeni supporters via the Turkish Humanitarian Relief Organization (IHH). The IHH has been active in the area (Shabwa) ever since it fell largely under the control of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2019. The idea is to spread Islamist control through the Alam region in southwest Yemen, where Islamist tribes and militias are increasingly pushing back against the Arab Coalition.</p><p>This pushback included a series of mortar attacks aimed at food and medical supply lines that forced Coalition forces to retreat. </p><p><span>While Erdogan is exploiting political tensions, he is known to be courting Socotra Governor Ramzi Mahrous, who is reported to have met with Turkish and Qatari intelligence in Istanbul. Turkey is also using al-Islah to infiltrate the education system, religious institutions, and other social infrastructure in Yemen, using Qatari textbooks and Turkish expertise in ideological influence to radicalize the local population.</span></p><p><span>And what about Russia?</span></p><p><span>While Moscow is not openly choosing sides between Hadi/Coalition forces and the Houthis or even al-Islah, it remains in dialogue with all parties without antagonizing any group through militant interference. For Russia, the outcome in Yemen is less important than its ability to advance its agenda</span></p><p><span>In theory, so long as Turkey respects these boundaries and has no conflict with Russia over its interests, the two countries can pursue their goals side by side, especially as there is no clear winner right now. However, should Turkey advance more aggressively to impose Islamist control and intervene militarily, and should it attempt to oust Russia from a leading or influential role in Yemen due to a clash of interests or in response to the non-resolution of tensions in Syria or Libya, another proxy conflict could occur – by Irina Tsukerman</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/07/08/is-yemen-the-next-frontier-of-a-turkey-russia-conflict/">https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/07/08/is-yemen-the-next-frontier-of-a-turkey-russia-conflict/</a></span></p><p>My comment: From an Israeli news site.

It is the case of Eritrea, and the search for a regional role in the Red Sea region and Bab al-Mandab under the umbrella of Israeli interests, with its strategic relations with most of the countries of the region and the veto states.</p><p>Eritrea is unique from the rest of the Horn of Africa by its supervision of the Bab al-Mandab Strait, its vast maritime borders with Yemen and Saudi Arabia, and its close proximity to Yemeni ports on the Red Sea</p><p>The storm alliance would not have made such a sudden shift towards Asmara if there had been no direction from Washington, a green light and a prelude from Tel Aviv, especially after the transfer of the compass of Arab and Gulf hostility specifically from Israel to Iran, in parallel with growing U.S.-Zionist concerns about the growing Iranian influence in Eritrea, the Horn of Africa and Africa in general, despite Asmara's denial of any Iranian presence in its territory, and its continued assertion that what they have is merely normal routine relations, but these assertions have not convinced Tel Aviv and Washington.

terrorists from Syria to Yemen from the Turkish-backed factions for $5,000 per a single terrorist.<br />The beginning of the Turkish eyes orientation towards Yemen was at the end of 2018 when Erdogan stated that he did not see the policies of the two Gulf states, namely Saudi Arabia and the UAE in Yemen are correct.<br />Then, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu commented that his country will not remain silent and will not let people die in Yemen according to Turkish Anatolia Agency.<br />Turkey started the incursion into Yemen through the Rally and Reform Party, one of the arms of the international organization of the Brotherhood, while Ahmed al-Mismari, a spokesman for the Libyan National Army, told a news conference in March 2020 that Turkey was trying to control the Mediterranean and find a port on the Red Sea to threaten Europe and international navigation, and that it supported the Brotherhood through mercenaries from Syria with five thousand dollars and gave them 850 Turkish liras upon their arrival in Turkey.<br /><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/23496">http://en.adenpress.news/news/23496</a></span></p><p>My comment: And again, from a

US engagement in Yemen consists mostly of logistical and intelligence assistance to the Arab Coalition, and a fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda.</p><p>If US bases in Yemen are attacked by Houthis, that would not make the news coverage or the public briefings. Part of the reason US had worked to minimize the appearance of Houthis’ potential threat to US security interest is the preservation of the delicate balance between being involved just enough to keep a modicum of stability in the war-torn country, keeping stable the relationship with US allies, and at the same time avoiding accusations of being drawn in into another long term conflict that may end with a physical escalation and confrontation with Iranian forces. There is increasing evidence that the purpose of the Houthis is global, rather than local or regional nuisance aimed at the Saudis. Houthis are modeled after Hezbullah, which itself started as a local Lebanese militia aimed at ousting Israel, but grew into a quasi-formal military structure that now controls the Lebanese Parliament, as well as has taken advantage of the country’s tribal structure to ensure local support.</p><p>The Houthis are being molded into the same type of faction, with global presence and a level of resourcefulness which far exceeds their initial purpose in toppling the Yemen government, destabilizing the country, and miring Saudi Arabia in a seemingly unwinnable asymmetrical contact. Having expressed threats in the general direction of UAE, Israel, and having spread anti-American propaganda, Houthis are becoming effective counterparts to Iraqi militias and other Iranian foreign legions, and with time, may become part of a more integrated network of well disciplined ideologically loyal forces that are alotted a portion of control over local territories in exchange for their availability to strike at Iran’s favored target anytime anyplace and give Iranian propagandists and lobbyists in the West a cover of plausible deniability to keep pushing deals with Tehran and to help the Islamic Republic avoid accountability in the form of sanctions snapbacks and arms embargoes – by Irina Tsukerman</p><p><span><a href="https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2020/07/08/conflict-in-yemen-is-a-global-threat-and-irans-trump-card/">https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2020/07/08/conflict-in-yemen-is-a-global-threat-and-irans-trump-card/</a></span></p><p>My comment: The very old well-known US hawkish propaganda BS.

of a restaurant in (Zabid) directorate of (Al-Hodeidah) governorate.</p><p>JIAT found that on the claim date (03/01/2018), the Coalition Forces did not carry out any aerial missions in (Zabid) directorate of (Al-Hodeidah) governorate, and that the nearest military target that was targeted by the Coalition Forces on the date of the claim is located in (Al-Khokhah) directorate of (Al-Hodeidah) governorate, about (41) km away from the (Zabid) directorate.</p><p>In light of that, JIAT found that Coalition Forces did not target (a military vehicle) parked in front of (a restaurant) on (03/01/2018) in (Zabid) directorate of (Al-Hodeidah) governorate as claimed.<br />A statement issued by the Joint Incident Assessment Team (JIAT) regarding the claim that the Coalition Forces targeted the (Mothalath Ahim) market in (Hajjah) Governorate on (04/07/2015)</p><p>Human Rights Watch report issued in (November 2015), that at (22:00) on (04/07/2015) the Coalition Forces bombed (Mothalath Ahim) market, the air strike destroyed at least (6) buildings, including a 4-storey building, which contains Sanaa restaurant, a store, a hotel, a water truck, and a car in front of the building, Human Rights Watch visited the site on (24/07/2015), and spoke with a number of eyewitnesses, one of whom reported that a few hours ago an air strike hit a gas station, and an hour later an air strike hit a football field, and at the same time a strike hit an vacant building (2) km away, the airstrike on (Mothalath Ahim) resulted in the death of (65) civilians and wounded of (105), attached to the report is a statement of names and ages, of (17) dead and (2) wounded.<br />2. The statement issued by the Doctors Without Borders organization (MSF) on (07/07/2015), which states that a series of air strikes targeted a crowded market on Saturday evening (04/07/2015), the attack killed (20) people, (9) bodies were recovered the next day from under the rubble, and the attack on the market called (Mothalath Ahim) began at about (8:30) when an air strike hit a gas station, half an hour later another attack targeted the heart of the crowded market and hit two restaurants and a hotel.<br />3. The report of the (Belling Cat) website issued on (24/04/2019) that on (04/07/2015) an air strike occurred in the center of (Mothalath Ahim) near restaurants and a water truck, and open sources videos indicate a number of civilian casualties.</p><p>JIAT found that the claimed site (Mothalath Ahim) is located (16) km from the international borders of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and at the time of the military operation was under the control of Al-Houthi armed militia and the former President's forces, and it became a center used by Al-Houthi armed militia and the former president forces to reinforce their forces, in preparation for the implementation of the operation to invade the international borders of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, civilians have been displaced from the claimed area to other regions due to the intensity of military operations in and out of the site.<br />(intelligence reports, monitoring and reconnaissance) stated the storage of (a ballistic missile inside a hangar) in a semi-isolated location, (gatherings of Al-Houthi armed militia and the former President's forces, and military vehicles) are at the claimed site (Mothalath Ahim), which is considered to be a legitimate military target, based on Article (52), Paragraph (2) of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions.</p><p>The availability of degrees of verification (monitoring, surveillance, and reconnaissance) confirmed the presence of a ballistic missile in (a hangar), and radar transmissions of (SAM2) and (SAM3) missiles were observed near the targeted site, and gatherings and vehicles belonging to Al-Houthi armed militia and elements of the former President's forces, for the purpose of effective participation in military actions, based on rule No. (16) of the customary International Humanitarian Law.</p><p>The legal protection of the civilian objects (a hangar containing a ballistic missile) was lost, and it became a legitimate military target for the use of it by Al-Houthi armed militia and the former President's forces, for the purpose of effectively contributing to military actions to support the war effort based on Article (52) of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions.<br />On Saturday, (04/07/2015) at (8:45) pm, Coalition Forces targeted (a ballistic missile inside a hangar) using one guided bomb that hit its target. the Coalition Forces also at (9:40) pm on the same day, targeted (gatherings of elements of Al-Houthi armed militia, elements of the former President's forces, and military vehicles) on a specific location, using one guided bomb that hit its target.<br />The Coalition Forces have taken all feasible precautions by studying and defining the target's environment.</p><p>In light of that, JIAT found that the procedures taken by Coalition Forces, in dealing with the legitimate military target (a ballistic missile inside a hangar), and (a gathering of elements from Al-Houthi armed militia, elements of the former president's forces, and military vehicles) were correct and in accordance with the International Humanitarian Law and its customary rules<br />JIAT sees that it is appropriate for the Coalition States to provide assistance for collateral damage the building which is located across the road west of the military target (a gathering of elements from Al-Houthi armed militia, elements of the former president's forces, and military vehicles), as well as for the damage to the water truck that was not within the circle of collateral damage before and during the initial phase of targeting, and was affected due to suddenly entering the vicinity of the military target.</p><p>With regard to what was stated in the statement of the United Nations Resident Coordinator and the Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen on (11 March 2019), regarding attacks on homes in the (Kushar) directorate that killed (22) people, including (12) children and 10 women, during the previous two days (09-10/03/2019), and what was stated in the seventh report of National Committee to investigate allegations of human rights violations in Yemen for the period from (01/02/2019) to (31/07/2019) that at (5:30) pm on (10/03/2019) A house belonging to the (B.H.) family was bombed in (Talan Village) in the (Kushar) directorate with a missile, killing (10) people and wounding (12) others, the attack also caused terror among the residents and some of them left their homes to the mountain, among the escaping families (A.Z.), which resulted in targeting them with another missile, causing the death of (11) and wounding (6) women and children.</p><p>JIAT found that on Saturday (09/03/2019), Al-Houthi armed militia stormed (Jabal Talan) in (Kushar) directorate, and deployed their fighters to control it, and was in direct clashes with the tribes that are loyal to the legitimate government and are supported by the Coalition Forces directly by air support, one of the Coalition Forces units detected a vehicle carrying Al-Houthi armed militia fighters through the reconnaissance system, that was also confirmed by the ground elements, where they got out of that vehicle and entered a building in (Jabal Talan), which is considered to be a legitimate military target that the destruction of it would achieve a military advantage based on Article (52), paragraph (2) of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, and rule No. (8) of the customary International Humanitarian Law.<br />The availability of degrees of verification through the ground sources of the legitimate forces that (the building) contains elements of Al-Houthi armed militia in (Jabal Talan) in (Kushar) directorate of (Hajjah) governorate, based on the rule No. (16) of the customary international humanitarian law.<br />The legal protection for civilian objects (the building) lost due to its use by Al-Houthi armed militia effectively to support the military actions, in accordance with Article (52), of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions.<br />Accordingly, at (10:30) pm Saturday (09/03/2019), the Coalition Forces, at the request of the Yemeni legitimate forces, carried out a mission (air support) on a target consisting of (a building in which members of Al-Houthi armed militia were present) in (Jabal Talan) in (Kushar) directorate of (Hajjah) governorate, using one guided bomb that hit its target.</p><p>In light of that, JIAT found that the procedures taken by Coalition Forces, in dealing with the legitimate military target (building contains Al-Houthi armed militia fighters) in (Jabal Talan) in (Kosher) directorate of (Hajjah) governorate, were correct and in accordance with the International Humanitarian Law and its customary rules.<br />A statement issued by the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) regarding the claim that (a house) was targeted in (Midi) directorate of (Hajjah) governorate on (22/04/2018)<br />With regard to what was stated in the note issued on (24/04/2018) by the spokesperson of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to Yemen, that an air strike was launched by the Coalition Forces around (2:00) pm on Sunday (22/04/2018), in the (Midi) directorate of (Hajjah) governorate, they hit a civilian house, killing all five members of the family, including three children and a woman, our staff members were told that the victims were having lunch inside their house when a missile landed directly on the house in an area called (Al-Haddouriya), family neighbours told UN human rights staff that they had seen fighter planes in the area just before the accident.</p><p>JIAT found that the Coalition Forces observed (gatherings of Al-Houthi armed militia elements, and a ballistic missile launcher) in the area of ??operations, hidden in an isolated area and free of buildings and civilian objects in (Midi) directorate of (Hajjah) governorate, therefore, the Coalition Forces carried out an air mission on two targets at (2:02) pm on Sunday (22/04/2018), which consists of (a ballistic missile launcher, and gatherings of Al-Houthi armed militia elements) in (Midi) directorate of (Hajjah) governorate, which is considered to be a legitimate military target that the destruction of it would achieve a military advantage based on Article (52), paragraph (2) of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, and rule No. (8) of the customary International Humanitarian Law.<br />The availability of degrees of verification through monitoring operations, which confirmed the presence of a (ballistic missile launcher, and gatherings of Al-Houthi armed militia elements) in (Midi) directorate of (Hajjah) governorate, based on rule No. (16) of the customary International Humanitarian Law.<br />The Coalition Forces used two guided bombs that commensurate with the size and type of the target, and took all feasible precautions to avoid accidental loss of or damage to civilian objects, or to reduce them in any event to a minimum, by ensuring that no civilian objects and civilian personnel were present at the targeted site before and during targeting.</p><p>In light of that, JIAT found that Coalition Forces did not target a civilian (house) in (Midi) directorate of (Hajjah) governorate as claimed, and that the procedures taken by Coalition Forces, in dealing with the legitimate military target (a ballistic missile launcher) and (gatherings of Al-Houthi armed militia elements) were correct and in accordance with the International Humanitarian Law and its customary rules.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=2107964">https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=2107964</a></span></p><p><span><a

remarks and comment: This Saudi coalition “Joint Incidents Assessment Team” (JIAT) neither is “independent”, nor it is a team to investigate the Saudi coalition air raids – it’s nothing more than a scam to pretend that the coalition is caring for human rights. The only function is whitewashing Saudi coalition war crimes and giving the international public a pretense to continue arms sales and further support. The methods used are: Simply denial; claiming that there had been any “military target” at the site; claiming that there had been “Houthis” at the site. Also just keep in mind that in this war, there could not exist any “legitimate” military targets, as it’s a war of aggression, what excludes the possibility that that any target – whatever it actually is – could be a “legitimate” military target.</p><p><strong>Zabid, Al Hodeida, Jan. 3, 2018:</strong></p><p><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news483749.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news483749.htm</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news483782.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news483782.htm</a></span></p><p>Photos: Most of them are more available, saved by me</p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/narrabyee/status/949147160351657985">https://twitter.com/narrabyee/status/949147160351657985</a></span></p><p>Film: Deleted by facebook, thus covering war crimes, making clear that Facebook is taking sides with war criminals (films had been saved by me)</p><p><strong>Mothalath Ahim market, Hajjah: July 4, 2015:</strong></p><p><span>Photos: <a href="http://poorworld.net/Yemen/YemenImages105.htm">http://poorworld.net/Yemen/YemenImages105.htm</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/Yemen/YemenImages106.htm">http://poorworld.net/Yemen/YemenImages106.htm</a></span></p><p>Report: <a href="http://www.sabanews.net/ar/news399111.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/ar/news399111.htm</a></p><p>Film: <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTPWlg1vNHk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTPWlg1vNHk</a></span></p><p>Bellingcat report: <span><a href="https://yemen.bellingcat.com/investigations/the-yemen-project-haj10003-aahim-triangle-bani-hassan-hajjah">https://yemen.bellingcat.com/investigations/the-yemen-project-haj10003-aahim-triangle-bani-hassan-hajjah</a></span>, concluding: From the open sources available it is clear that on the night of 2015-07-04 a munition, most likely air-dropped, detonated in the middle of Muthalith Aahim, close to restaurants and a water truck.
