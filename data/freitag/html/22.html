It's not hard to see why this man has been called the 'hero' of Yemen.</p><p>Starting with distributing 32 food baskets in May 2015, an almost-accidental incident Al-Rodaini came across while reporting on coalition attacks, the organisation quickly expanded its work to include water security and sanitisation, education resources, health and shelter assistance, while maintaining large-scale food security initiatives, becoming one of the few local, independent organisations delivering life-saving aid.</p><p>We spoke to Al-Rodani to learn about his relentless work, the unimaginable dangers he and his team have endured, and how you can help.</p><p>FAR: Originally, I’m a journalist. I hadn’t worked in humanitarian aid at all before, but in 2015, the situation became terrifying, it was disturbing. It was catastrophic around us. People were starting to be displaced from their homes, and it was tough to see that there were no international organisations working in this field at the time. So it was an initiative I started with the initial team to create something here, for the people.</p><p>I was reporting live on the airstrikes that the coalition was carrying out on Yemen. In May, the province of Amanat Al Asimah was targeted with internationally-banned <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/world/middleeast/saudi-led-group-said-to-use-cluster-bombs-in-yemen.html">cluster</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/yemen-brazilian-cluster-munitions-suspected-in-saudi-arabia-led-coalition-attack/">bombs</a></span>, which led to the displacement of a large number of families. On the 23<sup>rd</sup> of May, 2015, we had our first distribution, 32 food baskets of diversified foodstuff for displaced families.</p><p>Since 2015 until today, we have worked in more than 12 provinces in Yemen, distributed more than 50,000 food baskets to displaced and vulnerable families, orphans, and widows, more than 8,000 school bags, 20,000 pieces of clothing, and 15,000 blankets and other shelter materi</p><p>In March, we began focusing on water as well, and now we supply more than 30,000 litres of potable water per day. We’ve also supported families with direct cash transfers. We may have started with 32 food baskets, but we didn’t stop at food security.</p><p>In total, we have delivered aid to the value of $500,000, distributed in more than 12 provinces. Our office is in the capital, Sanaa, but due to the circumstances of war, we try to meet the immediate needs of people throughout Yemen.</p><p>It's happened several times that we were working directly under airstrikes, and every time it feels like a miracle to survive.</p><p>I’m a journalist just like you. So writing is my passion. When you see what people are going through, something inside compels you to report it. The media, western or otherwise, doesn't talk about the reality of life in Yemen. There’s a huge gap between the real situation, and the silence of the media.</p><p>My work is not just about delivering aid somewhere and that’s it. In our visits to different areas, we try reflect the situation on the ground. In 2016, we reported to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Yemen that there are cases of severe malnutrition in Al Hudaydah. We were the first in April 2016 to report on the malnutrition in Hajjah.</p><p>It has never been about just delivering aid, but also doing field visits to accurately inform, and produce news reports about the families most harmed by the war.</p><p>In terms of our work, we want to show donors where their funds are going. Our reporting on social media only reflects a fraction of our work, but at the end of the day, it matters. People know their money is going where it should. Documenting is incredibly important to ensure our work is sustainable, and that we’re accountable to the highest standards of what’s expected of us.</p><p>We rely on our survey and mapping mechanisms, that show us where the most immediate needs are. And the priorities go to the most vulnerable communities, those who do not even ask for assistance. These families in desperate need are our priority.</p><p>Q: Can you tell me about the situation in Al Hudaydah, which has been reported as one of the most affected areas of Yemen currently?</p><p>FAR: The situation is catastrophic. Before, when we would visit from Sanaa, it would take us 6 hours. Al Hudaydah has a central supply route, the entrance to the province, called Kilo 16 that leads to Sanaa and other places. The distance from the main area to Al Hudaydah is maybe 10-15 minutes. Now, you need more than 5 hours to get in or out.</p><p>The situation is dire, a humanitarian crisis to tragic degrees. In Al Hudaydah, there are so many people whose lives have been completely destroyed. They depend mainly on daily wages, and this war has led to mass displacement, not just in Al Hudaydah’s urban centres, but also surrounding villages. </p><p>Q: There’s also a revolving-door element to the coverage of Yemen, as it rises periodically in media coverage. Even the fact that I’m speaking to you now, when your work has been ongoing for five years, do you meet that with disappointment? </p><p>FAR: In Yemen, the topics that get attention are only ever the timely, immediate coverage issues, and even those are heavily manipulated. International organisations, for example, all direct their attention right now to malnutrition. And in a while, interest wanes, and attention goes somewhere else, to the cholera outbreak for example.</p><p>It’s as if these organisations are the ones leading both crisis and response. They dictate ‘we must speak about this now, it’s important now, that other topic isn’t urgent at the moment.’ And so it’s like there’s a swell of interest every once in a while, and then it disappears. And it’s international organisations and the UN in Yemen that really lead this.</p><p>And the international media has not done right by Yemen. And that has had a grave impact on the situation in Yemen, and the continuation of the war.</p><p>Q: What’s the link that you see between media silence and continued war?</p><p>FAR: Every day, we hear of huge massacres. Every day, we see mass violations of the rights of the child. So the link is that—the media is silent. If it had shed light on the air raids that take place, or food security, or diseases, we would have seen timely solutions.</p><p>If the media really looked at what happened, the international community could no longer turn its back. But as long as the media is silent, the situation continues.</p><p>And the Arab world truly just does not know. It’s a purely political problem to them, and we as a people have become party to a conflict we never chose. The injustice that the people of Yemen have been dealt is appalling. </p><p>The sheer scale of disease transmission, of hunger, of the lack of clean water—they’re problems Arabs do not know. Because they aren’t living it, but we are. We live this reality, every day.</p><p>Q: Can you tell me about your funding? How accessible are funds currently?</p><p>FAR: It’s difficult to access funds of any kind right now. The sanctions on Yemen have also adversely affected humanitarian work. As Mona Relief, we have no ties with UN organisations or international organisations currently operating in Yemen. All our sources of funding depend on either local private donors, regional private donors, or some international organisations operating outside of Yemen.</p><p>It’s very hard right now. You might have noticed <span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/monarelief">our Patreon campaign</a></span>, and we’re seeing a lot of people donate, and we’re being tweeted by people with millions of followers. People are seeing that we <em>are</em> in the field, we’re providing support. Thank God, over the past few years, we’ve built a solid reputation as an organisation. Over the past five years, we’ve provided immense support, with completely independent, humble efforts. </p><p>Of course, we’re facing issues in accessing funds. We’re struggling with people who want to send foodstuff from abroad, so we can’t access it easily through the Port of Aden. Right now, we’re trying to work through this obstacle with the Yemeni authorities (photos)</p><p><span><a href="https://scenearabia.com/Life/Frontlines-of-Famine-An-Interview-with-Yemen-s-Humanitarian-Hero-Mona-Relief-Fatik-Al-Rodani">https://scenearabia.com/Life/Frontlines-of-Famine-An-Interview-with-Yemen-s-Humanitarian-Hero-Mona-Relief-Fatik-Al-Rodani</a></span></p><p><span>MONA Relief: </span><span>I have just finished distributing 200 food aid baskets in Sana'a governorate based on a fund by our Partners Relief and Development and carried out by </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/monarelief">@monarelief</a></span><span> We are arranging for another distribution in the end of this week inshallah.

Over coffee, he surveys the latest news and answers questions about the coronavirus pandemic back home in Yemen, posting responses to more than 156,000 followers. Then, after a 10-hour shift at the Catholic Clinic in the western German city of Essen, he logs back in until midnight.</p><p>“My aim is to warn our society about this pandemic and show them how to defend themselves against it. Because, believe it or not, there is a big problem,” he said.</p><p>Ghafory, 39, left Yemen in 1998 on a national scholarship to attend medical school in Cairo, then moved to Germany in 2011. He became known as a reliable source of Covid-19 information in late March, after <span><a href="https://almawqeapost.net/special-pens/4006">publishing</a></span> an article on Al-Mawqea Post, a Yemeni daily news website. </p><p>The piece detailed how the virus was spreading in Sana’a, the nation’s capital, and explained that the authorities were trying to pass it off as swine flu. It would take officials more than a month to publicly announce the first case in the city. </p><p>The article incensed Shiite Houthi rebels</p><p>The spokesman of the Houthi-run Ministry of Health told the Russian news outlet <span><a href="https://arabic.sputniknews.com/interview/202004041045071941-%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%82-%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%87%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%83-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86/">Sputnik</a></span> that the United States and Saudi Arabia had paid Ghafory to write the piece, in order to stymie Houthi efforts to recruit warriors to the frontlines.</p><p>Using his personal Facebook page and a mobile app named Tabiby (My Doctor), which he developed last year for Yemenis and others in the Middle East who lack access to healthcare, Ghafory marshals hundreds of medical professionals outside Yemen to provide free and accurate coronavirus advice.</p><p>The app, which <span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tabiby.tabibyusers">works</a></span> on Android smartphones and will soon be available on iPhones, connects patients to about 420 doctors around the world, who have volunteered to answer questions about health issues, provide psychological support, suggest realistic options for treatment and prevention, and potentially refer patients to doctors in Yemen. The app’s Covid-19 portal, launched in April, is the most visited of Tabiby’s 32 medical departments. </p><p>Ghafory is also working with Yemeni Nobel peace prize winner Tawakkol Karman to develop Combat Corona, a specialized medical team to treat Covid-19 cases in Yemen’s third-largest city, Taiz, which has been besieged by the Houthis since early in the war. They plan to replicate the initiative in other parts of Yemen. </p><p>On top of his day job and family life with his wife and young daughter, Ghafory’s coronavirus work has become its own full-time occupation. “Sometimes, I only have three or four hours of sleep to reprogram my mind for the next day. I don’t know how, but in one way or another I get it done,” he said.</p><p>According to Ghafory, Houthi disinformation related to Covid-19 has only grown as the virus has spread. </p><p>More recently, they have confused the situation by telling the public that Covid-19 was not the only disease causing widespread fevers in Sana’a. At the same time, Health Minister Taha Al-Mutawakel convened a meeting with the heads of private hospitals in Sana’a to inform them of about 1,300 known cases of Covid-19 in and around the city. </p><p>According to one of the hospital managers at the meeting, Mutawakel’s message was, “People don’t need to know about the problem, but you all need to deal with it.” Two weeks later, Mutawakel <span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/858">announced</a></span> that the Houthi government was conducting “promising and extensive scientific studies” to find a cure for the virus.</p><p>The Houthis now publicly acknowledge that Covid-19 is spreading in their areas of control, but have yet to release daily figures on new cases. Ghafory describes this approach as “acceptance plus negligence.”</p><p>“We would like to work together with the Houthis, and every other authority in the country, to combat this problem, but they won’t allow doctors in Sana’a to share information about the pandemic,” he said. “If they do, they are deemed betrayers.” – by Casey Coombs</p><p><span><a href="https://www.codastory.com/disinformation/yemeni-doctor-disinfo/">https://www.codastory.com/disinformation/yemeni-doctor-disinfo/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B E K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen Economic Bulletin: Another Stage-Managed Fuel Crisis</strong></p><p>Combined, these images would seem to tell a simple and compelling story: the Saudi-led coalition and Yemeni government are preventing fuel from entering Hudaydah to spite the Houthis, and ordinary Yemenis are paying the cost. </p><p>Yet the reality is much murkier. The truth is that the government and the Houthis are both guilty of participating in a self-interested tug of war to control fuel imports through Hudaydah, with little concern for the human cost of the disruption. This time around the Yemeni government, supported by the coalition, suspended approvals for fuel imports to dock and unload at Hudaydah throughout June. The Houthis, meanwhile, exploited the halt in fuel imports for political propaganda purposes and economic gain. By framing the fuel crisis as a symptom of foreign aggression that is exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation, the group attempted to absolve itself of any responsibility while cynically controlling the supply of fuel to market, driving up prices, and, by extension, Houthi revenues. </p><p>Origins of the Latest Fuel Standoff</p><p>Currently, all fuel import shipments headed to Houthi-controlled Hudaydah port must pass through the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) in Djibouti. Once cleared, they then proceed to the CHA for a security check by the Saudi-led coalition. Before receiving authorization to proceed to Hudaydah port, vessels must receive final approval from the government’s Technical Office of the Supreme Economic Council, which checks that importers have submitted the necessary paperwork, in accordance with government fuel import regulations. In June, however, the Yemeni government suspended permission for fuel tankers to exit the CHA and dock at Hudaydah port. The last fuel shipment to arrive at the port prior to this was aboard the Alejandrina on May 31, carrying 8,400 metric tons (MT) of fuel oil. As of June 30, a total of 20 vessels carrying a combined 500,000 MT of fuel were in the CHA.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/10323#Endnotes"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span> </p><p>The Yemeni government made the move after becoming suspicious that the Houthis had withdrawn up to 45 billion Yemeni rials (YR) from a ‘special account’ at the Central Bank of Yemen’s (CBY) Hudaydah branch, and misappropriated the funds by channeling them to the group’s war effort.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/10323#Endnotes"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span> The account contained months of fuel import taxes and customs fees which, per an agreement that the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen (OSESGY) <span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/8923#UN-Steps-In-to-Coordinate-Port-Access-Issues-but-Revenue-Dispute-Remains">brokered in November 2019</a></span> between the Houthis and the government, would be earmarked to pay public sector employees in Houthi-controlled areas.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/10323#Endnotes"><sup>[3]</sup></a></span> The mechanism was essentially a scaled-down version of an unrealized aspect of the <span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6808#DCM-The-Stockholm-Agreement">Stockholm Agreement</a></span>, in which the parties had agreed that revenues from Hudaydah, Saleef and Ras Issa ports would be deposited at CBY Hudaydah and used toward the payment of public sector salaries.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/10323#Endnotes"><sup>[4]</sup></a></span></p><p>The November fuel import mechanism was intended to prevent future disruptions to fuel imports entering through Hudaydah, which then get distributed in Houthi-controlled territories, following multiple fuel crises in 2019.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/10323#Endnotes"><sup>[5]</sup></a></span> In March and April last year, there was a significant buildup of vessels in the CHA and a disruption to the domestic fuel market after the Houthis allegedly urged importers not to comply with the government’s Decree 75, which outlined regulations that must be met for obtaining permission to import fuel into Yemen. Traders who wished to import via Hudaydah port already had to obtain authorization from the Houthi-run Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC) and agree to hand over the fuel to the YPC, the sole authorized fuel distributor in Houthi-controlled territory. As a sweetener, the Houthis offered to cover demurrage costs for vessels delayed from docking at the port, according to several fuel traders who spoke with the Sana’a Center at the time. The same standoff played out again in September last year, this time in reaction to the government’s Decree 49, which obligated all fuel importers to pay fuel import taxes and customs to the government in order to import fuel into Yemen, in addition to allowing for fuel quality control checks.</p><p>Funds in the CBY Hudaydah special account were supposed to be left untouched until the two sides agreed upon the list of public sector employees to be paid and which side would make up any difference in the amount needed to cover the salary payments. On April 16, the Houthi-run Supreme Economic Committee <span><a href="http://www.ypagency.net/252865">issued a statement</a></span> saying that the OSESGY mechanism had expired and that it would use revenues accumulated up until March 31 to unilaterally start paying an undisclosed number of public sector employees in Houthi-controlled territories half salaries, though as of the end of June there was little indication that these payments had been made.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/10323#Endnotes"><sup>[6]</sup></a></span> </p><p>Evidence that the funds were withdrawn and used for Houthi military campaigns is circumstantial.

In a June 6 letter to United Nations Resident Coordinator for Yemen Lise Grande, the Houthis argued that blocking fuel tankers from entering Hudaydah had a considerable negative impact on the humanitarian situation in Yemen, with the lack of fuel directly affecting hospitals, and health, hygiene and water sectors in general. This argument was echoed in a Houthi-run <span><a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3392298864114660&amp;id=321250264552884">YPC circular</a></span> on June 9.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/10323#Endnotes"><sup>[12]</sup></a></span> </p><p>Houthi authorities’ statements on the ramifications of acute shortages are worrying, given the scale of Yemen’s humanitarian and economic crises. </p><p>Fuel Rationing and Higher Prices Leads to More Revenues for the Houthis</p><p>The government’s decision to suspend fuel imports appears to have thrown the Houthis a lifeline on their bet on importing cheap fuel, allowing the group to create the public perception of shortages and justify fuel rationing, in turn increasing market prices and allowing the group to recoup more revenues.

That fact though has done little to stifle the Kingdom’s apparent appetite for new sources of crude. Now, following over five years of all-out war against its southern neighbor, Saudi Arabia is scrambling to secure rights over Yemen’s potentially bountiful reserves of oil.</p><p>Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company, is seeking decades-long strategic agreements with the internationally recognized government in exile of Abdul Mansour al-Hadi, which is backed by the Saudi-led coalition and the United States, to gain control of Yemen substantial oil and gas reserves, particularly in the oil-rich provinces of al-Jawf, Marib, Shabwa, and Hadramout, according to officials. The move could inflame enough anger among Yemen’s many warring and fractious parties to band together against what is increasingly viewed as an existential threat to Yemen’s sovereignty.</p><p>Officials in Yemen’s state-owned oil and gas company, known globally as Safer, as well as members of the transitional Hadi government who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, revealed to MintPress that negotiations are already taking place between Saudi Arabia and its allies with officials in Yemen’s ministry of oil and Safer to reach an agreement that would ostensibly hand control of much of Yemen’s oil and gas reserves to Saudi Arabia for decades to come.</p><p>A number of meetings have already taken place between high-ranking Saudi officials, including Saudi ambassador to Yemen Mohammed Al-Jaber and officials from Aramco, and Yemeni leaders, including interim vice president of the transitional government Ali Hussen al-Ahmer, governor of Marib Sheikh Sultan al-Arada and officials from both Safer and Yemen’s Ministry of Oil. Negotiators from French oil company TOTAL reportedly attended some of the meetings held in Marib, al-Mahrah, and the Saudi capital of Riyadh.</p><p>According to a source in Yemen’s transitional government, Saudi Arabia is seeking long-term lease agreements over the much of country’s oil reserves, particularly in what some officials have called “the oil triangle,” an area between al-Jawf and Marib provinces. Under the agreement, Saudi Arabia would be allowed to develop Yemen’s oil reserves and retain the profits from the sale of said oil in exchange for an annual remittance that would be paid by Aramco to certain members of the Yemeni government. The agreement stipulates that the payments are only required if the government remains friendly to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Jalal al-Salahi, a Yemeni activist known to have close ties to decision-makers in the transitional government, recently <span><a href="https://youtu.be/KNZiqQUu2EM">released a video</a></span> in which he claimed to be in possession of a draft document of an oil agreement between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. In the video, which has already garnered nearly 90,000 views since it was published to YouTube on July 4, Al-Salah said the document shows that the Saudi government is to pay $15 billion to certain Yemeni officials in return for seventy years of oil concessions in al-Jawf. Sources in Yemen’s transitional government refused to deny or confirm the authenticity of the document but told <em>MintPress </em>that some of the claims being made on social media are true without specifying which ones.</p><p>According to official sources, under the Saudi deal, payments would go to a fund restricted to what the Kingdom calls “Yemen’s debts and reconstruction.” Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s most repressive monarchies and wealthiest countries, launched a U.S.-backed scorched-earth campaign against its southern neighbor under the auspices of restoring the government of ousted President Hadi to power and is now pushing, along with the UAE, for Yemenis to compensate the Saudi-led coalition for the war it has waged on their country.</p><p>Negotiations to wrest long-term de facto control over Yemen ostensibly began in 2019 and have been marked by Saudi pressure and threats according to a source close to the negotiations. In fact, Riyadh has kept high-level officials in the Hadi government, including Hadi himself as well as Yemen’s <span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/tag/parliament/">members</a></span> of <span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/tag/parliament/">parliament</a></span>, under house arrest in Saudi Arabia. Yemeni officials that have been allowed to stay in Yemen are confined to coalition-controlled areas and cannot leave the country without permission from Riyadh and Abu Dubai.</p><p>The potential Saudi move is not without precedent. Saudi Arabia has been securing its objectives in Yemen by enabling its allies in the Yemeni government to take power in exchange for profitable long-term agreements for years. Yemen’s history is rife with these sorts of long-term agreements, including the <span><a href="https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Saudi%E2%80%93Yemeni_War_(1934)">Treaty of Taif signed in 1934</a></span> between the emerging Saudi state and the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, which handed Saudi Arabia control over the former Yemeni provinces of Jizan, Najran, and Asir.</p><p>Yemen’s stolen oil</p><p>It was about 9:20 a.m. at the Block 18 oil field in Marib, Yemen when H.A.Y.K., an oil tanker driver who wished to be identified only by his initials, put his hand in his pocket to make sure that his recently acquired “official permit” to cross the Saudi border was where it was supposed to be. H.A.Y.K. was not alone, eight drivers had gotten into their trucks that morning and started their engines in preparation for the journey. Minutes later, the crude oil-laden convoy lurched ahead and was soon inside Saudi territory accompanied by at least six armored Toyota Land Cruisers from the Coalition-backed Al-Abra Military Brigade and laden with a shipment of crude oil stolen from Block 18.</p><p>H.A.Y.K told <em>MintPress </em>that after a treacherous drive through Yemen’s northeast border region, he crossed the Saudi border into the Bishah District in the southwestern Saudi province of Asir where he unloaded his truck. Saudi Arabia and UAE are believed to be transferring stolen oil into the Sharq Eaidh desert located between Shabwa and Marib provinces. It is then pumped through a pipeline owned by an unidentified Austrian company to the UAE-controlled Al-Nashima Port on the Arabian Sea where it is then transferred to small oil vessels.</p><p>The theft of crude has become a daily occurrence in Safer’s Blocks 4, 5, and 18, as well as in other oil fields in the province, including the al-Uqlah Block (S2) located in the Marib-Shabwa Basin east of Block 18. Thefts have also become prolific in the Shabwa, Hadremout, and al-Mahrah provinces.</p><p>But the presence of crude oil-filled trucks crossing the Saudi border tripled in the second week of March when the Saudi-Russia oil price war was at its peak, according to oil engineers and tanker drivers that spoke to <em>MintPress</em>. This could suggest that Saudi Arabia was likely pumping oil stolen from Yemen into the international market, albeit in small quantities, at a time when losses by oil-producing companies in the U.S. were skyrocketing. Hedging untapped Yemeni oil reserves would give Saudi Arabia an important advantage in negotiations with competing oil-producing countries like Russia and the United States.</p><p>According to economists and officials who spoke to <em>MintPress</em>, up to 65 percent of Yemen’s oil produced since 2015, when the war began, has been looted by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and international oil companies and some 18-23 percent of crude production, including that produced by Safer and Petrol Masilah, is being looted by tribal leaders and black market traders allied with the Saudi coalition.</p><p>Militant groups and tribal factions allied with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in Marib and other eastern provinces, particularly the El-Eslah Party and the Southern Transitional Council as well as personnel close to Hadi, including his son Jalal, are all involved in the looting of Yemen’s oil and gas and have used heavy equipment belonging to Safer and TOTAL to extract crude oil assisted by engineers from both companies.</p><p>Ansar Allah leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi said in a <span><a href="http://althawrah.ye/archives/602182">televised speech</a></span> that more than 120 million barrels of crude oil have been looted by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates since 2016, amounting to nearly 80 billion Yemeni Rials worth of lost revenue per month.

But analysts doubted this assertion, while also acknowledging there is indeed room for Turkey to get involved in Yemen.</p><p>An information war?</p><p>UAE-financed news media recently published a series of articles alleging that Turkey and Qatar were leading a coordinated campaign in Yemen to roil the Saudi-led Arab coalition's endeavor in bringing peace between the Yemeni government-in-exile under President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and the Southern separatists or the Southern Transitional Council (STC). </p><p>This comes as Saudi Arabia is scrambling to unite the UAE-backed STC and the Saudi-sponsored Hadi administration in a broader military campaign against Iran-aligned Houthis in northern Yemen.</p><p>But Turkish state media has strenuously contested such allegations and questioned the credibility of the reports.</p><p>UAE-linked news platforms have been involved in a "carefully crafted disinformation campaign that targets Turkey's so-called role in Yemen," Turkish media said.</p><p>Independent observers also raised skepticism of these accounts' accuracy, suggesting they fit into a narrative that Abu Dhabi-associated media has been promulgating – which tends to overstate a Turkish threat in Yemen. </p><p>Although Turkey has indeed built ties in Yemen, these allegations exaggerated the scope and intensity of Turkish involvement in the war-stricken country, and served as a smokescreen to divert attention from the rise of the STC and the likely fall of the Hadi government, said assistant professor at Kings College London Dr. Andreas Krieg. </p><p>For Abu Dhabi, the propensity to heap blame on Turkey arises from its need to eschew scrutiny on its support for the STC, as funding from the UAE has emboldened the Southern separatists.</p><p>Turkey's regional role</p><p>Putting aside the credibility of these reports, the underlying notion does raise questions over the extent to which Turkey is involved in Yemen and whether Ankara has an incentive to enter the fray. </p><p>"Part of Turkey's greater ambition is to restore its influence in all areas that had been under the Ottoman Empire in the past, and it wants to outflank Saudi Arabia from the south," said Litvak.</p><p>Turkey, along with Qatar, forms the crux of an emerging Islamist bloc in the Middle East and North Africa. Both have extended direct aid to their proxies on multiple battlefronts, while in other parts of the region, they have also been promoting activities in line with a soft power approach via organized humanitarian outreach. The aim is to counter the influence of what is called the Saudi-UAE-Egypt axis and expand a support base that mostly consists of Islamist sympathizers.</p><p>The Turkey-Qatar alliance and the Saudi-UAE-Egypt axis almost always find themselves on the opposing sides of interminable conflicts in the region.</p><p>Potential entry in Yemen</p><p>In Yemen, the influential al-Islah Party is considered the main entry point through which Turkey can find its way into the scene as they are more ideologically aligned with one another. But at the same time, al-Islah is also forging closer relations with its previous foe, the Saudis. </p><p>"Turkey may well extend limited assistance to al-Islah, but it is unlikely that the party will jeopardize its support from the Saudis," wrote Omar Ahmed, a Middle East analyst, in an opinion piece published by London-based news website Middle East Monitor.</p><p>Coupled with the coronavirus havoc and Riyadh's ambition to diversify its oil-dependent economy, the Saudis are even less likely to sustain the years-long war. This reality, which helps explain why Riyadh is eager to find a political solution for the Hadi government - STC rivalry, also leaves room for Turkey to maneuver among different parties in Yemen.</p><p>Given Turkey's regional aspirations, it will probably try to insert itself in Yemen, Litvak said. "Meanwhile, Yemen is so fragmented that it is possible that some forces will seek Turkish help."</p><p>There is also an interesting development that may indicate a growing demand among al-Islah supporters for Turkish intervention in Yemen – an overture circulating in an online hashtag campaign.</p><p>This online campaign was launched in June, nearly a month after Turkey achieved major military success in Libya, indicating that the electrifying effects of such success may have traveled deep into the heart of Yemen and possibly other parts of the region as well, arousing potential support for Turkey.</p><p>What may also create the right conditions for Turkey to unsettle its regional foes in Yemen is that its home population is showing a growing approval for its overseas military adventure.</p><p>Yet it is unlikely that Turkey will all at once begin heavily investing its resources in Yemen, as Ankara is currently too preoccupied with multiple conflicts on its home front, said Livak. He also added that greater involvement in Yemen might put Turkey on the opposite side to Houthi-allied Iran, which shares mutual interests with Ankara – by Li Ruikang</p><p><span><a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-07-12/Is-Turkey-entrenching-itself-in-Yemen-amid-escalating-strife-with-UAE--S4heDFiEWQ/index.html">https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-07-12/Is-Turkey-entrenching-itself-in-Yemen-amid-escalating-strife-with-UAE--S4heDFiEWQ/index.html</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong>Locust invasion in Yemen stokes food insecurity fears</strong></p><p>Locust swarms have swept over farms in central, southern and eastern parts of Yemen, ravaging crops and stoking fears of food insecurity.</p><p><span>Residents and farmers in the provinces of Marib, Hadramout, Mahra and Abyan said that billions of locusts had invaded farms, cities and villages, devouring important seasonal crops such as dates and causing heavy losses.<br />“This is like a storm that razes anything it encounters,” Hussein Ben Al-Sheikh Abu Baker, an agricultural official from Hadramout’s Sah district, told Arab News on Sunday.<br />Images and videos posted on social media showed layers of creeping locusts laying waste to lemon farms in Marb, dates and alfalfa farms in Hadramout and flying swarms plunging cities into darkness. “The locusts have eaten all kinds of green trees, including the sesban tree.

Farmers complained that locusts had wiped out entire seasonal crops that are grown after rains.<br />Abu Baker said that he visited several affected farms in Hadramout, where farmers told him that if the government would not compensate them for the damage that it should at least get ready for a second potential locust wave that might occur in 10 days.<br />“The current swarms laid eggs that are expected to hatch in 10 days.

In this miserable situation, several communicable diseases have massively re-emerged including cholera, diarrhea, dengue, and measles, as a result of weapons used during the years of war according to geospatial patterns of the infected cases. According to the world health organization (WHO), only 51% of health care facilities across the country are fully functional, mainly due to the war. The fragile health system has extremely limited capacity to adopt and implement effective preparedness and response measures to the COVID-19 outbreak. The first and most imperative step to combat COVID-19 in Yemen is ending the devastating war without delay and terminating the land, sea and air blockade imposed by the coalition. International humanitarian organizations should also dedicate a high level joint action to implement a series of well-coordinated measures emphasizing both whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to protect Yemenis’ right in life and health.</p><p><span><a href="https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-020-01231-2">https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-020-01231-2</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>A midwife sacrificed her life to save a pregnant women amid the fear of COVID-19 in Aden</p><p>Ashwaq also died, after being infected with coronavirus while assisting her neighbor to give birth.

Teams from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) have started recently supporting a new COVID-19 treatment centre in Sheikh Zayed hospital in the Yemeni capital Sana’a.</p><p>Only half of the 20 beds for patients with moderate coronavirus symptoms in Sheikh Zayed hospital are currently occupied. According to our staff, many people regard hospitals as a source of infection, while some believe sinister rumours about what happens in hospitals for patients who have symptoms of COVID-19.</p><p>Others are fearful of being stigmatised by their communities if they test positive for the disease. As a result, many Yemenis are not seeking medical care until their condition is serious.</p><p>“We are seeing at first-hand the detrimental impact of misinformation that is being circulated all over the country, augmenting fear of the virus in society,” says MSF’s Dr Abdulrahman, who works in Sheikh Zayed hospital. “Hospitals are safe places for patients, and the earlier that patients come to hospital, the better the chances we have to treat their symptoms.”</p><p>Many patients arriving at the hospital’s emergency room are in a critical condition and need immediate support to breathe. All six beds are currently occupied in the intensive care unit, where patients in severe respiratory distress receive around-the-clock care, dependent on black and red oxygen cylinders that need to be changed every three hours.</p><p>“We are concerned over what we see in the hospital, but an even greater concern is the patients we don’t see – those who choose not to seek medical treatment until their condition deteriorates considerably,” says Caroline Ducarme, MSF’s Head of Mission in Yemen.</p><p>Yemen has very limited testing capabilities for COVID-19 and so the virus is spreading across the country untraced. After years of war, the health system was already under considerable stress before the pandemic. Now it appears that people have lost trust in the health system and health staff.</p><p>Recent reports that health workers are at high risk of falling ill with the virus have also raised serious concerns about their safety among medical staff across the country, leading many to quit their jobs and stay at home, leaving hospitals short-staffed.</p><p>“One of the consistent challenges we face is finding skilled medical staff willing to work in a COVID-19 treatment centre, where they are needed most,” says Ducarme. “This is despite the use of personal protective equipment and the strict implementation of infection prevention and control measures in this hospital. The departure of health workers is further weakening the Yemeni health system.”</p><p>Sheikh Zayed hospital is the second COVID-19 treatment facility in Sana’a supported by MSF, along with Al-Kuwait hospital. Some of MSF’s patients have travelled long distances to get treatment in the capital, suggesting that there are many unmet medical needs elsewhere.</p><p>“A number of our patients in Sheikh Zayed hospital come from governorates as far as Taiz and Ad Dhale, in search of essential medical care that may be inaccessible in their areas,” explains Roger Gutiérrez, MSF’s Head of Emergencies in Yemen. “The patients we see have the means to travel, but what about those who are seriously ill with no means to travel and no other medical options around?”</p><p>More resources are desperately needed in Yemen, both for COVID-19 patients and for those with other health needs. We urge the international community to mobilise resources to help Yemen cope with this crisis, and call on Yemeni authorities to facilitate the implementation of lifesaving programmes.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.msf.org/covid-19-spreads-fear-drives-people-away-hospitals-yemen">https://www.msf.org/covid-19-spreads-fear-drives-people-away-hospitals-yemen</a></span></p><p>(* B H P)</p><p>COVID-19 in Yemen: A disaster rarely comes alone</p><p>The conditions in the <span><a href="https://www.msf.org/aden%E2%80%99s-only-covid-19-treatment-centre-we-are-seeing-catastrophe-unfold">COVID-19 treatment center in Aden</a></span>, operated by the NGO Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), give a better indication of the difficulties.

It is believed that many more people have died at home without having sought treatment, as more sudden deaths than usual have been reported in South Yemen since early May.

It was essentially a cry for help and ends with the words of Caroline Seguin, operations manager of MSF for Yemen: “We are doing all that we can, but we cannot face this virus alone. It would be unconscionable for the world to just leave Aden and the rest of Yemen to face this crisis by themselves.”</p><p>Recent months have shown that countries with much better-equipped health systems than Yemen are having, or have had, enormous problems in slowing and containing the pandemic. As a result, one can imagine the effects the disease will have in Yemen.

The pandemic has arrived in Yemen after five years of conflict, which has led to widespread damage and destruction of hospitals, markets, water and sanitation systems, and other civilian infrastructure, making access to clean water, medicine, and food insufficient and unpredictable for most Yemenis. The conflict has caused an estimated <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/3094388/">233,000 deaths</a></span>, with the majority due to a lack of food, health services and infrastructure -- an alarming sign of the weakness of basic services in the country.</p><p>IRC expects the COVID-19 outbreak in Yemen to be one of the most severe globally. The immediate harm from the disease and its wider, life-threatening impacts on livelihoods, food insecurity, and gender-based violence are set to exacerbate vulnerability. Lise Grande, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen, <span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/04/middleeast/yemen-coronavirus-intl/index.html">warns</a></span> the death toll from COVID-19 could "exceed the combined toll of war, disease, and hunger over the last five years."</p><p>Despite the steep challenges in Yemen, the humanitarian response has proven effective in the past in halting the spread of other diseases and health crises.

With robust funding, this humanitarian infrastructure and expertise can be effectively mobilized to address COVID-19.</p><p>Yet, in the face of an unprecedented threat, the international community has turned its back on Yemen. The response has not only been vastly insufficient to address the magnitude of COVID-19, but also represents a step back from previous commitments to the overall humanitarian crisis.

Now, the UN has warned that Yemen is once again on the brink of famine. Its donor funds that had averted the catastrophe in early 2019 dwindle. The coronavirus pandemic which rages through the country unchecked adds to the problem, leaving people increasingly vulnerable. </p><p>What Yemen truly needs is an end to the fighting. This can only happen through a truce worked out between the Yemeni government, the Houthis separatist elements and their primary foreign backers – mainly the Saudis, the Iranians and the Emiratis.

Sie gründete einen Förderverein, baute mit Hilfe von Spenden ein Krankenhaus und ein Kinderheim. Für viele der Waisen dort ist sie die „Mama“.</p><p>Für Aenne Rappel ist das Land am Golf von Aden dennoch eines, für das sie im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes ihr letztes Hemd geben würde. „So grausam (wie jetzt) war es noch nie“, erzählt die 84-Jährige.</p><p>1996 blätterte sie in einem Reisemagazin, eine Reportage über den Jemen machte sie neugierig. Zusammen mit ihrer Cousine flog Rappel in das heute ärmste arabische Land.</p><p>Die Cousine brach sich dort ein Bein, gemeinsam mussten sie ein Krankenhaus aufsuchen: „Die hatten zwar ein Röntgengerät, aber ich glaube, das war eine Spende vom Röntgen persönlich. Die hatten nur zwei Gipsbinden. Die haben sie suchen müssen und haben sie uns geschenkt. Wir haben hinterher gesagt, das ist eigentlich ein Geschenk, das man gar nicht annehmen kann.“</p><p>Zurück in Deutschland gründete Aenne Rappel die Jemenhilfe und begann, Spenden für das Krankenhaus zu sammeln. Regelmäßig brachte sie persönlich Verbandsmaterial und Medikamente in das Land.</p><p>Dann kam der Tag, als die deutsche Spendensammlerin aus dem bayerischen Aichach von drei Beduinen gebeten wurde, ein Krankenhaus zu bauen. Das Land dafür würden sie ihr schenken.</p><p>„Ich habe versucht zu erklären, dass ich keine Millionärin bin. Das ich viele Menschen brauche, die helfen. Und ich wiederkomme, wenn ich Geld habe. Wenn ich nicht mehr komme, dann wissen sie, es ist mir nicht gelungen.“</p><p>Aenne Rappel kam wieder, mit 45.000 D-Mark. Das Krankenhaus wurde im Süden des Landes gebaut. Trotz regelmäßiger Bombardements: Das Gebäude ist immer noch intakt. Seit über 20 Jahren ist es jetzt Anlaufstelle für alle Menschen der Region. Egal ob Huthi-Rebellen oder IS-Kämpfer, hier wird jeder behandelt.</p><p><span>„Die liegen dann friedlich beieinander. Erst schießen sie, und wenn es weh tut, liegen sie brav nebeneinander im Bett.“ 6000 Euro überweist Aenne Rappel monatlich für das Krankenhaus, noch einmal 6000 Euro werden im Monat für ihr Kinderheim benötigt. Denn das hat die gelernte Horterzieherin ebenfalls gegründet. Auch das passierte eher zufällig. Während das Krankenhaus gebaut wurde, war Rappel viele Monate vor Ort. Sie lernte Arabisch und kam mit vielen Waisenkindern in Kontakt.</span></p><p><span>Für Aenne Rappel war bald klar, es muss auch noch ein Kinderheim her.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/aenne-rappel-vorsitzende-der-jemenhilfe-drei-beduinen-viele.970.de.html">https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/aenne-rappel-vorsitzende-der-jemenhilfe-drei-beduinen-viele.970.de.html</a></span></p><p><span>(B H P)</span></p><p><span>USAID: </span>Yemen ‑ Active USG Programs for Yemen Response (Last Updated 07/10/20)</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-active-usg-programs-yemen-response-last-updated-071020">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-active-usg-programs-yemen-response-last-updated-071020</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Final Report : Integrated WASH and C4D Intervention in Al Jawf and Sa’ada Governorates (2018-2019) Salim Wa Al Diyra Project, Al Jawf Gov.</p><p>A lack of water and poor water quality increase the risk of diarrhea and cholera in Al Jawf Governorate, which kill approximately hundreds of people every year.

This as the COVID-19 pandemic is set to peak and the conflict is escalating with civilians bearing the brunt.</p><p>Six weeks on from Yemen’s yearly funding conference, international donors have funded just 18% of the $3.37 billion needed to meet the urgent humanitarian need in the country. Funding from the Gulf States has dropped to record lows. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has provided just 2% of the funding it provided in 2019, while the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have provided no funding at all.</p><p>Already 80% of Yemen’s population, 24.3 million people, are reliant on aid for basic survival. Five years of conflict has caused an estimated <span><a href="https://www.undp.org/content/dam/yemen/General/Docs/ImpactOfWarOnDevelopmentInYemen.pdf">233,000 deaths</a></span>, with the majority due to a lack of food, health services and infrastructure - an alarming sign of the weakness of basic services in the country which must now contend with the rapidly advancing spread of COVID-19.</p><p>The United Nations has warned that 75% of Yemen’s programmes will be cut or curtailed due to the collapse in funding. <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-situation-report-2-july-2020-enar">Without additional funding</a></span>, 19 million people will lose access to health care, 8.4 million will lose access to water and sanitation services essential for mitigating the spread of Covid, and 2.5 million malnourished children will lose life saving nutrition support.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.rescue.org/press-release/alarming-drop-funding-yemen-millions-lives-are-jeopardy-warns-irc">https://www.rescue.org/press-release/alarming-drop-funding-yemen-millions-lives-are-jeopardy-warns-irc</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Paving Yemen’s treacherous roads: A life-saving path towards economic recovery and social stability</p><p>Bringing New Life into the World atop a Coffin</p><p>The rough roads of Dar al-Murair have caused great hardship for the entire village. As a breeding ground for disease and home to flood-induced craters, the roads are often impassable, cause tragic accidents, and have led to a significant loss of lives. For many years, locals had no choice but to transport food and essential items by donkey, their own backs, or – for the lucky few – by motorbike.</p><p>Residents have even had to carry family members and pregnant women in need of urgent medical care atop the coffins of the dead, reminiscent of a death march rather than the beginning of a new life. Tragically, many people have died on the journey to the hospital, as navigating even a few kilometers can take hours.</p><p>After being embroiled in a 5-year long civil war and now in the clutches of the <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/middleeast/yemen-coronavirus-deaths-intl/index.html">COVID-19</a></span> pandemic, life is even harder in rural Yemen, unpaved roads restrict access to vital services, resources, education, employment opportunities, and food supplies.</p><p>Because of interrupted salaries, short growing seasons, and the challenges of travelling to neighboring communities, some residents of Dar al-Murair have been forced to eliminate fruits and vegetables from their diets altogether.</p><p>Fortunately, a large portion of the village’s road – its roughest patches – were repaved in this year thanks to the support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Relief Fund (KSRelief) in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and implemented by the Public Works Project.</p><p>Searching for Water: Muammar’s Story</p><p>Forty-five-year-old Muammar Yacoub supports his wife and four children in the village of Al-Qala’a. From as far back as he can remember, the people of his village used to head out before sunrise to navigate the rugged terrain only to reach a small spring, 5 kilometers away.</p><p>After fetching water in plastic bottles or jerry cans, they would transport it home by donkey or on the heads of women and children. This process was not only time-consuming but also dangerous, as it involved facing predators and navigating rugged terrain that sometimes resulted in falls and even deaths.</p><p>Although villagers had the option to receive water deliveries, the cost peaked at 20,000 Yemeni Riyals (equivalent to US $35) and this only supplied enough for 2 weeks. Not surprisingly, some community members were forced to harvest rainwater that was ultimately contaminated due to a lack of proper storage methods and filters.</p><p>After drinking polluted water, they suffered from bilharzia, amoeba, diarrhea, and kidney stones. It got to a point where locals were too afraid to do laundry, clean their households, take care of their farms and livestock, or take a bath due to the scarcity of water and the effort it took to collect it.</p><p>These miserable conditions are all too common throughout the country. Only <span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/yemen/water-sanitation-and-hygiene">one-third</a></span> of Yemen’s 30 million people are connected to a piped water network, leaving another <span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/yemen/water-sanitation-and-hygiene">18 million in urgent need of safe drinking water and sanitation services</a></span> for their very survival. Against the stark backdrop of a global pandemic, improved water, sanitation, and hygiene services in communities and health facilities are crucial to ensure high-quality care and to minimize the risk of infections for patients, their families, and health workers.</p><p>The Power of Partnerships</p><p>The implementation of a water harvesting tank project – funded by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Relief Fund (KSRelief), in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and implemented by the Public Works Project – has eased the community’s suffering.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.ye.undp.org/content/yemen/en/home/presscenter/articles/2020/paving-yemen_s-treacherous-roads--a-life-saving-path-towards-eco.html">https://www.ye.undp.org/content/yemen/en/home/presscenter/articles/2020/paving-yemen_s-treacherous-roads--a-life-saving-path-towards-eco.html</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>IOM Regional Office for Middle East and North Africa COVID-19 Response - Situation Report 7 (25 June - 8 July 2020)</p><p>While Gender-Based Violence (GBV) increases during every type of emergency, of specific concern are the increase in reported GBV cases IOM and its partners are seeing in the region, in both humanitarian and nonhumanitarian settings. For example, recent findings from IOM in Iraq showed that 65 per cent of the service provision points reported an increase in one or more types of GBV in their areas of intervention. Of which, 94 per cent reported a sharp increase in domestic violence reportedly perpetrated by a spouse or other family member/s within the household. The lack of dedicated funding for GBV under COVID-19 needs to be urgently addressed.</p><p>The socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 continue to be felt across the region, especially its impact on female and male migrants in the informal sector and displaced populations. Responses to the socio-economic implications of COVID-19 continue to be largely underfunded, specifically socio-economic responses that are tailored to the different gender specific needs and opportunities for socio-economic recovery.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-regional-office-middle-east-and-north-africa-covid-19-response-situation-report-7">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-regional-office-middle-east-and-north-africa-covid-19-response-situation-report-7</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Islamic Relief pledges additional $10m for Yemen as hunger crisis grows and donor cuts devastate life-saving programmes amidst COVID case spike</p><p>Fears of mass rising levels of hunger in Yemen, fuelled by a deepening currency collapse and massive donor funding shortfalls, have prompted Islamic Relief to inject millions in emergency funding into the war-ravaged country, where the death rates for those testing positive for Covid-19 at 27 per cent are the highest in the world.</p><p>IR today announced it will provide an additional $10 million targeting food, WASH, nutrition and health programming, in an attempt to plug a small part of the massive funding gaps left by international donors’ inability last month to meet the UN’s $2.4bn fundraising target. Only half of this amount was pledged, with three-quarters of UN-backed programmes facing cuts or closures in the coming weeks.</p><p>Prior to the cuts, IR was working with the UN’s World Food Programme to deliver food packages to 2.3 million people every month. This has since been scaled back by 50 per cent with the same food pack, designed to provide enough food for a family for a month, having to last each family twice as long.</p><p>The shortfall comes even as the COVID epidemic has caused the health system to “in effect collapse” according to the UN.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/islamic-relief-pledges-additional-10m-yemen-hunger-crisis-grows-and-donor-cuts">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/islamic-relief-pledges-additional-10m-yemen-hunger-crisis-grows-and-donor-cuts</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span>Mother is Victim of Houthi Individual Mines in Taiz</p><p>Mrs. Jamelah Qasim lost her legs in a mine explosion as she was herding her sheep in Taiz.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA0XZXSOdSI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA0XZXSOdSI</a></span></p><p>Snippet: <span><a href="https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1281628246967087106">https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1281628246967087106</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp4 Flüchtlinge / Refugees</span></h2><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Flow Monitoring Points | Migrant Arrivals and Yemeni Returns in June 2020</p><p>From 1 to 30 of June 2020 IOM-DTM estimates that 749 migrants entered Yemen and 259 Yemeni returned from Republic of Djibouti.

IOM’s support came in the form of cash assistance to enable families in Yemen to purchase the materials and tools they need to rebuild damaged shelters.</p><p>Strong winds and heavy rains have caused massive destruction to thousands of shelters in displacement sites across Yemen earlier this year. Some shelters were partly damaged while others were torn down to the ground.

Due to its fierce climate and terrain, Marib’s displaced families often find themselves impacted by sandstorms and floods pouring down from surrounding hillsides. Many displaced Marib families lost not only their shelter, but also much of their belongings.</p><p>“The scene was heartbreaking,” said Jamal Al Shami, IOM Camp Management and Camp Coordination (CCCM) Field Assistant in Marib. “The strong wind ripped apart shelters, followed by heavy rains and floods that swept away what was left. There was nothing more to fix, and the families along with their children lost everything.
