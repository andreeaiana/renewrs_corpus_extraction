Islah officially supports the internationally recognized Yemeni government of President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi; however, the party’s increasing capacity to act independently in Taiz represents a further erosion of the state’s purview within areas the government supposedly controls. Islah’s rise in Taiz, if solidified, is likely to complicate United Nations-led efforts to secure a peace agreement between the Houthi leadership and the internationally recognized Yemeni government. It also threatens potential post-conflict efforts to stabilize the country’s political and security environments and establish effective state sovereignty.</p> <p>With the escalation of the ongoing conflict in March 2015, Taiz City and the wider governorate have been an epicenter of violence, with Houthi fighters continually clashing with various anti-Houthi forces. Within the anti-Houthi coalition in Taiz City, Islah-affiliated forces and the Salafi-oriented Abu al-Abbas Brigades have also had long-running tensions and periodic clashes. Among the former’s most prominent backers are Yemeni Vice President Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar and President Hadi’s chief of staff Abdulla al-Alimi; while the Abu al-Abbas Brigades are supported by the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p> <p>On August 8, 2018, intense clashes between Islah-affiliated groups and the Abu al-Abbas Brigades erupted, prompting President Hadi to hold an emergency meeting with Governor of Taiz Amin Mahmoud. Following this, Hadi announced the creation of a presidential committee to end the violence. The presidential committee, however, was dominated by Islah figures. Most prominent among these, and the committee chair is Abdu Farhan Salem, commonly referred to as “Salem.” He is arguably the most important Islah-affiliated military official in Taiz, as an advisor to the commander of the Taiz Military Axis, Khaled Fadl – also an Islah figure.</p> <p>The presidential committee brokered a deal in which both the Abu al-Abbas Brigades and Islah-affiliated national army units and militias agreed to withdraw from positions within Taiz City. On August 18, the committee reported that all positions had been handed over to the Presidential Guard. However, by month’s end it was clear that while Abu al-Abbas’ forces had withdrawn, Islah-affiliated forces remained.</p> <p>In September, Governor Mahmoud publicly thanked the presidential committee for its efforts before asking that it be dissolved, having seemingly fulfilled its mandate. The committee refused, insisting that, having been established through a presidential decree, another presidential decree was required for it to be dissolved. To date, President Hadi has not issued such a decree.</p> <p>In the meantime, Islah affiliates have leveraged the committee’s apparent authority to assert control over the official security apparatuses in Taiz that had technically been under the governor’s jurisdiction. Within these institutions, Islah has dismissed officials considered unloyal to it while promoting Islah affiliates. The committee has also facilitated the withdrawal of other anti-Houthi forces from areas around Taiz, in place of whom Islah-affiliated forces have moved in. Aiding Islah’s expanding clout in Taiz are the group’s strong grassroots support, local business ties, and loyalists in senior military positions. Currently, the largest anti-Houthi force unaffiliated with Islah still present in Taiz City is the Yemeni army’s 35th Armoured Brigade, which has worked closely with the Abu al-Abbas Brigades and is backed by the UAE.</p> <p><span><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6634">http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6634</a> </span></p> <p><strong>(** B E H)</strong></p> <p><strong>Solar Power And The Yemeni Civil War</strong></p> <p>Little about Yemen would suggest that it represents the next frontier for renewable energy.</p> <p>The Yemeni civil war has <a href="http://www.yemenmonitor.com/Manage/Archive/ArtMID/905/ArticleID/17700/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%A4%D9%83%D8%AF-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%B5%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A5%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%BA%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%A9">led</a> to the destruction of countless electric power systems, more than <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/sanaas-solar-revolution-solar-panels-yemen">halving</a> the availability of electric power throughout the country.

Given these challenges, Chinese-manufactured solar panels <a href="http://www.oskran.com/p-574?utm_source=Members&amp;utm_campaign=f9aeca1f55-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_07_18&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_e842221dc2-f9aeca1f55-194860893">offer</a> the best alternative.</p> <p>“For most Yemenis, there was no choice but to buy solar panels for light and their basic electrical needs,” Safia Mahdi, a Sanaa-based journalist who <a href="http://unohrlls.org/competition-winner-safia-al-kawmani/">won</a> recognition for <a href="https://www.dw.com/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%80-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D8%B6%D9%88%D8%A1-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D8%B8%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B3/a-42086030">documenting</a> this phenomenon, told <em>LobeLog</em>. “The majority of Yemenis have relied on solar panels for the duration of the war.”</p> <p>Residents of Sanaa, where blackouts were commonplace well before the Yemeni civil war, <a href="http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/articles/entry/civil_war_spurs_spike_in_solar_energy_use_in_yemen/">turned</a> to solar power after Emirati and Saudi airstrikes damaged electrical grids in the Houthi-held capital in 2015. The trend soon <a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2017/10/17/yemenis-seek-solar-solution-to-infrastructure-blackout">reached</a> the cities of al-Hudaydah, Ibb, and Taiz as well as rural areas—spanning territories under the control of the Houthis and the Yemeni government alike. For its part, civil society facilitated the spread of solar power in Yemen through projects such as Green Pages, an initiative to <a href="http://greenpages.solar/en/about.php?id=4#.XDqDCs9Kirc">help</a> Yemenis affected by the energy crisis determine how and where to buy solar panels.</p> <p>“Solar power’s use in homes is mostly limited to running home appliances, namely turning on lights, powering televisions, washing clothes, and charging phones,” said Ibrahim Youseffi, an electrical engineer in Sanaa who has worked with several aid agencies. “Those with money have systems large enough to operate air conditioning as well as fans and pumps.”</p> <p>By January 2016, over 40 percent of Yemenis had come to <a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/society/2016/1/6/yemenis-turn-to-solar-energy-amid-electricity-blackouts">rely</a> on solar power to meet their basic needs. Solar panels had even begun to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/world/middleeast/yemen-war-solar-power-economy.html">appear</a> mounted on ice cream carts and motorized wheelchairs in Sanaa, speaking to the accessibility of solar power in a country where millions were still struggling to find enough food and water.</p> <p>For many Yemenis, climate change represents a matter of life and death. Global warming has <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/desertification-threat-millions-yemenis">accelerated</a> desertification, a threat to the viability of agriculture in the Yemeni hinterland, and <a href="http://www.atimes.com/article/in-yemen-cities-spared-from-war-fall-prey-to-climate-change/">increased</a> the frequency of cyclones, which cause destructive flash floods along the coasts. Water scarcity presents an even greater challenge: Yemen may soon <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/yemen-humanitarian-crisis-water-54a9c0b52831/">exhaust</a> its entire water supply. Attacks on Yemeni water supply networks powered by solar panels have only <a href="https://www.unicef.org/mena/press-releases/access-water-continues-be-jeopardized-millions-children-war-torn-yemen">worsened</a> this critical problem.</p> <p>“All the reports and studies indicate that Yemen is one of the most water-poor countries in the world,” said Abdoul Razaz Saleh, a former Yemeni Water and Environment Minister.</p> <p>Yemenis across the political spectrum managed to overcome their energy crisis and unite behind solar power with the support of the international community. This achievement can serve as inspiration for the kind of mass mobilization that Yemen needs to confront climate change as a whole.</p> <p>“The international community can help Yemenis overcome water scarcity and climate change by deploying solar power on a large enough scale,” Elayah told <em>LobeLog</em>. “Yemen is rich in sun.” – by Austin Bodetti</p> <p><span><a href="https://lobelog.com/solar-power-and-the-yemeni-civil-war/">https://lobelog.com/solar-power-and-the-yemeni-civil-war/</a> </span></p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>A Modest Proposal: An Anti-Militarist New Year’s Resolution for America</strong></p> <p>What if Donald Trump was serious about extracting the U.S. military from the Greater Middle East? To do so would require a total revamping of American foreign policy.</p> <p>So, in that spirit, let’s take a break from the standard critique of existing US foreign policy and conjure a world as it should be, not as it is. Consider this the ultimate New Year’s make believe – a resolution to swear off militarism and forever war in the Greater Middle East.</p> <p>It would begin with a restructuring of the entire legal framework for American war-making. US soldiers still kill and die – and bomb at least <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/news/2018/03/the-d-brief-march-15-2018/146688/">seven</a> countries – under two outdated Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). </p> <p> In 2019, the US Congress should reassert its constitutional primacy in warfare, overturn the old AUMFs, and demonstrate the courage to debate and vote on each of America’s ongoing wars. If the people’s representatives truly believe any of the ongoing shooting wars – in Syria, Libya, Niger, Iraq, Yemen, Pakistan, and Afghanistan – are worth fighting, then let them say so publicly and declare war.</p> <p>My guess is that most congressmen, knowing the prevailing public <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/21/trump-afghanistan-war-troops-241871">skepticism</a>of ongoing overseas interventions, wouldn’t authorize the continuation of these disastrous campaigns. America’s forever warfare state might wither under the light of legitimate oversight. Nevertheless, no matter how Congress voted, the very act of public debate and accountability would be a refreshing change for our ostensible republic. When it comes to the momentous decisions of war and peace, more, not less, transparency should be the norm in 2019.</p> <p>Next, in our dream scenario, the US House would pass the recent <a href="http://time.com/5479319/senate-vote-stop-supporting-saudi-yemen-war/">Senate Bill</a>and pull all American military support from the disastrous Saudi-led terror war in Yemen. Then, in a surprise reversal of his stated intent, President Trump wouldn’t veto but rather sign this better-late-than-never legislation. The withdrawal of all US intelligence, logistics, and munitions support might then slow the pace of the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophe – which has led to the starvation <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46261983">deaths</a> of at least 85,000 Yemeni children.</p> <p>While we’re at it, the president and Congress would take matters even further, to wit, freezing all military aid and arms sales to Saudi Arabia until it ends its war in Yemen, fesses up to the murder of Jamal Khassogi, and removes Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) as crown prince.

The aim of the World Health Organization (WHO) is to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by 2030, and to eliminate the disease from 20 of the 48 affected countries.

A resumption in violence now threatens the fragile agreement. However, the shifting narrative concerning Saudi Arabia’s role will play a critical role in resolving the conflict – or at least in alleviating the tragic humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>However, the growing international outcry for humanitarian concerns in Hodeida, as well as <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1030582">support</a> from the UN in the form of a new resolution to support the Hodeida agreement (UNMHA), provide strong incentives for the Houthis and the government to cooperate. The initial willingness of the factions, as well as regional players such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, to back the initial UN agreement, signals that peaceful progress is possible. If all parties remain committed and cooperate with the UN monitoring team, then a broader regional ceasefire is possible.</p> <p>The <a href="https://globalriskinsights.com/2018/10/khashoggi-saudi-relations-west-much-damage-done/">reputational damage </a>caused by Khashoggi’s murder should not be underestimated, with Saudi Arabia facing increasing <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/13/is-yemens-torment-finally-ending/">international pressure</a>.

The willingness of the Houthis and the government to come to the table demonstrates a newfound desire to achieve peace.

Essentially everyone agrees that the Saudis are the aggressors, but what’s the overall significance of this war?</p> <p>Ever since the assassination of Yemeni President Ibrahim al Hamdi in 1977, Yemen has been swallowed by Saudi influence, funding mosques and schools across the country, especially in the Zaydi heartland, like the Mosque in Dammaj. This war is Yemen attempting to regain its independence by throwing off that influence.</p> <p>The political substance of the republican revolution in North Yemen (1962-67) had been so subverted by Saudi money, and pacified by Wahhabi ideology, that it did not hesitate to crack down hard on the revival of Zaydism because to them it represented a rival claim to Yemeni nationalism.</p> <p>The six Sa’ada wars from 2004-10 were started by the Saleh government, not by [Houthi-led] Ansarullah, which never began by attempting the armed overthrow of the Yemeni state, instead only promoting the message that Yemen was being kept artificially poor, as Saudi Arabia’s cheap labour pool, and unable to fully exploit its resources, because of its corrupt leaders and their subservience to Riyadh.</p> <p><a href="https://www.fort-russ.com/2019/01/why-is-yemen-ignored-when-syria-dominates-the-headlines/">https://www.fort-russ.com/2019/01/why-is-yemen-ignored-when-syria-dominates-the-headlines/</a></p> <p>Comment by Judith Brown: <span>This isn't the only reason why the war in Yemen is ignored. My research indicated that the government - a main source of news for the U.K. media - never made a statement on Yemen unless it was forced to respond to a story. Journalists from U.K. have severely restricted access to Yemen so journalists cannot lead with a story to which the government is forced to respond. And the arms industry denies it has any responsibility for the misuse of its products - e.g., their use to destroy civilians and civilian infrastructure- and the media accepts their denial of responsibility instead of holding them to account. As for the rest of the article it does give the story of the Houthi wars from a different viewpoint which is important in order to help to understand the complexity of the Houthi position. Interestingly when I was in Yemen in 2004-2008 talking to Yemenis they denied that the Houthis were Zaidi - which demonstrates the way that Saleh was able to control discourses surrounding the Saada wars.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157311885743641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157311885743641</a> </p> <p><span>(* B K P)</span></p> <p>Report : Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen has failed</p> <p>In fact, on almost every measure, Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen has failed, three and a half years after the launch of what was meant to be a quick military operation, the Houthis are stronger than ever, al-Qaeda terrorists remain a major threat.</p> <p>The ongoing aggression by the Saudi-led coalition has devastated Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, The war is estimated to have cost the Saudis upwards of $100 billion, eroded the international image of the kingdom and failed to achieve any of its objectives.<br /> At the onset of the war, the Saudi king and his heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, were confident that their clear military advantage would provide for an easy victory, which would in turn cement Riyadh’s position as a formidable force in the region.<br /> In its campaign against Yemen, Saudi Arabia enjoys intelligence and logistical aid from the Americans, and has the fourth largest security budget in the world as well as advanced weaponry at its disposal.<br /> Yet, the kingdom is finding it difficult to defeat a determined Yemeni army and resistance groups such as Ansarullah. In fact, in addition to holding on to the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, and other key areas, Yemeni army forces, supported by allied fighters from Popular Committees have fired over hundreds of missiles deep into Saudi territory and have captured over one hundred square miles within the kingdom.<br /> In addition to that, the war has made both Saudi Arabia and the UAE less secure than they were before.<br /> The Saudis claim they will have no choice but to escalate the war if they cannot reach an agreement at the talks.<br /> But it would be far better than continuing with a war that has had incalculable humanitarian, financial, strategic and reputational costs for the Saudis but has not remotely advanced their own declared objectives.</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news523838.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news523838.htm</a> = <a href="https://nthnews.net/en/yemennews/saudi-failure-in-war-of-yemen/">https://nthnews.net/en/yemennews/saudi-failure-in-war-of-yemen/</a> </span></p> <p><span>Remark: A pro-Houthi viewpoint.</span></p> <p><span>(A K)</span></p> <p>Civilian killed in raid by plane believed to be American in Al-Sawma’ah in Al-Baydha</p> <p>A civilian was killed by an air raid by an aircraft believed to be a US drone on Monday, a local source said, in the area of “Ja’er” in Al-Sawma’ah district of al-Baydha province.</p> <p>The source told Al-Masdar online that the air strike targeted Saleh Ma'raj al-Qaisi car at 10 a.m. Tuesday near the health unit, which led to his immediate death.</p> <p>He noted that al-Qaisi had no connection with extremist organizations in the province.</p> <p>According to the source, unmanned aerial planes have been flying in the area continuously for two days.</p> <p><a href="http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163405">http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163405</a></p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/FuadRajeh/status/1087386555814211584">https://twitter.com/FuadRajeh/status/1087386555814211584</a> </span></p> <p><span>(* B H K)</span></p> <p><span>Film: </span>Exclusive: Civilians pay the price for war in Houthi-controlled northern Yemen</p> <p>A FRANCE 24 team travelled to northern Yemen, a region held by Shiite Houthi rebels that has been at the centre of a Saudi-led military campaign.

In a recent paper, Martha Mundy, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, analyzed coalition airstrikes in Yemen, finding that their attacks on bridges, factories, fishing boats and even fields suggested that they aimed to destroy food production and distribution. </p> <p>It’s not just bombs, bullets and artillery shells that threaten Yemen’s children, this is a conflict that also kills by stealth. Economic strangulation is being used by the Saudi-led coalition as a weapon of war, targeting jobs, infrastructure, food markets and the provision of basic services. </p> <p>The UN has described Yemen as “the world’s worst humanitarian disaster”. Almost two-thirds of the population need emergency support. The food system is collapsing, pushing the country to the brink of famine. </p> <p><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news523514.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news523514.htm</a> </span></p> <p><span>(* A K)</span></p> <p>Blast kills 5 demining experts in Yemen: security source</p> <p>An explosion killed five demining specialists in war-torn Yemen's central province of Maarib on Sunday, security and medical sources said.</p> <p>A pro-government security official, who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, said the the five were foreign experts working on the Saudi-backed Masam landmine clearance project.</p> <p>AFP could not independently confirm which countries they came from.</p> <p>The official said the blast occurred as landmines were being transported to be destroyed.</p> <p>A medic at a Maarib hospital confirmed five bodies were brought to the hospital, adding that a number of other people were injured in the incident.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6612093/Blast-kills-5-demining-experts-Yemen-security-source.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6612093/Blast-kills-5-demining-experts-Yemen-security-source.html</a> </span></p> <p><span>and also <a href="http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163352">http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163352</a> </span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(* A K)</span></p> <p>South African, European demining experts killed in Yemen</p> <p>Five demining experts killed in a weekend explosion in Yemen were from South Africa and several European countries, a Saudi-run organisation in charge of the project said Monday.</p> <p>The state-run King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSRelief) said two South Africans, a Croatian, a Bosnian and a Kosovan were killed Sunday when a vehicle carrying mines to be destroyed exploded in the central province of Marib.</p> <p>A British national was injured in the explosion, KSRelief said without naming the casualties.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6615555/South-African-European-demining-experts-killed-Yemen.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6615555/South-African-European-demining-experts-killed-Yemen.html</a> </span></p> <p><span>(B P)</span></p> <p>When people do a seminar, conference, or whatever event on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a>, you would think organizers would be sensible enough to include at least one Yemeni, even if for props (sarcastic here).

The peace consultations – which took place in Sweden and were mediated by the United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths – followed international pressure for a ceasefire that began in October and intensified through November.</p> <p>Rifts between Saudi Arabia and its most important ally, the United States, over the former’s intervention in the Yemen conflict appeared to deepen last month with the announced <a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6712#refueling">end of US in-flight refueling for Saudi-led military coalition aircraft </a><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6712#refueling">operating over Yemen</a>, and a vote in the <a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6712#us-congress">US Senate to debate a bill to suspend military assistance to the coalition</a>. Various governments in <a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6712#eu-embargo">Europe also took steps toward banning arms sales to members of the coalition</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6712#unsc-resolution">United Nations Security Council (UNSC) member states began negotiating a new draft resolution</a><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6712#unsc-resolution"> related to the Yemen conflict</a> in November, calling for measures to de-escalate the war and address the humanitarian crisis. This was the first proposed UNSC resolution related to Yemen since April 2015. Lobbying from Saudi Arabia and the United States, however, appeared to postpone any vote on the text at least until after the negotiations in Sweden.</p> <p>In Yemen, the domestic currency rebounded sharply in value against the US dollar in November after a steep collapse in the months previous. While this had the potential to help mitigate the humanitarian crisis, most of the benefits of the Yemeni rial’s recovery were absorbed before they reached consumers. Acting as a cartel to manipulate the currency market, <a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6712#rial">money exchangers profited significantly from the Yemeni rial’s appreciation</a> and most <a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6712#prices">commercial retailers refused to lower prices</a> to match the rial’s recovery.

A <a href="https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/PB194-National-Dialogues.pdf">national dialogue</a> is a grassroots mechanism for identifying reforms to prevent or end war; however, these proposals may conflict with elite interests, preventing their implementation.

First, disagreements over a federal government undermined the <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/27/the-non-conclusion-of-yemens-national-dialogue/">last national dialogue</a>.

Even in an organization such as Human Rights Watch, that spans time zones across the globe, people don’t usually call at that hour unless it’s urgent. Incoming from Australia, four hours ahead of Bangkok, confirmed my suspicion. Can you talk to a young Saudi woman at the airport being held by Thai officials?</p> <p>[…]</p> <p>The Canadian government stepped in to bring Rahaf to Canada quickly because her father and brother were in Bangkok trying to get access to her, and she feared these two since she held them responsible for the physical and psychological abuse she had suffered in Saudi Arabia. Only when I saw the photos of Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland greeting her in Toronto did I believe that Rahaf was truly safe.</p> <p>The drama of Rahaf’s pleas via Twitter, her determination and courage, and the photos and videos of her barricade to save herself made her an Internet phenomenon that may be hard to recreate. But the surge of support she received from social media around the world shows that tapping global support is possible and can be decisive in prompting media and policy-makers to care – and to act. But sadly, this won’t be the last such desperate case.

Especially education reforms. It’s one the president and<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/world/middleeast/saudi-mbs-jared-kushner.html"> Jared Kushner</a> are either totally uninterested in or too<a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/03/21/jared-kushner-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman/"> compromised</a> to learn from.</p> <p>Upon the death of Saudi Arabia’s founder, King Abdulaziz in 1953, his eldest-surviving son Saud ascended to the throne. Saud’s brother Faisal, the former foreign minister, was appointed crown prince as well as his brother’s prime minister. The kingdom was now awash in oil money and Saud ruled like his father did: By doling out favors to his tribal allies. Massive government-sponsored construction projects were launched to solidify his rule. To his detriment, Saud neglected to enact any fiscal policy at all.</p> <p>The Middle East of 1953 was already shaping up to be part of the Cold War chessboard and America was looking for allies. Saudi Arabia’s place as a major energy supplier was a given, but more was needed in light of the rise of Pan Arabism under Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser. The U.S. chose to elevate its relationship with the Saudis within the Eisenhower Doctrine by using the religiously conservative kingdom as a regional counterweight to Nasser. Saud wholeheartedly embraced this role. His government’s unregulated spending and lack of fiscal policy, however, concerned the State Department enough to place conditions on military aid. Saudi Arabia had to modernize its inefficient government bureaucracy.</p> <p>Into the mix came the Ford Foundation. Dedicated to its mission of improving humanity through democratic principles, the Ford Foundation was interested in modernization projects within the U.S.’s Third World allies. The reforms Saudi Arabia needed were their specialty. A representative from Ford’s regional headquarters in Beirut first approached Saud in 1954 and the king was enthusiastic.</p> <p>But he also refused to reign in his spending so Ford’s work had to wait. Faisal, who was Western-educated and had experience running a comparatively modern administration left over by the Ottomans when he was governor of Hejaz, on the Red Sea coast, advocated for a more modern government. A power struggle between the brothers ensued. In 1965, Faisal deposed Saud with the support of the family and was made king.</p> <p>The Ford Foundation’s project began once Faisal consolidated his rule. </p> <p>Solidifying and institutionalizing the House of Saud’s rule was the order of the day. The Ford Foundation’s reform program was the perfect window dressing to mollify the Johnson administration. The quantity of teachers and schools increased nationwide, but the quality of their education did not, as the Wahhabis remained in control of all other aspects of Saudi’s education system. Faisal left curriculum development, textbook production, and overall education policy in their hands – by Kyle Gaffney</p> <p><span><a href="https://thebulwark.com/beware-of-saudis-promising-reform/">https://thebulwark.com/beware-of-saudis-promising-reform/</a> </span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp9 USA</span></h2> <p>Siehe / Look at cp1</p> <p><span>(* B K P)</span></p> <p><span>Film by TYT: </span>Lifting The Veil Of Deception On The #US Role In #Yemen- </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/videos/365193497364156/">https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/videos/365193497364156/</a> </span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p><span>Film: </span>‘We are dissatisfied’: Cory Booker claims U.S. ‘finds it easy’ to drop bombs in Yemen but not take care of veterans</p> <p>U.S. Democratic Sen.

The Task Force is composed of 4,000 specialists in top secret missions, including targeted assassinations by commandos or killer drones, particularly in Yemen and Somalia. While aircraft and helicopters for these special operations take off from Camp Lemonnier, the drones have been concentrated at Chabelley airport, a dozen kilometres from the capital. New hangars are being built there, and the work has been handed by the Pentagon to a company from Catania which is already employed for the work taking place in Sigonella, the main drones base used by the USA and NATO for operations in Africa and the Greater Middle East.</p> <p>There is also a Japanese and a French base in Djibouti, which house German and Spanish troops. A Chinese military base was added in 2017, the only one outside of its national territory. </p> <p>This is an essentially economic presence, to which the United States and other Western powers oppose a growing military presence. This accounts for the intensification of operations led by AfriCom (US Command for Africa), which has two important subordinate Commands in Italy – the US Army Africa, at the Ederle de Vicence barracks ; the US Naval Forces Europe-Africa, whose headquarters is at the Capodichino base in Naples, composed of the warships of the Sixth Fleet based in Gaeta.</p> <p>In the same strategic infrastructure is another US base for armed drones, which is under construction in Agadez, Niger, where the Pentagon already uses air base 101 in Niamey for drones</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/video-great-game-military-bases-africa/5665757">https://www.globalresearch.ca/video-great-game-military-bases-africa/5665757</a></span></p> <p><span>and film (in Italien): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXkcvtPlhow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXkcvtPlhow</a> </span></p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p>McGovern Introduces Bill to Prohibit Saudi Arms Sales and Military Aid</p> <p>Today, Congressman James P.

Eisern schweigt die TAGESSCHAU. Das zentrale Nachrichten-Instrument der ARD tut so als wäre nichts. Doch Ladislaus Ludescher vom Germanistischen Seminar der Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg hat diese Grabesstille kühl und wissenschaftlich dokumentiert: In seiner Langzeitstudie "Vergessene Welten" mit Daten zur Berichterstattung der Tagesschau im Jahr 2018 stellt er nach einer Auswertung von 4.000 Tagesschau-Sendungen fest: "Dass sich in der wichtigsten Nachrichtensendung im deutschsprachigen Raum, die täglich durchschnittlich von bis zu 10 Mio. Zuschauern verfolgt wird und für viele Menschen zu einem nicht unerheblichen Teil die politische Wahrnehmung der Welt bestimmt, die Berichterstattung stark auf den sog. Westen und Nahen Osten konzentriert, wodurch zahlreiche blinde Flecken entstehen. - Dazu gehört die von den Vereinten Nationen als aktuell schlimmste humanitäre Krise der Welt bezeichnete Situation im von Cholera und Hunger geprägten Bürgerkriegsland Jemen."</p> <p>Dass die saudischen Kindersoldaten im Jemen nicht selten mit dem deutschen Export-Schlager, dem Gewehr G3 von Heckler &amp; Koch ausgerüstet sind, ist kommt in der TAGESSCHAU nicht vor. Auch der Bau einer Waffenfabrik nach deutschem Muster im finsteren Königreich wird von der ARD-Nachrichten-Schleuder konsequent beschwiegen. Die staatseigene saudische Rüstungsfirma MIC produziert dort das deutsche Sturmgewehr G-36 in Lizenz. Heckler &amp; Koch ist in einer Lage, in der öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit eher stören könnte. </p> <p>Obwohl in den Staatsverträgen der öffentlich-rechtlichen Sender nicht verankert ist, dass sie nur das senden, was der jeweiligen Regierung genehm ist, handeln sie doch so.

Fast vier Jahre nach dem Beginn der saudi-arabischen Offensive gegen vermeintlich vom Iran unterstützte Rebellen droht Millionen Menschen in dem Bürgerkriegsland der Hungertod.Deutsche Waffen befeuern das Leid der Zivilbevölkerung – sehr zum Unmut der Kirchen, die heftig protestieren.</p> <p>So bewilligte der Bundessicherheitsrat unter Führung von Kanzlerin Angela Merkel allein im vergangenen Jahr Waffenausfuhren nach Saudi-Ara­bien im Wert von deutlich über 400 Millionen Euro. Im Vorjahr waren es rund 250 Millionen Euro. Auch andere am Krieg beteiligte Staaten wie die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate, Bahrain, Kuwait und Ägypten werden von Deutschland aus munter weiter beliefert. </p> <p>Linken-Politikerin Sevim Dagdelen sprach daher jüngst von „einer moralischen Bankrotterklärung der Bundesregierung“. Das sehen auch die beiden großen Kirchen ähnlich. Im Dezember kritisierte Karl Jüsten, der katholische Co-Vorsitzende der Gemeinsamen Konferenz Kirche und Entwicklung (GKKE), die Regierung scharf. Mit ihrer Politik trage sie zur humanitären Katastrophe im Jemen bei und fördere „den Bruch des Völkerrechts“. </p> <p>Den vom Bund nach dem Mord an dem Journalisten Jamal Kashoggi verkündeten, auf zwei Monate befristeten Lieferstopp für Rüstungsexporte nach Saudi-Ara­bien kommentierte Jüsten fast schon zynisch. „Im Ernst: Der Bundesregierung musste schon vor dem Fall Kashoggi bekannt gewesen sein, mit wem sie es in Saudi-Arabien zu tun hat.“</p> <p>Offensichtlich stehen in der Rüstungsexportpolitik weiter wirtschaftliche Interessen an erster Stelle. So bezeichnete Wirtschaftsminister Peter Altmaier einen deutschen Exportstopp Ende 2018 als wenig sinnvoll: Wenn Deutschland keine Waffen mehr liefere, würden sofort „andere Länder diese Lücke füllen“. </p> <p>Tatsächlich stiegen die Waffen­importe im Nahen Osten nach Angaben des Friedensforschungsinstituts Sipri von 2013 bis 2017 im Vergleich zu den Vorjahren um satte 103 Prozent. </p> <p><a href="https://www.katholische-sonntagszeitung.de/Im-Blickpunkt/Deutschland-verdient-am-Leid-Samstag-19.-Januar-2019-10-14-00">https://www.katholische-sonntagszeitung.de/Im-Blickpunkt/Deutschland-verdient-am-Leid-Samstag-19.-Januar-2019-10-14-00</a></p> <p>(A P)</p> <p><span>Erklärungen des Auswärtigen Amts in der Regierungspressekonferenz vom 18.01.2019</span></p> <p>FRAGE TOWFIGH NIA: Herr Burger, gibt es schon konkrete Ergebnisse, was die Jemen-Konferenz und die Implementierung der Stockholmer Vereinbarung betrifft?</p> <p>Burger (AA): Worum es bei der Veranstaltung am Mittwoch im Auswärtigen Amt ging, war, internationale Partner und regionale Schlüsselakteure zusammenzubringen, um die Rolle, die die Vereinten Nationen bei der Umsetzung des Waffenstillstands und der vertrauensbildenden Maßnahmen haben, zu unterstützen. Dazu hat die Koordinatorin der Vereinten Nationen für den Jemen, Frau Grande, einen Fonds aufgelegt, die sogenannte Peace Support Facility, die helfen soll, die in Stockholm getroffenen Vereinbarungen rasch umzusetzen.

Prior to the exhibition, inaugurated by the EP president Antonio Tajani, a seminar was held, co-chaired by the chairwoman of the National Federal Council of the UAE Amal Abdullah al-Qubaisi and Antonio Isturiz White, a Spanish conservative MEP and the chair of the EP friendship group with the UAE.</p> <p>More than an attempt to inform and engage in a substantive discussion on UAE policies, the event was part of the UAE lobbying campaign in Europe. What made it different from other similar events was the vehicle chosen. Instead of bashing the perceived UAE foes, such as Qatar, Iran, Turkey, and the Muslim Brotherhood, the event emphasized a positive agenda: UAE humanitarian aid in crisis-stricken places, such as Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia, and even in Europe through funding of refugee camps in Greece.</p> <p>Yet there are limits to how much even a well-funded and sophisticated PR operation can accomplish.</p> <p>To begin with, the venue chosen for the meeting already raised suspicions. It was the EP-UAE “friendship group,” not an official EP body, like the foreign affairs committee, or the delegation for relations with the Arabian Peninsula countries.</p> <p>Furthermore, the image of the UAE as a humanitarian superpower is undermined by the harsh realities on the ground.</p> <p>At the event, for instance, the EU commissioner for humanitarian aid, Chrystos Stylianides, repeatedly praised, in a surreal fashion, the “common values” supposedly linking the EU and UAE. At the same time, Emirati human rights defender Ahmed Mansour <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/uae-activist-mansoor-loses-final-appeal-10-year-sentence-181231111647858.html">lost his appeal</a> of a 10-year prison sentence for exercising his right to free speech. </p> <p>There are more gaps between the UAE words and actions. For all the talk of support for migrants and refugees outside its borders, the UAE <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/commentary-migrant-labour-abuse-makes-dubai-a-questionable-tourist-destination">treats</a> its own migrant workers harshly, even by Gulf standards. </p> <p>One of the cornerstones of the UAE lobbying strategy is to portray the country as a modern, moderate, and socially liberal society in contrast to its regional “Islamist” foes. Nothing works better to impress Western audiences than showcasing progress on women rights.</p> <p>Such events are more likely to entrench the positions of those who are already inclined to do Emerati bidding than to win new converts to the cause.

He tried to give an image strong coalition in control of the situation, that has prevented the Yemeni Army from acquiring any military equipment, but at the same time he had to admit Yemeni Armed Forces possession of advanced technology in these drones. Facts are beyond can't be denied; the drones have targeted a couple of Saudi areas and resulted in the death of some high rank commanders.</p> <p>In another contradiction, which exposes the state of confusion the aggression is living through, the aggression claims that its latest airstrikes in Sana'a are meant to destroy drones manufacturing sites.

In addition, the president’s house, where the training camp was located, was subjected to airstrikes.</p> <p>At the same time, Houthis-controlled broadcaster Almasirah reported that the coalition aircraft had stricken a food factory in the north of Sanaa, adding that residential buildings were damaged as a result of the attack. </p> <p><span><a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201901201071642231-saudi-led-coalition-attacks-sanaa/">https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201901201071642231-saudi-led-coalition-attacks-sanaa/</a> </span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(A K pS)</span></p> <p>Arab coalition announces a qualitative military operation in Sanaa and warns civilians</p> <p>The Saudi-led Arab coalition said Saturday that it would launch a qualitative military operation in the capital, Sanaa, under the control of al-Houthi militants.</p> <p>"The operation is targeting an integrated network of Drones aerial, capabilities and logistic facilities," the coalition said in a statement by it's spokesman Col.
