Last month's peace talks in Sweden raised hopes that the tide had finally turned in a nation battered by nearly four years of civil war and the ensuing famine, with three-quarters of the population dependent on humanitarian assistance. But the truce and prisoner swaps promised in December have yet to materialise.</p> <p>Much of the pressure of late has been on the Saudis and the Western-backed coalition.

Rather, it has already been pushed into the abyss and therein continues to fall. After four years of war, Yemen has suffered the destruction of its infrastructure, economy, social fabric, and much more. Yemenis are a nation traumatized by human loss and starvation. In the past year, photos of malnourished children have become synonymous with Yemen worldwide. Yet, as much as it deserved the media attention, the story of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis at times concealed the fact that this is not a natural disaster that has befallen Yemen. It is an accumulation of political conflicts within the country, exacerbated by reckless regional interference backed by the world’s Western powers.</p> <p>Aid organizations are now preparing for another year of humanitarian suffering. The United Nations has announced plans to raise funds amounting to $US4 billion – a third more than last year’s appeal for roughly US$3 billion – with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates funding about a third of the appeal. However, humanitarian organizations are reaching their capacity limits, while the immense looting and confiscation of humanitarian supplies in which belligerent parties are engaged means aid itself is at times helping to finance the war instead of reaching those in need. Neither the coalition powers nor the Western countries backing them should therefore content themselves with pouring aid into Yemen. Yemen desperately needs political decisions to be made.</p> <p>At a closer look, developments last year demonstrated clearly that the crisis in Yemen is political at its core, and that’s how it needs to be addressed. It was new geopolitical dynamics that encouraged decisions to contain Yemen’s downward spiral toward the end of 2018 – even if decisions came late, unexpectedly, and at times resulted from events that on face value had little relation to the Yemen conflict.</p> <p>At the epicenter of the conflict and its shifting dynamics were the city of Hudaydah and the nearby ports – the last access Houthi forces have left to the Red Sea. These ports are also the entry point for most of the basic commodities feeding a nation descending into mass famine. For some two years the Saudi-led military coalition has been pushing for a military campaign to take Hudaydah. However, international concern – that cargo shipments would be interrupted and trigger a humanitarian catastrophe – has been intense, and the coalition was waiting for a green light from its main backers, the United States and the United Kingdom, to pursue the offensive. Near the midpoint of 2018, Washington gave what amounted to a “yellow light”, according to a US government official who spoke with the Sana’a Center at the time.</p> <p>The strategic and military preparations for the campaign changed the calculations of various groups in the anti-Houthi coalition. For instance, the UAE had for the past several years built proxy militias in areas the Yemeni government is meant to control, with these militias often challenging the government’s authority and some seeking to partition the country. In 2018, however, unity among anti-Houthi ground forces was seen as paramount for the battle for Hudaydah. With UAE prompting, these disparate groups closed ranks and put differences aside for the military campaign. Symbolic of this were the visits to Abu Dhabi by Yemeni President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi and Islah party leaders in 2018.</p> <p>Through the latter half of 2018, the coalition’s efforts to drive the Houthis from Hudaydah progressed slowly and effectively stalled at the southern edge of the city, threatening to become a battle of attrition. Simultaneously, international pressure was building on Saudi Arabia – pressure that was then key to facilitating the UN-led peace consultations in Sweden and the Stockholm Agreement that halted the battle for Hudaydah. It was, however, not the possible starvation of millions of Yemenis that created the international momentum for peace consultations and a ceasefire. Rather, it was the media spectacle around the murder of one man, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, at his country’s consulate in Istanbul that provoked international outcry and prompted Washington and London to force Riyadh’s hand. Many Western leaders had been growing increasingly uncomfortable over reckless Saudi foreign policy and were embarrassed by reports of war crimes in Yemen committed by their ally, including bombing buses full of school children and siege tactics that have helped push the country toward mass starvation. However, while Western countries, above all the US and the UK, had enabled the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, they had no hand in Khashoggi’s murder, which allowed for an opportunity to criticize Riyadh while claiming the moral high ground.</p> <p>The Stockholm Agreement, endorsed by the UN Security Council, came about thanks to international pressure, Saudi influence over the Yemeni government and the belligerent parties each wanting to avoid blame for the peace process’ failure. At the same time both sides were hoping to gain an advantage. The UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths secured the warring parties’ commitments not through compromise, but by watering down the language in the deal to the point that what the parties actually committed to is widely up to their own discretion. In the short time it has been since the talks, it is apparent the parties are interpreting their commitments quite differently. Neither regarded the talks as a stepping stone to a greater accord, but rather a localized accommodation.</p> <p>President Hadi – technically still a ‘transitional president’ who was meant to leave office in 2014 – also knows his exit from power is almost assured if and when a peace deal is signed. Hadi’s choice to send a delegation to Sweden was, however, not his to make, given that he is beholden to his Saudi patrons. Indeed, Hadi has attempted to govern his country from Riyadh since 2015. The armed Houthi movement likewise attended the talks under duress. Their leadership is keenly aware that the greatest “victory” they could possibly achieve at this point is to survive. The pummeling Houthi forces have been sustaining on the battlefield has left them smarting and looking for a way to ease the pressure.</p> <p>There is, however, little to no chance that the Houthis will cede a military defeat to their opponents. And while they have been militarily pressured, in the territories they control they have acted increasingly paranoid and continued to craft their own police state: persecuting minorities, staging show trials and executions, banning civil society groups and launching arrest campaigns to purge undesirables – such as free-thinking journalists, human rights advocates and others – institutionalizing the extortion of businesses, workers and aid organizations, conscripting children into combat roles, and propagating religious zealotry upon the masses. Before the Houthis took over, there was more than 20 daily and weekly independent newspapers publishing from Sana’a. Today, there are only Houthi publications. Meanwhile, the ongoing war also pushed them closer to Tehran, which is ironic given that Saudi Arabia and the UAE launched their military intervention in Yemen to prevent what they saw as Iranian encroachment in their backyard.</p> <p>Thus, the war has become increasingly complex as it has proceeded, entrenching the clout of warlords and armed groups as it goes and advancing the country’s fragmentation. This trend is likely to continue in the absence of a broader settlement to end the conflict. The details of what a political settlement would look like remain elusive, but some of the parameters are clear.</p> <p>[a very detailed review]</p> <p><span><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6808">http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6808</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p> <p><strong>About 19 million lack access to clean water in Yemen</strong></p> <p><span>Abdu Mohammed Yousuf, 23 years old, one of Al-Dumman village residents, located in the north of Bajil district of al-Hodeidah coastal province 'west of Yemen', rides a donkey cart for over 20 Km daily to get drinking water for his family that consists of 9 members five of them are female and four are male, the youngest of them is 3 years old.</span></p> <p>Ridding a local made donkey cart, the black skin Abdu Yousuf transfers 12 gallons from his home to a water well located 20 Km away of his home and back to his home daily under the heat of the burning sun.</p> <p>Among long ques, the young Abdu Yousuf waits his turn to fill his gallons with drinking water from a well that was dug and equipped by a wealthy citizen.</p> <p>"I come here every four days to get safe drinking water," Abdu Yousuf told the Center of Yemen Humanitarian Relief and Development Organization (MONA) during a tour of the region.</p> <p>"Sometimes I wait three hours until my turn comes," says Abdu Yusuf.</p> <p>"The pumping of water into our house from the state water project has stopped because of the war that broke out and the lack of diesel," said Abdu Yousuf.</p> <p>Over 15 thousands capita from al-Dumman and al-Habil villages benefit from the well that was provided by a wealthy citizen.</p> <p>"Our situations were better before the war", "We suffer so much now that we go long distances to get water," says young Abdu Yousuf.</p> <p>The total of renewable water sources in Yemen, according to the UN Water Statistics Report 2010, is estimated at 3.4 billion cubic meters a year, 900 million of which are covered by aquifers. Each year groundwater levels decrease from 1-7 m, with scarcity of recharge due to drought seasons. Thus, water consumption rates exceed natural recharge enormously.</p> <p>The Yemeni per capita water rate, per year, is 130 cubic meters, while the international water rate per capita is 7500 cubic meters per year.</p> <p>According to international organizations, Yemen is one of the most fragile countries in the world in terms of water security. It is possible to take advantage of sea water and desalinate it, but the cost is high for a relatively poor country such as Yemen.</p> <p>An officer in charge stands on the water well to organize long queues of donkey carts.

In an email obtained by <em>Just Security</em>, the Saudi embassy failed to accept responsibility for the strike, and claimed that MSF had made an “error” in “not officially informing the Coalition of the new treatment facility’s location.” In fact, MSF asserted that it had notified the Saudi Coalition of the coordinates of the cholera treatment center <em>twelve</em>times.</p> <p>The Saudi-led coalition recently reported its internal assessment of the incident, an investigation required by international humanitarian law.</p> <p>The report repeatedly attempts to shift the blame for the strike to MSF. The JIAT asserts that, after reviewing the satellite imagery, it did not find any signs of distinction on the warehouse before the strike. (A claim contradicted, as Ryan Goodman earlier <span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/58437/saudis-deceptive-email-congress-bombing-msf-cholera-hospital/">noted</a></span>, by a researcher with the well-respected investigative group Bellingcat, who <span><a href="https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/1007014499352809472?lang=en">found</a></span> that, “Geolocation — and therefore satellite imagery — of the cholera treatment center shows that the red crescent logos were even visible from space.”)</p> <p>Nonetheless, the JIAT at points cryptically appears to <span><a href="http://www.alriyadhdaily.com/article/812807e44f9a47ddbfe1bbd99be1cd0c">admit</a></span> mistakes. It states that “it became clear that the mission was based on information from a source inside Yemen, and that it did not complete the necessary procedures used by the Coalition Forces.” </p> <p>If that is true—if the coalition forces rushed to carry out the strike and therefore failed to “complete the necessary procedures used by the Coalition Forces”—then this may be a clear incidence of an international humanitarian law violation. The JIAT, however, does not accept that responsibility. In closing, it recommends that “Coalition States provide <em>voluntary</em> assistance for physical damages to the warehouse” (emphasis added). But if the strike was taken with insufficient precautions, as the JIAT seems to admit, then the assistance would be mandatory, not voluntary.</p> <p>The recent JIAT report on the June attack raises real questions, however, about the willingness of the coalition to ensure that its air strikes are in compliance with international humanitarian law—and about the willingness of the coalition to carry out effective investigations of incidents when they do occur. </p> <p>The failure of the coalition to properly vet a targeting location not only implicates the coalition forces in a possible violation of international humanitarian law. It also implicates the U.S. in a <span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/55415/common-article-1-u-s-duty-ensure-respect-geneva-conventions-yemen/">possible violation</a></span> as well. Common Article 1 of the Geneva Conventions, after all, provides that states have an obligation not only to respect, but to “ensure respect” of the Conventions. If the United States is supporting the coalition which it knows to be carrying out strikes that violate international humanitarian law, the United States could be violating its own Common Article 1 obligation to “ensure respect” of international humanitarian law – by Oona Hathaway</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/62363/saudi-coalition-admission-error-bombing-cholera-treatment-center-implicates-united-states/">https://www.justsecurity.org/62363/saudi-coalition-admission-error-bombing-cholera-treatment-center-implicates-united-states/</a></span></p> <p>My comment: There are many dozens of such cases.</p> <p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p> <p><strong>Inside the Largest Known U.S. Special Forces Ground Raid in Yemen | "Targeting Yemen" | FRONTLINE</strong></p> <p>FRONTLINE’s Safa Al Ahmad goes to the site of the largest known U.S. special forces ground raid in Yemen to investigate the escalation of the U.S. fight against Al Qaeda.</p> <p><span>In “Targeting Yemen,” a new documentary that airs Jan. 22, correspondent Safa Al Ahmad returns to Yemen amid an ongoing war to report on American ground raids and drone strikes that have targeted Al Qaeda.

In the conduct of operations, U.S. forces “employ a variety of measures to reduce civilian casualties —from operational design to account for where civilians are located on the battlefield to steps taken to mitigate weapon effects on civilians who find themselves near potential targets, such as enemy forces. Lessons we learn in the conduct of operations are used to improve our practices to reduce civilian casualties.”</p> <p>On the U.S. Role in Yemen</p> <p>“The United States is committed to finding and striking AQAP’s terrorist network in Yemen,” it said. “U.S. forces conducted multiple ground operations and more than 120 strikes in 2017 to remove key leaders and disrupt the ability of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS-Yemen to use ungoverned spaces in Yemen as a hub for terrorist recruiting, training, and base of operations to export terrorism worldwide.”</p> <p>U.S. forces, the DOD said, “are advising and assisting regional counterterrorism partners in the fight against AQAP and ISIS in Yemen. U.S. forces have provided our partners with intelligence support; airborne ISR; advice and assistance with operational planning; maritime interdiction and security operations; medical support; and aerial refueling in their efforts to degrade and destroy AQAP and ISIS-Y.”</p> <p>“It is in our national security interests to pursue violent extremist organizations like AQAP and ISIS-Y that have attacked U.S. forces and interests in the region and abroad in order to degrade their ability to conduct further attacks.

At the time, Women secured thirty percent representation in the NDC and took part in the Constitution Drafting Committee, for the first time in Yemen’s history ensuring a thirty percent in any future committee formation.</p> <p>Yet today, in the conflict resolution process, Yemeni women are almost without any political power at all. Yemeni women today face the same marginalization of other groups such as the youth and southern secessionist movement who are also absent from the negotiation table. Women, however, are doubly excluded as they face gender-based marginalization.</p> <p>For more than a decade, Yemen has been the lowest-ranking country in the Global Gender Index, with a gender gap estimated today to be <span><a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2018.pdf">ninety percent or more</a></span>.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Yemeni women’s political activism has continued and received the support of the international community. The UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths (and his predecessors, Jamal Ben Omar and Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed) have ensured women’s political participation in peacebuilding processes through <span><a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/10/yemeni-women-call-for-their-inclusion-in-peace-efforts">creative ways</a></span>, in order to apply .

In addition to questioning the cohesiveness of government and rebel forces, it anecdotally details the rise of a robust, mafia-like war economy that creates disincentives for peace on both sides. The panel’s conclusions include a new, particularly damning assessment of Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi’s government and its local affiliates, while also reiterating extant concerns about the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi rebels.</p> <p>The nearly 300-page document paints a bleak picture, drawing particular attention to the lack of cohesiveness that makes it difficult for either Hadi or the Houthis to decisively win the war, let alone effectively transition to peace. After all, if the disparate factions that make up either side lost the common enemy that binds them together, they may well fracture into opposing forces, creating a series of small civil wars across the country.</p> <p>On one side, the Hadi government is unable to exert authority over the areas it claims to control, its repeated non-payment of salaries has contributed to troop discontent, and it faces intense and often violent opposition by some southern forces. On the other side, Houthi forces are a similarly loose collective linked together more by a set of common adversaries than common interests. The panel suggests there are “signs” that the Houthis are becoming less politically inclusive in their leadership ranks—a fact that likely exacerbates the broader lack of cohesion. Indeed, the panel notes that the Houthis are “facing slightly increasing levels of dissent” from major tribes and at the street level. Recruitment has reportedly taken a hit due to a currency crisis that caused food prices to rise, and the practice of offering low pay to hungry, poor, often illiterate young recruits is hardly a recipe for close-knit forces.</p> <p>WAR ECONOMY AND CORRUPTION</p> <p>Coupled with the lack of cohesiveness, various destabilizing factors in Yemen have led to the development of a significant war economy. Inevitably, those who benefit from this economy are far less inclined to facilitate a transition to peace, and they could act as spoilers if their interests are threatened. These elements include many important stakeholders in the north and south, some with roles in Houthi or Hadi governing structures. </p> <p>For example, to finance the war effort, the Houthis rely on rents and fees in Sana that the government used to collect. According to last year’s panel report, this revenue totaled at least 407 billion Yemeni riyals ($1.6 billion). Moreover, they collect import taxes at Hodeida and al-Salif ports, and at a checkpoint in Dhamar province through which nearly all of the country’s imports pass, even those originating from entry points not under Houthi control.</p> <p>The panel also notes that the Houthis make significant sums by taxing oil donated by Iran—perhaps tens of millions of dollars per month. The oil is imported through Hodeida with falsified paperwork suggesting an origin in the United Arab Emirates or Oman, though the true origin is Iran. This allows vessels to avert detection by the coalition or UN maritime monitors.</p> <p>In addition to funding the Houthi war effort, the war economy has created ample opportunities for corruption on both sides of the conflict. The Hadi government and its local affiliates are particularly taken to task in this year’s panel report. The previous two reports used the word “corruption” only once, but this new edition uses it over twenty times—eight times in direct relation to the government, two in relation to the Houthis, and at least nine in relation to both. The panel assesses that corruption is contributing to the humanitarian crisis by artificially raising prices and impeding the import of commercial goods.</p> <p>At the same time, however, the panel notes that the Houthis are less reliant on Iran supplying whole weapons systems, suggesting that they are now assembling some systems locally and looking abroad only when they need “high-value components.” – by Elana DeLozier</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/in-damning-report-un-panel-details-war-economy-in-yemen">https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/in-damning-report-un-panel-details-war-economy-in-yemen</a></span></p> <p>My comment: By an US think tank with close ties to the Israel lobby (<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Institute_for_Near_East_Policy#Criticism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Institute_for_Near_East_Policy#Criticism</a></span> ), nevertheless, in this article, bias is limited.</p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>«The Invisible Killer»...

The city of Aden and its surrounding areas have undergone the control of the UAE forces as part of the Arab coalition forces that are waging war in Yemen with the aim of entrusting the legitimate government to regain control of the land and end the coup d'état carried out by the Houthi rebels, according to the stated objectives of the Coalition.</p> <p>According to the report, instead of the relative stability the city was supposed to see in preparation for the return of the legitimate government, the opposite occurred, the security situation deteriorated, and the city of Aden was ravaged by a wave of assassinations believed to be of a systematic and organized nature, targeting certain segments of the military and security and civilians, by systematic means, "which put a number of questions about how the assassinations were carried out, and the dubious silence of the security services and forces in control of Aden, even for issuing a statement explaining what is going on in Aden, and the beneficiaries of these assassinations that targeted even the first man in the province Maj.

The military came fourth with eight people, followed by leaders and members of the resistance, with seven people, in addition to a variety of 14 people, including activists, athletes, professors, judges, and prosecutors.</p> <p>Sam confirmed in her report that the wave of assassinations began immediately after the war, and then continued</p> <p><span><a href="http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163551">http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163551</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Trump’s Yemen Problem</strong></p> <p>On Yemen, the Trump administration has tied the worst humanitarian disaster in the world to stopping the spread of Iranian influence. The crisis in Yemen was not the focus of Pompeo’s <span><a href="http://bit.ly/2szvbXP">Cairo speech</a></span> on January 10, where he mentioned Iran at least two dozen times, including the promise “to expel every last Iranian boot” from Syria. Pompeo did express support for UN efforts to achieve peace in war-torn Yemen, but announced no special US diplomatic initiative toward that end.</p> <p>Trump has made clear his own focus on Iran in his rare statements on Yemen. “The country of Iran,” an official White House release explained, “is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen… On the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave.” </p> <p>Iran certainly supports the Houthis in Yemen, but there is no need to exaggerate its support. </p> <p>The House, now with a Democratic majority, is poised to push the measure again, likely to be taken up relatively soon after the federal government shutdown ends. Trump will most likely veto any measure to end US support for the Saudi war in Yemen that passes both chambers. Given the numbers, a successful veto override is very much in question.</p> <p>Such an outcome would be an embarrassment for the Trump administration, and a further impediment to its larger approach to the region.</p> <p>The administration’s much-touted Middle East Security Alliance (MESA)—the closest thing to a Trump doctrine—first emerged during the president’s first visit overseas—to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) presented Trump with an Arab, Islamic, American conference to showcase his ability to bring Arab and Islamic countries together behind what he considered to be mutual national security interests.</p> <p>MESA, sometimes referred to as the Arab NATO, springs from the notion, jointly held by Saudi Arabia and the Trump administration, that Iran is responsible for much of the trouble in the Middle East and that it must be countered by land, sea, and air.</p> <p>Yemen has thus become a footnote in this grand design and a pawn for regional rivalries. The conflict in Yemen remains a stubborn one, at least as far as a military resolution is concerned. </p> <p>In the final analysis, the Trump administration, by giving MbS a pass on Khashoggi’s murder and refusing to press Saudi Arabia on the killing of civilians in Yemen, is giving Saudis the impression that they could continue indefinitely with their attempts to defeat the Houthis with US support. </p> <p>The MESA idea, unrealistic though it may be, is further <span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/09/iran-yemen-saudi-arabia/571465/">encouragement</a></span> for the Arab coalition to seek victory on the battlefield rather than a diplomatic solution.

Yemen’s health officials estimate that 80 percent of those with H1N1 risk death owing to the lack of medication available and Yemen’s devastated health infrastructure.</p> <p>Mohammed, a father of three, died last Friday, overcome by the symptoms of the swine flu virus, two days after being treated in al-Azal’s intensive care unit. Issam Al-Harazi, Data Officer for epidemiological surveillance at Yemen’s Ministry of Health, told MintPress News that al-Rajwai died as a result of a viral infection of his respiratory system, likely caused by the H1N1 (swine flu) virus, which affected the cells of his nasal mucosa, throat and lungs, and then moved to the rest of his body.</p> <p>The spokesman for the Ministry of Health and Population in Sana’a, Yousef al-Hathari, told MintPress that there have been a total 418 suspected H1N1 cases in and around the province of Sana’a and in northern Yemen over the past two months alone, and 86 people have died from the virus — though al-Hathari suspects the number of deaths to be higher, as many cases go unreported.</p> <p>Al-Hathari went on to say that this week health centers had received “46 cases of swine flu in the secretariat of the capital, Amran, and Ibb provinces, and 11 deaths,” which means the virus is likely beginning its spread across the region.</p> <p>In fact, according to Yemen’s Health Ministry, the virus is spreading rapidly in many of Yemen’s provinces. Al-Hathari explained that “in winter the incidence of influenza is already high and the climate is conducive to the spread of the virus.” If the virus continues to spread among Yemen’s vulnerable population, it could cause another major health disaster in a country already grappling with a cholera epidemic, especially in the absence of vaccines and treatment exacerbated by the Saudi-led coalition’s crippling blockade.</p> <p>H1NI, colloquially known as the Swine Flu, is a subtype of the common influenza virus prevalent among pigs, but transmission of the virus from animals to humans is rare and does not always lead to human infection. However, when it does develop in humans, it carries a significantly higher risk of fatality than the common flu.</p> <p>The death of Mohammed al-Rajwai, a public-sector worker, has sparked fear in Sana’a that the virus will spread, especially considering the compromised state of Yemen’s health infrastructure owing to the ongoing war and the blockade that has been imposed by Saudi-led coalition.</p> <p>“We are living in an environment infested with all kinds of viruses thanks to the war,” said Fahd Assad, a father of four whose sons are still recovering from cholera. “Now I am afraid of swine influenza, God help us.” Assad lives in the district of Dares, an overpopulated slum north of the capital with a high population density, including refugees who fled from violence in nearby Hodeida, Hajjah and Sa’ada.</p> <p>The Saudi-imposed war on Yemen has marked a turning point. Before it began in 2015, outsiders seldom gathered in big cities like Sana’a, limiting the spread of infectious diseases such as influenza. Indeed, some rural residents could live for years without exposure to many of the infections that frequent large cities. But the war has forced people from across rural Yemen to flee to Sana’a seeking shelter from the violence. People from outer provinces are now directly connected – and more liable than ever before to be exposed to the flu and other infectious diseases.</p> <p>Officials in Sana’a told MintPress News that the spread of the H1N1 virus poses a potential for disaster to the population.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Yemen’s hospitals suffer from a lack of life-saving medicines as a result of the Saudi coalition’s imposed siege on the country. Flu cases that could otherwise be treated are leaving patients in critical condition and facing death. Yemen’s health officials estimate that 80 percent of those with H1N1 risk death owing to the lack of medication available and Yemen’s devastated health infrastructure. Officials blame the countries of Saudi-led coalition for the influx of diseases and epidemics that have taken hold in Yemen since the war began.</p> <p>Observers warn of a major health disaster in Yemen if the epidemics continue unabated, and say international health organizations have been slow to respond.</p> <p>Unlike Mohammed al-Rajwai, few patients admitted to local hospitals with suspected H1N1 cases wind up in intensive care. In fact, most people who contract the virus are unable to reach a hospital at all, as so many have been destroyed in the war. For example, in the district of Ahem, a remote area in northern Hajjah province, the single hospital serving the entire region was leveled by Saudi bombs.</p> <p>More than three years of near-constant airstrikes by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have left Yemen’s roads impassable and have turned its hospitals and clinics to rubble, while a ruinous blockade of Yemen’s ports has depleted the country’s supplies of life-saving medicine. The hospitals that have not been destroyed barely function; doctors have not been paid and power outages are frequent.</p> <p>The U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition has repeatedly, systematically and deliberately attacked health facilities in Yemen since it began its military campaign against the country in 2015 – by Ahmed Abdulkareem</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/swine-flu-now-spreading-in-yemen-as-health-system-crumbles-under-saudi-attack/254205/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/swine-flu-now-spreading-in-yemen-as-health-system-crumbles-under-saudi-attack/254205/</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p> <p><strong>Swine Flu, New Threat to Yemenis’ Lives</strong></p> <p>The H1N1 flu, also known as swine flu, is one of the most common epidemics and diseases of recent days among Yemenis.</p> <p>The collapse of the health system due to continued aggression and siege has greatly increased the spread of diseases in Yemen.</p> <p>The Yemeni Ministry of Health recorded more than three hundred cases of swine flu from different Yemeni provinces, while the hospitals in the capital Sana’a recorded the death of more than fifty people infected with the epidemic.</p> <p>Yemeni hospitals suffer from the lack of life-saving medicines because of the siege.

If fighting restarts in earnest around the port of Hodeidah, the main supply route into the country could be cut off, leaving no way to feed millions of people on the verge of starvation.</p> <p>“These coming weeks are make or break for the conflict. We will either see a restart of the political track, or we will likely see a significant military escalation,” said Adam Baron of the European Council for Foreign Relations.</p> <p>The truce itself has largely held in the port of Hodeidah since coming into force a month ago, but late on Wednesday clashes at flashpoints on the city’s edges intensified.</p> <p>And the withdrawal of troops that was meant to take place by Jan. 7 has stalled. Pulling out troops was seen as a pivotal confidence-building measure that would build up the trust needed for political talks.</p> <p>Without it, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres acknowledged last week, “lack of trust” had become a “complicating factor” in trying to get the parties to talk.</p> <p>The agreement also foresees a political track of talks to end the war. But a lack of progress could test the patience of the United Arab Emirates, which leads military operations on Yemen’s Red Sea coast for the Saudi-led coalition.</p> <p>“People are worried that the war will start again after failure in implementing the deal,” said government employee Abdullah Abdul-Bari, a 51-year-old resident of Hodeidah.</p> <p>The Redeployment Coordination Committee had met twice in Houthi-run territory, but attempts to convene a third meeting in areas held by coalition forces failed because the Houthis were unwilling to cross the frontline, sources told Reuters.</p> <p>The Houthis accused Cammaert of bias against them. Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul-Salam said that unless Cammaert’s boss, U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths, dealt with it, “it would be difficult to talk about anything else”.</p> <p>“It is a very fragile moment. People are still politically and rhetorically committed to the Stockholm Agreement as the best way forward. The question is whether we can get tangible progress on the ground,” said International Crisis Group analyst Elizabeth Dickinson.</p> <p>The Arab states show increasing signs of running out of patience. UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash on Wednesday blamed the Houthis’ “obdurate behavior”.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/fear-of-renewed-fighting-hunger-as-yemen-port-troop-pull-out-stalls-idUSKCN1PJ1Y5">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/fear-of-renewed-fighting-hunger-as-yemen-port-troop-pull-out-stalls-idUSKCN1PJ1Y5</a></span></p> <p>(A K pS)</p> <p>Witnesses and source: killing of civilians and wounding of two children by Houthi shelling on Hees city</p> <p>Two civilians were killed and two children injured last night, with artillery shelling by Houthi militants on a house in the city of Hees, south of Hodeidah Province, on Saturday.</p> <p>Witnesses told the Al-Masdar online that the Houthis bombed the city with a number of artillery shells, and one of the shells landed on a house, resulting in civilian casualties belonging to the same family.</p> <p>They noted that the wounded were two children and were severely injured.</p> <p>On the one hand, a government military source said that the Houthi militants are continuously shelling the city under the control of the government forces</p> <p><a href="http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163572">http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163572</a></p> <p>(A K pH)</p> <p>Saudi-led artillery shells areas in Hodeidah</p> <p>The artillery force of the US-backed saudi-led aggression coalition's militias on Saturday shelled areas in the city of Hodeidah, a security official said.<br /> The shelling targeted faculty of Medicine which caused heavy damage</p> <p><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news524364.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news524364.htm</a></p> <p>(A K pH)</p> <p>Citizen Killed in Hodeidah by US-Saudi Artillery Shells</p> <p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=5069&amp;cat_id=1">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=5069&amp;cat_id=1</a></span></p> <p>(* A K P)</p> <p>To help save the Yemen Peace Deal, the international community needs to act now</p> <p>The EU should lead the international community in ensuring that the Yemen Peace Deal is not allowed to collapse</p> <p>All of this now hangs in the balance.</p> <p>Ever since returning from Stockholm, the Houthis have consistently, verifiably, and with callous impunity, violated both the letter and the spirit of the agreement.</p> <p>In a letter to the UN Security Council sent on 15 January 2019, the Coalition to Support Legitimacy in Yemen documented 573 violations of the ceasefire by the Houthis.

Do not forget that the UAE is the mastermind of the Hodeidah crisis – by enforcing the aussault against Hodeidah by their Yemeni anti-Houthi militia (sometimes labeled as “Yemeni forces” or even “Yemeni army” by anti-Houthi propaganda). – Of course, the Hadi government also puts the blame on the Houthis:</p> <p>(A K P)</p> <p>Hodeidah Governor: Houthis Recently Recruited 1,000 Child Soldiers</p> <p>Hodeidah governor al-Hassan Taher accused on Friday Houthi militias of recently deploying around 1,000 child soldiers on the northern front of the Yemeni province.<br /> In a telephone call with Asharq Al-Awsat, the governor said that since the arrival of Dutch General Patrick Cammaert in Hodeidah, “government apparatuses have documented a rising level of violations” of the Stockholm Agreement.<br /> Cammaert chairs the Redeployment Coordination Committee tasked with implementing the provisions of the Swedish agreement struck last month between Yemen’s warring sides.<br /> According to the governor, Houthis are bringing new fighters, mainly about 1,000 children, to the city.<br /> “Militias have also worked on redeploying their fighters in several positions in Hodeidah,” Taher said, adding that lately, Houthis have failed to recruit children from the province and the Tihama region, where residents strongly disapprove of the militias’ plans.</p> <p><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1562721/hodeidah-governor-houthis-recently-recruited-1000-child-soldiers">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1562721/hodeidah-governor-houthis-recently-recruited-1000-child-soldiers</a></p> <p>My comment: Hadi government’s governor.

Unlike the front lines of a conventional battle, she says, drone strikes are unpredictable, making it difficult to calculate which risks to take as a journalist.</p> <p>Al Ahmad also traveled to the sites of two U.S. ground raids, including the Navy SEAL raid that made headlines days after President Donald Trump was inaugurated. One of the survivors of that raid was Sheikh Abdulillah Al Dhahab, who had not been interviewed about what happened until he spoke to Al Ahmad.</p> <p>Al Ahmad says she was drawn to this story because the Dhahab family featured so heavily in the 2017 ground raid on the village of Yakla. Some members of the family had ties to Al Qaeda, while others joined the sides fighting Al Qaeda. She spoke to FRONTLINE about how the family’s complexities reflect the complexities of Yemen, about the dangers she faced, and what she hopes viewers take away from the documentary.</p> <p><span>SAA: </span>I’ve been obsessed with the Dhahab family for a while, and I’ve been really interested in trying to find a way to tell their story. It didn’t end up in the film but <span><a href="https://carnegie-mec.org/2018/01/11/our-common-enemy-ambiguous-ties-between-al-qaeda-and-yemen-s-tribes-pub-75225">Tariq</a></span>, the head of the family, the brother of Abdulillah, was the one who declared an Islamic state in Baydah province and pledged allegiance to [Al Qaeda leader Ayman] al-Zawahiri — and one of his brothers is the one who killed him. It was such an epic family drama, on an international scale.</p> <p>I keep thinking about how to tell the complexities of Yemen… I thought this story of the family would be a really good way into this… The Yakla raid just accentuated the prominence of the story.</p> <p>It’s the most dangerous thing I’ve ever done, I think, professionally. I had to make peace with death. That’s the thing about drone strikes.</p> <p>…One of my biggest problems when I was interviewing people is that they were afraid to tell the truth. Not because they wanted to lie, but just because they didn’t know what would get them into trouble.</p> <p>Obviously, I think Yemen is an important story. Obviously, I think if you’re going to talk about people, you should go talk to them.

This is the first update.</p> <p>The Present Context:</p> <p>For more than six months the primary focus for diplomats, policy makers and analysts working on Yemen has been the now-frozen offensive on the Red Sea port city of Hodeida. </p> <p>Recent Political and Military Developments:</p> <p>The Yemeni government and the Huthis have told UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths that they do not want to hold a second round of talks, originally scheduled for the end of January, until progress had been made on the Hodeida agreement – and Griffiths agrees. Preparations for the next round are continuing, with Germany, Kuwait and Switzerland mentioned as possible locations.</p> <p>Fresh momentum cannot come soon enough. Coalition officials, particularly from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), have warned that if the parties fail to make progress soon on redeployments from Hodeida, the coalition parties and their Yemeni allies will return to hostilities. While this could be a tactical move to maintain pressure on the Huthis, it could well turn into military action if a negative momentum builds. For now, however, coalition officials remain committed to seeing the Stockholm Agreement implemented.</p> <p>Even as rival forces have traded accusations of hundreds of ceasefire breaches since the truce was announced on 18 December (read more here), developments outside of Hodeida continue to arouse concern. </p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/crisis-group-yemen-briefing-note-1">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/crisis-group-yemen-briefing-note-1</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ICG_0.pdf">https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ICG_0.pdf</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Cultural Poverty in the Kingdom of Oil: Why Saudi Arabia Wants Yemen Dead</p> <p><span>Description of Research Project</span></p> <p><span>This project focuses on a neglected aspect of the Saudi-led attack on Yemen. The dominant accounts have focused on factors related to geostrategy, political parties, historical animosities (internationally, tribally and domestically), political economy and terrorism.</span></p> <p>The task of this project is to look at the security, or the lack of it, of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in terms of cultural identity.</p> <p>Saudi society is relatively new, the current KSA formerly being the region called Hijaz which was made up of mainly nomadic Bedouin tribes and one main urban center, Mecca. Wahhabism, the official branch of Islam of the KSA is considered extremist for its belief in an unquestionable obedience to the political ruler and violent jihadism. Zaydism, the religious sect of Islam associated with the Hashemite clan (making up 20% of Yemen’s population) adheres to the notion of ijtihad "Independent reasoning." The Houthis, against whom the Saudis launched their attack on Yemen in 2015 are Hashemite; they had defeated the Saudis in the 2009 war begun by Saudi Arabia against the Houthis under virtually the same political conditions as the current war. The Houthi threat to the KSA also relates to the Houthis’ belief that the right to authority belongs only to Hashemites, which therefore gives them the right to be the sole authority culturally, socially, and politically in Yemen.</p> <p>Rich in social, cultural and material (archaeologically and architecturally) history, (and suffering from agricultural self-neglect) it stands in stark contrast to the KSA’s oil and migrant worker based society. What the former lacks in petro-dollars the latter lacks in any distinct culture. Yemen has existed in different political forms for three thousand years; the KSA is less than a hundred years old and its oil producing days are coming to a visible end. Is this why the state has pressured Saudis to plot or be creative in genealogical relation to prominent Arabian tribes? </p> <p>The project’s hypothesis is that Saudi Arabia is intimidated by Yemen the poorest country in the Arab world. This is not limited to the political and the military but extends to social, cultural and material and ancient history, and to the practice of independent thinking when it comes to interpretation of the Qura’n. Research will seek to determine the viability of this idea by looking at the self-perception of Saudis, and the perception of the KSA and Yemen by Arabs in general. Is it the case that if the KSA cannot have deep culture that Yemen should not either and thus be targets of social and cultural genocide?</p> <p><span><a href="http://laps.yorku.ca/dare/cultural-poverty-in-the-kingdom-of-oil-why-saudi-arabia-wants-yemen-dead/">http://laps.yorku.ca/dare/cultural-poverty-in-the-kingdom-of-oil-why-saudi-arabia-wants-yemen-dead/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Why Yemen matters to Saudi Arabia and the West</p> <p>Yemen is one of the most populous countries on the Arabian Peninsula. With a population that is 35 percent Shia, Saudi Arabia has also been concerned by what it sees as Iranian meddling in Yemen. Saudi Arabia has worried that the presence of Iran in Yemen could be risky for Sunni order, especially along part of its 1,800-kilometer border with Yemen.</p> <p> From the viewpoint of the Saudi authorities, such a wide border is seen as the main point of penetration for extremists and terrorists such as al-Qaeda into Saudi Arabia. You only have to look at the list of detainees at Guantanamo Bay to know that Yemen has been a fruitful recruiting ground for al-Qaeda.</p> <p>In the West's view, by controlling Yemen through the Houthis, Iran is aiming to increase its strategic and regional influence and is desirous for acceptance of its positions in Syria and Iraq, which is not desirable to the Arab-Western axis. In their view, the Houthis are the Iranian forces in Yemen, and Iran is a geopolitical threat to the axis.</p> <p>The importance of control over Yemen for Saudi Arabia and the West is obvious. Instability along Saudi’s border with Yemen seems a threat to the global political and economic order as determined by the West and the Saudis.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/432243/Why-Yemen-matters-to-Saudi-Arabia-and-the-West">https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/432243/Why-Yemen-matters-to-Saudi-Arabia-and-the-West</a></span></p> <p><span>(A K)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/undp">UN Development Programme</a></span>: Impacting safety and security in Yemen by training 25 YEMAC staff in mine action</p> <p>TTThe United Nations Development Programme began a mine action training programme for 25 staff from our national implementing partner, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (YEMAC).

However, in the past three years, there has been a great deal of discord between the two countries over the division of influence in Yemen, and the field defeats. The launch of Yemeni ballistic missiles towards the UAE and Saudi Arabia, have also brought a dispute between the two states.</p> <p>When Saudi-backed exiled President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi of Yemen, told the Saudi leadership of his desire to return to Aden, Riyadh replied that the Emirates were unable to comply with his request because it was not the right timing. Saudi Arabia strongly supports President Mansour Hadi, while the United Arab Emirates supports the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks for an independent South Yemeni state.</p> <p>Following the UAE objection, the pro-Mansour Hadi media and Yemeni Congregation for Reform (al-Islah) once again accused the Emirates of sabotaging the legal Yemeni government. Emirate media, for the first time since the meeting of Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammad bin Zayed, MbZ, with Chairman of the Islah party Mohammed al-Yadomi in December, resumed wave of attack on Yemen's al-Islah party. </p> <p>An Emirati state-run newspaper Akhbar Al Arab in a report on Tuesday accused al-Islah party of managing the black market on classified information exchange, which refers to the operation of the secret information exchange carried out with the help of the army and Ansarullah forces. </p> <p>According to Arab sources, al-Islah party has not functioned as desired by the UAE, because an important faction of the party is connected to Qatar. </p> <p>The root of the UAE and Saudi disagreements in Yemen</p> <p>Although the Emirates has participated in the Yemeni war in the form of an anti-Yemeni coalition with Saudi Arabia, the field evidence suggests that the UAE's ties to Riyadh are not very large in the Yemeni arena, and even the UAE is now reluctant to win Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia Unlike its dealings with Abu Dhabi, the pro-UAE elements have been marginalized and even fired by the Cabinet in the undercover government of Yemen.</p> <p>The discord between the two countries is enormous, but the close relationship between Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi MbZ prevented the conflict escalation. However, the differences will come to the surface in due course of time.</p> <p>The discord over the Muslim Brotherhood</p> <p>The Muslim Brotherhood and its role in southern Yemen have always been one of the major areas of conflict between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Although Riyadh has repeatedly tried to resolve this issue in a variety of ways, the UAE still considers the Muslim Brotherhood an obstacle in southern Yemen.</p> <p>The meeting between MbS and MbZ with the Muslim Brotherhood authorities in December 2017 sparked speculation of potential dispute resolution between the Yemeni Muslim Brotherhood and Abu Dhabi, though Emirati's media stance soon removed the speculation. </p> <p>Dispute over the breakup of Yemen</p> <p>The disintegration of Yemen is the second issue between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. The economic importance of southern Yemen for the UAE has led the country to pursue the division of the region, and to do so, Abu Dhabi fully supports the Southern Transitional Council headed by Aidarus al-Zoubaidi.</p> <p>In fact, in the Yemeni crisis, first and foremost, the UAE seeks to stabilize southern Yemen to keep the flow of free trade in the Strait of Bab al-Mandab and the surrounding area of Aden. Thus, Abu Dhabi will prefer the breakup of Yemen, if the STC, gets to have the upper hand – By Mohammad Ghaderi</p> <p><span><a href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/141827/Exploring-Saudi-Emiratis-disagreements-on-Yemen">https://en.mehrnews.com/news/141827/Exploring-Saudi-Emiratis-disagreements-on-Yemen</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B K P)</span></p> <p><span>Film: </span><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/CarlaOrtizOfficial/?__tn__=%2CdkC-R&amp;eid=ARCQ28VqPVZIwpVJHyc5Jt5cIiP6ppq4F5JiPEDiWCLWvu8jQ2iGEJBfwbJn3qgZft-AiNo_2Lqdv1ZG&amp;hc_ref=ARQYGxrxv6rX56ut3pCGYhz7-Ysgl9DVfHP5wUnz8fng1g4ORoLV_AHXJ8I9Ko-qGjM">Carla Ortiz</a></span><span> war live.</span></p> <p>We have few days to help <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/yemenies?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG">#Yemenies</a></span> To understand better the <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/yemeni?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG">#Yemeni</a></span> conflict &amp; what we can do about it I am <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/live?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG">#live</a></span> with <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/journalist?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG">#Journalist</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitneywebbwriter/?eid=ARBhS-bzRV7zErnyo6sVp9EXyv7NZr2WMnexrVMo2FnIdhkE6sLmaREj4VsRByUb8SPtCD0OFpGlElPR&amp;fref=tag">Whitney Webb</a></span> </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/CarlaOrtizOfficial/videos/317339882241835/">https://www.facebook.com/CarlaOrtizOfficial/videos/317339882241835/</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp3 Humanitäre Lage / Humanitarian situation</span></h2> <p><span>Siehe / Look at cp1</span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p><span>Map: </span>Yemen: Access Constraints as of 24 January 2019</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-access-constraints-24-january-2019">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-access-constraints-24-january-2019</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p>Yemen children victims of war: Report</p> <p>In March 2015, a long-running political crisis in Yemen escalated into violence. </p> <p>The conflict has had devastating consequences for children in Yemen, there are shortages of food, medicines and vital supplies. </p> <p>An estimated 85,000 children under the age of five may have died from acute malnutrition in three years of war in Yemen, a leading charity says. </p> <p>The UN warned last month that up to 14m Yemenis are on the brink of famine. </p> <p>The charity says that based on historical studies, if acute malnutrition is left untreated, around 20-30% of children will die each year. </p> <p>For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's entirely preventable," its Yemen director, Tamer Kirolos, says. </p> <p>Children who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop, their immune systems are so weak they are more prone to infections with some too frail to even cry. </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.sabanews.net/en/news524371.htm">https://www.sabanews.net/en/news524371.htm</a> </span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p>Yemen: how to help a country starving to death</p> <p>Doctors of the World brings healthcare to the most vulnerable people, including millions facing famine in Yemen.

Her father has passed away.</p> <p>In June 2018, as fighting reached Hodeidah, they were forced to flee to save their lives. They left everything behind, and escaped with Najla’s uncle’s family, fleeing 230km north east to the safety of a CARE-supported camp in the Amran region for people who have lost their homes.</p> <p>The climate is colder, and the resources are few – families rely on donations to survive. For the first few weeks, they shared a small crowded tent with her uncle’s family – eight people in total.</p> <p>Eventually they were able to find a small nearby shop that had been abandoned, and now Najla sleeps on its dirt floor with her mum and sister.</p> <p>Their lives have become extremely difficult since they fled their home, especially for the little ones.</p> <p>During the day, Najla makes the best of her situation; she loves to play with her sister, and her contagious smile helps keep her family’s spirits high. But at night is when Najla can’t cope.</p> <p>“My daughters freeze at night,” her mother said. “We are from Hodeidah – we don’t know winter, and we have never experienced such cold weather.”</p> <p>The camp that Najla’s family now depends on for supplies is home to about 1,000 displaced people from 145 families.

From January 2017 to September 2018, UNFPA reached more than 1.2 million women and adolescent girls with family planning services and nearly 550,000 people with sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and gender-based violence (GBV) services.</p> <p>Extensive partnerships and effective collaboration with the Yemeni Government, local non-profit organizations, United Nations agencies and donors have heightened the impact of UNFPA’s humanitarian response.</p> <p>Pregnant women are malnourished: Today 3.25 million women and girls of childbearing age (15 to 49 years) need support. Escalating food shortages have left an estimated 1.1 million pregnant and lactating women malnourished, and threaten the lives of 75,000 women who are likely to develop complications during childbirth, including newborns with stunted growth.</p> <p>“I had only bread and water throughout my entire pregnancy. My husband had lost his job and we could only afford very little food to feed the family,” Amana recalls. At 25, her second child was born with severe disabilities and died immediately. “Our living conditions are very difficult and it is only getting worse.”</p> <p>Supplies and services are scarce: The precarious security situation, poor road infrastructure in some areas and other travel challenges across the country mean that reproductive health personnel, supplies and services in health facilities have become much more scarce and difficult for women and girls to reach. Only one third of Yemen’s health facilities are currently functional, with many clinics shuttered because of violence, mass displacements, economic collapse, departure of health workers and lack of supplies</p> <p>“We are displaced, we are dispersed. Our situation is not normal. We are impoverished. We suffer in every way,” said Maleka Ali, who was pregnant when violence descended on her home in Taizz, Yemen. “I was frightened because of the intensity of the war and the explosions,” she told UNFPA. “We fled from Taizz, and I was so scared that I got asthma,” she said, which also put her baby at risk of health problems. Three million women and girls are at risk of gender-based violence: The number of women seeking GBV services increased by 36 per cent in 2017. Rates of child marriage (marrying under the age of 18) jumped from 52 per cent of Yemeni girls in 2016 to nearly 66 per cent in 2017.</p> <p>Objectives • Re-establish reproductive health supply chain management in Yemen to support the delivery of lifesaving supplies and services for sexual and reproductive health including safe birth, family planning and rape treatment. • Revitalize partnerships to address the needs of women and girls. • Ensure the safety and security of UNFPA staff to enable the humanitarian response to the crisis in Yemen.</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unfpa-country-experiences-yemen-when-reproductive-health-supply-chain-lifeline">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unfpa-country-experiences-yemen-when-reproductive-health-supply-chain-lifeline</a></span> and in full <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/18-291-DeliveringSuppliesCrisis-Yemen-finalweb.pdf">https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/18-291-DeliveringSuppliesCrisis-Yemen-finalweb.pdf</a></span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p>I am proud of the accomplishments of <span><a href="https://twitter.com/YemenAid_US">@YemenAid_US</a></span> in a short amount of time.

A report in the human rights office in the province stated that Saudi Arabia captured Al-Juhaida International Airport, where the Saudi forces were carrying out a series of violations, as well as turning a civilian facility (airport-port) into a military base. Arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance, Legally empowered, and physical and psychological violence are some of these violations.</p> <p>The airport is occupied by Saudi forces and they have refused to reopen it. The latest report accused the use of human and military force and intimidation, the use of individual and collective detention rooms to restrict the freedom of civilians. No detainees have been put through a fair trial or referred to a Public Prosecution. Some of the prisoners were sent to Saudi Arabia and their fate still unknown.</p> <p>The report revealed the refusal of the command of Saudi forces to allow the prosecution or any official or civil authority to enter the prison at the airport. No organization has been able to investigate the facts. The degree of violations practiced by the Saudi forces amounted to the level of crimes against humanity. The report pointed that the office does not have any integrated legal monitoring data because of the lack of access to the detainee, noting that the preliminary information indicates that some military arrest of citizens in private rooms for between 1 and 10 days, and taken to an unknown destination (forced concealment).</p> <p>The report revealed that the Saudi forces, with the complicity of the so-called legitimacy, the establishment of several military barracks near the homes and areas of citizens and their places of work and source of livelihood, which led to the evacuation of the inhabitants of these sites.</p> <p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=5018&amp;cat_id=1">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=5018&amp;cat_id=1</a></span></p> <p><span>(A T)</span></p> <p>Hadi government-aligned forces began a campaign against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (<span>AQAP</span>) in western <span>Taiz governorate</span>, southern Yemen on January 21.
