The strike took place in the morning hours at approximately 8:25 AM GMT+3 and hit a crowded marketplace.</p> <p>Imagery of a guidance fin displayed by media outlets and Human Rights Watch point to a GBU-12 Paveway II as the munition used in the strike and images published by the Saudi-led coalition show the apparent targeting of the bus and its aftermath on the day of the strike.</p> <p>The strike killed and wounded several children who were traveling on the bus for a field trip as well as a number of children nearby in the marketplace.</p> <p><strong>WHERE?</strong></p> <p>Houthi forces, the Saudi-led coalition, independent non-governmental organizations, and open source evidence all concur that the incident took place in Dahyan, Yemen, on the north side of the N1 road which runs through the town, in the approximate vicinity of 17.064206° 43.601578°.</p> <p>Overhead drone footage of the scene of the incident published by the Houthi-aligned Al Masirah news channel on August 10, 2018 shows a damaged building.</p> <p>The August 12, 2018 video published by Al Masirah appears to be the most useful footage available for locating the scene of the incident because the fresh wounds on children scene bleeding and uncoagulated blood in front of bus wreckage and uncleared human remains suggests the footage was taken relatively close to the time of the incident, when there would be fewer opportunities to disturb the scene. </p> <p>At 3:14 in the video, the camera person stands amidst the wreckage. At 3:19, the camera records the street while standing next to the bus wreckage.</p> <p>The footage at 3:19 shows three areas of reference: a sign with red Arabic script on one side of an intersection (purple rectangle), a white awning across the street from the sign at the intersection (yellow rectangle, and an apparent crater in the ground in front of the bus wreckage (red rectangle). The sign, the white awning, and the crater are also apparent in those positions when viewed from across the street, as the overhead footage from August 10, 2018 Al Masirah video illustrated.</p> <p><strong>WHEN?</strong></p> <p>Witness accounts, third party investigations, and statements by both the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi movement concur that the incident took place on August 9, 2018. Security camera footage, witness accounts, third party investigations, open source analysis all point to a conclusion that the strike took place in the morning at around tk</p> <p>Photos and statements posted Twitter bracket the upper limit of when a strike could have taken place to somewhere around 9 AM. </p> <p>On August 9, 2018, Twitter accounts affiliated with news outlets and the Houthi movement began to tweet news of a strike in Dahyan around 9:30 AM.</p> <p><strong>WHAT DAMAGE WAS DONE?</strong></p> <p><strong>TO WHO?</strong></p> <p>The incident primarily damaged a bus used to transport school children. The bus was parked in a market area of Dahyan and destroyed the front area of an apparent market stall, and killed a number of individuals present in the market at the time.</p> <p>Independent investigations, Houthi media outlets, and witness statements all concur that the explosion in the Dahyan market struck a bus used to transport children traveling on a field trip.</p> <p>Independent investigations</p> <p>A report on the Dahyan incident, prepared by the Houthi Ministry of Human Rights and provided to the UN Panel of Experts on Yemen, contained an itinerary for the bus trip, which allegedly began in Dahyan, included a stop at a Houthi cemetery in Ja’milah, further northwest up the the N1 road from Dahyan, and a return southeast along the N1 with the intended ultimate destination of Saada. The report provided to the UN Panel of Experts states that the bus stopped in Dahyan at approximately 9:00 AM GMT+3 for the children to buy water and food when the strike later took place. </p> <p>Human Rights Watch spoke to children who said they were on the bus and affirmed that they were ”part of a summer program, which began in June, to study at the Grand Mosque from 7:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. daily, except Thursdays and Fridays.”</p> <p>Houthi media outlets</p> <p>A documentary on the incident produced by the Houthi-aligned Al Masirah network featured the claim of Ali Hassan, an alleged witness that the children on the bus were on a “summer trip and between spiritual sport in which they performed their last prayer.” </p> <p>Houthi-aligned Al Masirah TV published footage purportedly recorded by one of the children on the bus showing a number of children playing inside the vehicle and in a Houthi martyrs cemetery shortly before the strike.</p> <p>Witness statements</p> <p>Children </p> <p>Dead children and children with fresh wounds and uncoagulated blood are visible throughout the August 12, 2019 minute Al Masirah video recorded at the scene of the incident. </p> <p>The presence of so many dead and injured children at the scene of the incident is consistent with accounts provided by Houthi forces as well as independent investigators. </p> <p>The Houthi Ministry of Education published a list on August 18, 2018 with what it claimed were the names of 38 people killed in the strike and 55 wounded, four of whom were allegedly adult teachers and 34 of whom were children. </p> <p>In addition to children attending the school trip, witness statements given to Human Rights Watch indicate that people in the area at the time of the incident may have also been killed by the explosion.</p> <p><strong>TO WHAT?</strong></p> <p>The area affected by the Dahyan incident was a crowded market as documented by witnesses, satellite imagery, open source imagery, and imagery from the Saudi-led coalition.</p> <p><em>Witnesses</em></p> <p>Satellite imagery<br /><br /> Historical satellite imagery from the scene of the incident shows densely parked vehicles consistent with market activity. </p> <p>Open source imagery</p> <p>The CCTV footage of the strike shows the area around the incident was relatively crowded with vehicles both before and after the incident.</p> <p>Saudi-led coalition imagery</p> <p><strong>WHAT DO PARTIES TO CONFLICT SAY AND DOES IT STAND UP?</strong></p> <p><em>THE SLC</em></p> <p>Open source evidence cannot verify the claim that Houthi leaders responsible for drone strikes were in the vicinity of the Dahyan strike on August 9, 2018. </p> <p>No other small arms are visible within the vicinity of the bus wreckage or surroundings. There are no apparent witnesses who reported seeing large numbers of armed men or Houthi military activity on that day.</p> <p><em>THE HOUTHIS</em></p> <p>The Houhi movement and its media outlets stated that the incident was an airstrike on a group of children who had been visiting religious locations on the day, </p> <p><strong>WHAT BOMB WAS USED?</strong></p> <p>Witness accounts and imagery of a guidance fin allegedly found at the scene suggest that a GBU-12 Paveway II laser guided bomb caused the explosion.</p> <p><strong>CRATER</strong></p> <p>An impact crater is apparent in multiple sources of imagery of the scene of the incident. The crater sits approximately a meter or two off of the curb in the northern side of the N1 road in Dahyan and slightly to the southeast of the stalls where the bus wreckage sat in footage recorded and published shortly after the attack depicted. The crater is not visible in Google Earth satellite imagery.</p> <p><strong>REMNANTS</strong></p> <p>Houthi and local sources presented reporters and Human Rights Watch with an apparent guidance fin for a GBU-12 Paveway II munition (with plenty of footage)</p> <p><span><a href="https://yemen.bellingcat.com/investigations/saa10009-dahyan-bus-bombing">https://yemen.bellingcat.com/investigations/saa10009-dahyan-bus-bombing</a></span></p> <p>and all Bellincat Yemen investigations here: <span><a href="https://yemen.bellingcat.com/investigations">https://yemen.bellingcat.com/investigations</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p> <p><strong>Education in Yemen is the strangest in the world. War destroys 2,600 schools</strong></p> <p>A small unfinished house in the north of Sanaa International Airport at the area of ​​Beit Al-Halley and with some personal efforts, the abandoned house was transferred to “Bir al-Ghusain” school, where 320 students study.</p> <p>Children in the elementary school are studying in a very difficult circumstances and their suffering exceed expectations. A large number of students are studying in a house with only the outer structure, in a deserted house where there are no windows, no doors and no toilets!</p> <p>Stories of those students are beyond heartbreaking. For example, a little girl after finishing with the classroom, she go to search in the trash to find something to eat, she keeps studying when she is starving, another child wears his shoes in the morning until he finishes then he finds his brother in the way back and give him his shoes so that he could go to school another girl who studies in the morning, exchange her bag in the way back with her sister who study in the afternoon of the day!</p> <p>I also saw children without shoes and school uniforms. I saw hunger and misery in the eyes of those children. I saw the classrooms crowded with students sitting on the ground. I saw great teachers teaching children without salaries.</p> <p>“Daily Worker” interviewed the supervisor of this house and asked him why they teach the children in this house, that looks like the abandoned house, he replied that the general school is very far from where they live, they can’t afford going so far.</p> <p>Because of the sewage that fills many of the holes at this area, parents were afraid that their children would drown and die, so they prevent them from going to school and as a result they were deprived of education, so my wife and I decided to rent this house and turned it into a school, principle of school said. “We hope that we get support in order to prepare for them an equipped and valid school for study, but recently we hope that the students get breakfast meal because they really can’t afford buying breakfast also the girl we saw eating from the garbage touched our hearts.</p> <p>The school lacks the simplest requirements for education.</p> <p>In the education sector, the current war has left an educational crisis, the worst in the history of contemporary Yemen and one of the largest educational crises in the Middle East after Syria. The number of underprivileged pupils reached 3.5 million compared with 1.7 million before the war. One-third of the educational schools suffered various damages as a result of their direct shelling or use as for military actions.</p> <p>More than 2,600 schools were partially or totally destroyed – By <span>Redhwan Alsharif (photos)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://dailyworker.it/education-in-yemen/">https://dailyworker.it/education-in-yemen/</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p> <p><strong>Child Marriage in Yemen Seen As a Means of Survival</strong></p> <p>According to an Oxfam <span><a href="https://www.oxfam.ca/news/yemeni-crisis-forces-parents-to-marry-off-three-year-old-child-in-desperate-attempt-to-keep-family-alive/">report</a></span>, child marriage – already long a problem in war-torn Yemen – has increased as the devastation of the war there worsens and an estimated <span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/14-million-people-yemen-face-imminent-great-big-famine-n923756">14 million</a></span> face famine. In a published statement, Oxfam's Yemen Country Director Muhsin Siddiquey <span><a href="https://www.oxfam.ca/news/yemeni-crisis-forces-parents-to-marry-off-three-year-old-child-in-desperate-attempt-to-keep-family-alive/">remarked</a></span>, "As this war has gone on, people's means of coping with devastating levels of hunger have become more and more desperate. They're being forced to take steps that blight their children's lives now and for decades to come."</p> <p>Parents in Yemen now frequently forego meals so their children can eat, but even those meals – usually bread and tea or mashed tomato pulp – are spare and few. Some families <span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-civil-war-latest-starving-famine-mothers-hungry-children-saudi-arabia-iran-proxy-wars-middle-a8333921.html">eat just</a></span> one meal a day. The images of starving and dying children have spread through social media, but no solution has been forthcoming as the conflict continues. For many parents, marrying off daughters in exchange for dowry has become a question of survival.</p> <p>Yemen has no minimum age for marriage, <span><a href="https://www.unfpa.org/news/families-increasingly-resort-child-marriage-yemen's-conflict-grinds">reports</a></span> the United Nations Family Population Agency (UNFPA), with almost one third of women surveyed in 2013 having wed before the age of 18. According to the Denver Post , laws setting a marriage age at 15 were <span><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2017/05/27/child-marriage-yemen/">repealed in the 1990s</a></span> "under pressure from Muslim conservatives who argue that Islamic Sharia law does not prohibit child marriage and that attempts to curb the practice are a Western plot."</p> <p>Hence even before the conflict, Yemeni fathers often forced their daughters into marriage as an alleged means of "protection," saving their honor in the face of the possibility of rape – a fate that could cause shame to the entire family.</p> <p>With the war, which began with an attack by Houti rebels in 2014, that percentage has increased, though actual figures are unavailable given the current circumstances there. One 2016 UNFPA survey, however, noted that "of the child marriage survivors in the North, 72 percent were married between the ages 13 and 15. Of those in the South, 62 were married before age 16."</p> <p>Even girls as young as 10 might be married off, sometimes to men decades older; Since husbands are legally <span><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2017/05/27/child-marriage-yemen/">forbidden to</a></span> consummate the marriage before the child reaches puberty, younger girls become servants for their husbands, and occasionally their husbands' parents.</p> <p>Horrific as these stories are, the parents are not entirely to blame. It is the culture they have always lived in, one that has indoctrinated them with the idea of women as nothing more than property, dehumanized objects to be bought and sold and used. In this context, the decision to sell a daughter into marriage may come as a desperate act to save the lives of other sons and daughters. But the fact that the option exists at all is a cultural depravity, not just their own – by Abigail R. Esman</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.investigativeproject.org/7900/child-marriage-in-yemen-seen-as-a-means">https://www.investigativeproject.org/7900/child-marriage-in-yemen-seen-as-a-means</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>The Social Justice Blind Spots in the New Arab Constitutions</strong></p> <p>The Arab uprisings that began at the end of 2010 were motivated by a number of concerns, not least of which were unacceptably low standards of living and growing inequality in much of the region. The millions of people who participated in the uprisings were acutely aware of their situation, and articulated their demands in a number of slogans that included specific references to concepts such as “social justice.” In response to these demands, ten different countries (close to half of the region) engaged in what was supposed to be wholesale or partial reform.</p> <p>A comparison of other countries from outside the region, including those that have grappled with similar issues to those that exist in the Middle East, shows that better constitution drafting was in reach—or should have been.</p> <p>Yemen</p> <p>In January 2011, Yemen was teetering on the border of collapse. The state had completely violated its social compact with the people: socioeconomic conditions were appalling (particularly for women) and security was highly precarious.<span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/social-justice-blind-spots-new-arab-constitutions/?agreed=1&amp;fbclid=IwAR2ES-AfPVuwsExe6Gl8mR8UxGptvfr-eNFtmsMlQbjsC2t3RUYdrVBYusQ&amp;agreed=1#easy-footnote-bottom-81"><sup>81</sup></a></span> Earlier constitutional provisions promising generous socioeconomic rights had little to no impact for the general population. The initial stages of the 2011 uprising almost led to a civil war, and <span><a href="https://www.idea.int/publications/catalogue/yemens-peaceful-transition-autocracy-could-it-have-succeeded">required</a></span> significant on-the-ground intervention by senior UN officials and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to avoid a full-blown conflict.<span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/social-justice-blind-spots-new-arab-constitutions/?agreed=1&amp;fbclid=IwAR2ES-AfPVuwsExe6Gl8mR8UxGptvfr-eNFtmsMlQbjsC2t3RUYdrVBYusQ&amp;agreed=1#easy-footnote-bottom-82"><sup>82</sup></a></span> State institutions, the country’s main political forces, and the people were faced with a choice: they could either launch a real reform effort that would introduce the type of radical change that the situation and the people were demanding, or they could satisfy themselves with tinkering with the state’s institutional structure and with introducing superficial changes to the wording of specific provisions. Following Ali Abdullah Saleh’s resignation from the presidency, a National Dialogue Conference (NDC) convened (from March 2013 to January 2014), which led in turn to the formation of a constitutional drafting commission (CDC). The transitional agreement that helped avert a full-blown conflict was referred to as the “GCC Initiative” and its “Implementation Mechanism.”</p> <p>The conference opened in March 2013 and closed in January 2014, after its original deadline of September 2013. The NDC was tasked with addressing a large number of issues, including redesigning the state’s institutional structure as well as national and local reconciliation. It was intended to include a broad range of political forces, actors, and representatives. The Implementation Mechanism also set out a list of all the issues that should be discussed by the NDC, including the process through which the constitution should be drafted, the state’s structure, the political system, and human rights.<span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/social-justice-blind-spots-new-arab-constitutions/?agreed=1&amp;fbclid=IwAR2ES-AfPVuwsExe6Gl8mR8UxGptvfr-eNFtmsMlQbjsC2t3RUYdrVBYusQ&amp;agreed=1#easy-footnote-bottom-83"><sup>83</sup></a></span></p> <p>The way in which the entire transition was structured shows that the state had little intention to engage in any serious reform. The most pressing question, and the one most likely to lead to conflict, was whether Yemen should reformulate itself as a federation and how that should be achieved. The issue was decided only in very broad terms by one of the NDC’s working groups, and eventually left most of the essential design features to the CDC (an unrepresentative group of individuals of whom only a third had any real capacity to deal with the federal question). The debate that took place is captured in the outcomes, which show that the working group members engaged in superficial changes—tinkering without any regard for whether or not any of their provisions would ever be implemented in practice.<span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/social-justice-blind-spots-new-arab-constitutions/?agreed=1&amp;fbclid=IwAR2ES-AfPVuwsExe6Gl8mR8UxGptvfr-eNFtmsMlQbjsC2t3RUYdrVBYusQ&amp;agreed=1#easy-footnote-bottom-85"><sup>85</sup></a></span></p> <p>In subsequent years, the crisis in Yemen worsened, ultimately descending into war. The conflict has a number of causes, including the constitutional negotiation process.

During the Cold War, the United States had strong interests in ensuring the Middle East was not dominated by the Soviet Union—we couldn’t risk a major disruption to the global oil market, which was once dominated by the Persian Gulf. But today, there is no threat to the region from any hegemon. Not only that, but also the world energy balance of power has shifted dramatically. With a vastly different geopolitical reality, U.S. foreign policy should modernize and recalibrate, starting in the Middle East.</p> <p>Meanwhile, America’s Permian shale oil reservoir has officially become the world’s biggest, producing more than four million barrels per day. </p> <p>This <span><a href="https://www.realclearenergy.org/video/2017/04/26/three_energy_revolutions_hidden_in_plain_sight.html">U.S. energy revolution</a></span> should profoundly impact our foreign policy, but because of intransigence and groupthink in Washington, it hasn’t—yet.</p> <p>Today, because policymakers overvalue the strategic importance of the Middle East, there is an irrational fixation on Iran.

The status quo leaves us with less leverage over either side and has consistently placed us in morally dubious situations that run counter to short and long-term American interests.

This includes those who might die “from hunger, disease and the lack of health clinics and other infrastructure than from fighting.”</p> <p>According to the UN’s latest report called Assessing the Impact of War on Development in Yemen, many people will have died from the side effects of the conflict and not the actual fighting, with the combined death toll - from fighting and disease – at “233,000, or 0.8 percent of Yemen's 30 million-strong population.”</p> <p>This is not to mention the costs of those five years of conflict that has already cost Yemen’s economy $89 billion and counting. It’s all the reason why the war-torn country, the poorest nation in the Arab world, needs a temporary cessation of hostilities now. There is no need for the failed war to drag on until 2030 or further – an unnecessary war that the UN says could set back the country by 26 years.</p> <p>All this, of course, depends on the United States.</p> <p><span><a href="http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980208001119">http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980208001119</a></span></p> <p>My remark: This is from Iran.</p> <p>(* B H K)</p> <p>Death and Shame in Yemen: Saudi Coalition Airstrikes Kill as Mercenaries Rape</p> <p>On Sunday, a Sudanese mercenary fighter stabbed and raped a 50-year-old woman named Saada Omar Ahmad Akish, a mother in an impoverished family from the Al-Hima area, al-Tahita Directorate in Hodeida.</p> <p>News of the incident soon spread and has become an issue for local residents.

Quite apart from the continuing catastrophic conflict, the massive overdraw of existing groundwater due to unregulated drilling of tube wells since the 1970s has created a major water crisis that affects the future of the county’s estimated 28 million people. While once known for its rich traditions of agriculture due to its extensive highland terrace systems, spate flow and runoff water harvesting, Yemen is now food insecure, relying almost entirely on food imports.</p> <p>This article surveys the range of water resources in Yemen and their sustainability in light of climate change predictions. I examined government and development aid reports to highlight the causes of the water crisis and the failure of previous governments to resolve it. The situation is even more critical today, given the ongoing war between a Saudi-led coalition and a Huthi alliance that has created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. I conclude with priorities for mitigating the water crisis and promoting sustainable agriculture for Yemen’s post-conflict future – by <span>Daniel Varisco (sunscribers only)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10745-019-0070-y">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10745-019-0070-y</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span>Film by UNFPA: </span>Challenging the odds amid conflict in Yemen</p> <p>Meet the woman who launched Yemen's first women-run security business thanks to a grant and training provided by the UNFPA-supported Springboard programme.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lqFLjlbZUs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lqFLjlbZUs</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/unicef">UN Children's Fund</a></span>: Humanitarian Action for Children 2019 - Yemen (Revised April 2019)</p> <p>The conflict-driven humanitarian crisis in Yemen is the largest emergency globally, with more than 24.1 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. Conflict has led to internal displacement of 3.6 million people, including 2 million children, left millions of public sector workers without salaries for years and undermined humanitarian access to many vulnerable populations. An estimated 12 million Yemenis, including 7 million children, will depend on food assistance in 2019. The economic deterioration continues, with the rial losing nearly 50 per cent of its value since September 2018, and affected families struggling to purchase food.</p> <p>Children are the primary victims of the crisis. According to the Country Task Force on Monitoring and Reporting on grave child rights violations, more than 6,700 children have been verified as killed or maimed since the start of the conflict and more than 2,700 boys have been recruited into armed forces and groups ; however, the actual figures are likely to be higher. Children remain under extreme risk of death or injury from unexploded ordinances, landmines and explosive remnants of war. The damage and closure of schools and hospitals are threatening children's access to education and health services, rendering them vulnerable to serious protection concerns. At least 2 million children in Yemen are out of school.</p> <p>Humanitarian strategy</p> <p>Results from 2019</p> <p>As of 28 February 2019, UNICEF had US$149.2 million available against the revised appeal of US$536 million. This ensures access to primary healthcare services to children and women, including the provision of common childhood illnesses, antenatal care, delivery and UNICEF’s response to the AWD/suspected cholera outbreak through an integrated health, nutrition, WASH and communication for development plan. Over 3.3 million people accessed safe drinking water and over 1 million people were engaged in awareness and behaviour change activities.<br /> Health facilities received supplies and operational support. </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/appeals/files/2019-HAC-Yemen-revised-April-12.pdf">https://www.unicef.org/appeals/files/2019-HAC-Yemen-revised-April-12.pdf</a></span> = <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/humanitarian-action-children-2019-yemen-revised-april-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/humanitarian-action-children-2019-yemen-revised-april-2019</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H P)</span></p> <p><span>Flm by Aljazeera: </span>Yemen: UN urges donors to convert pledges into cash</p> <p>Only a small proportion of funds promised by top donors Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has been received.</p> <p>The UN has asked that $4bn pledged for emergency humanitarian aid be paid but only a small portion of it has been received.</p> <p>The two countries fighting in Yemen's civil war alongside the government have pledged $1.5bn between them but <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Saudi Arabia</a></span> and the <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-arab-emirates.html">UAE</a></span> have decided to pay in instalments, drip-feeding their funds.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/yemen-urges-donors-convert-pledges-cash-190430093255667.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/yemen-urges-donors-convert-pledges-cash-190430093255667.html</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzmQEApMUZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzmQEApMUZw</a></span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/unfpa">United Nations Population Fund</a></span>: UNFPA Response in Yemen: Monthly Situation Report #03 March 2019</p> <p>FAST FACTS</p> <p>24.1M In need of some form of assistance; 14.3M In acute need; 19.7M Lack access to basic health services; 14.4M In need of protection; 3.3M Internally displaced; 6.0M Women of reproductive age (15-49 yrs); 1.0M Pregnant women malnourished; 120,000 Women and girls at risk of violence</p> <p>Nearly four years of conflict has disintegrated the economic and social fabric.

Saudi Arabia’s military spending, though it decreased by 6.5 percent, stood at an estimated $67.6 billion placing it third in the world. The United States with a spend of $649 billion far outranked second place China at an estimated $250 billion.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, however, continues to be the world’s <span><a href="https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2019/global-arms-trade-usa-increases-dominance-arms-flows-middle-east-surge-says-sipri">largest importer</a></span> of military arms. That fact helps to explain how in 2018 SIPRI estimates the kingdom devoted 8.8 percent of GDP to military expenditure. The average spend for the top 40 countries is 2.1 percent of GDP with most spending below three percent. Iran, Saudi Arabia’s regional rival, spent 2.7 percent while Israel’s stood at 4.3 percent. </p> <p>In a comparable study published by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) the GDP figures for previous years were even higher. The IISS estimates that Saudi Arabia spent 12.51 percent of its GDP in 2015, 12.61 percent in 2016, and 11.30 percent in 2017. Those figures include security costs. </p> <p>Cordesman raises an interesting point.

Whatever assistance Iran has provided, they don’t tell the Houthis what to do and the Houthis don’t necessarily listen to them when they offer advice. Iran isn’t responsible for starting the conflict in Yemen, nor is it responsible for escalating it. The administration’s monomaniacal need to pin everything in the region on Iran is discrediting and shows how warped their view of Yemen’s conflict is by Saudi propaganda. The Saudis and Emiratis bear substantial responsibility for escalating and prolonging the war, and the U.S. shares in that responsibility because our government has been aiding them every step of the way.

Abd Al-Qadir al-Jaziri wrote an early account about the history of coffee and explained that Sufi monks would use the drink as a stimulant, to help them stay awake during their meditation and prayers.</p> <p>“They drank it every Monday and Friday eve, putting it in a large vessel made of red clay,” Jaziri writes of the Sufi, as recounted in <span><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=AGaTAgAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">The World of Caffeine</a></span>. “Their leader ladled it out with a small dipper and gave it to them to drink, passing it to the right, while they recited one of their usual formulas, ‘There is no God, but God, the Master, the Clear Reality.’”</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.ozy.com/flashback/the-islamic-roots-of-coffee/32702">https://www.ozy.com/flashback/the-islamic-roots-of-coffee/32702</a></span></p> <p>(C)</p> <p>Photo of Jews leaving Yemen for Israel as part of the Operation Magic Carpet in which 49,000 Yemeni Jews left to Israel between 1948 and 1950.</p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/Ndawsari/status/1122794040825716736">https://twitter.com/Ndawsari/status/1122794040825716736</a></span></p> <p>(* A )</p> <p>Film: Invasion of locusts in Yemen</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.meteoweb.eu/video-gallery/invasione-di-cavallette-in-yemen/id/333069025/">http://www.meteoweb.eu/video-gallery/invasione-di-cavallette-in-yemen/id/333069025/</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vorige / Previous</span></h2> <p><span><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-532-yemen-war-mosaic-532">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-532-yemen-war-mosaic-532</a> </span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 1-532/ Yemen War Mosaic 1-532:</span></h2> <p><span><a href="/autoren/dklose">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose</a></span> oder / or <span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Der saudische Luftkrieg im Bild / Saudi aerial war images:</span></h2> <p>(18 +, Nichts für Sensible!) / (18 +; Graphic!)</p> <p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/">http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="http://www.yemenwar.info/">http://www.yemenwar.info/</a></span></p> <p>und alle Liste aller Luftangriffe / and list of all air raids:</p> <p><span><a href="http://yemendataproject.org/data/">http://yemendataproject.org/data/</a></span></p></div>
