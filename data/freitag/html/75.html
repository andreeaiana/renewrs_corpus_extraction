The country, by many accounts the poorest in the Arab world, attracts little attention next to struggles in Syria, Iraq, Libya and beyond. These other conflicts provide more compelling pictures and more gripping stories, and Yemen appears to many to be dusty and remote. </p> <p>Yemen’s problems cannot be ignored, though, for at least two reasons. First, Yemen’s problems seem unlikely to stay in Yemen. With immediate proximity to Saudi Arabia, the Bab al-Mandab Strait, and the Horn of Africa, a collapse in Yemen will have a profound effect on its neighbors. </p> <p>These numbers can rarely affect how things are on the ground, because simply we do not feel numbers, we do not see in them the people who were counted, we do not get what it means to be hungry for days, and scared for your life all the time. We only know that these are big numbers, and we also know that something should be done. Because if we only act on the things that we can touch or feel, then no one will be there to help when we need it most. </p> <p>Yemen has been a country consumed by poverty and lack of resources, its strategic location acted as a curse more than a blessing – by Mona Zaid</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news537223.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news537223.htm</a> = <a href="https://www.yemenextra.net/2019/05/25/happy-yemen-is-not-happy/">https://www.yemenextra.net/2019/05/25/happy-yemen-is-not-happy/</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1 Am wichtigsten / Most important</span></h2> <p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Film: Dr. Daniele Ganser: Der illegale Krieg von Saudi-Arabien gegen Jemen 2015 (Offenbach 2.4.2019)</strong></p> <p>Der Schweizer Historiker und Friedensforscher Dr. Daniele Ganser sprach am 2.

Every single household in Yemen is bearing the repercussions of this interruption.</p> <p>Starvation Is a Weapon of War</p> <p>Many employees left their government jobs and switched to the private sector in order to make a living. However, teachers and employees in the education sector were forced to continue working due to the threat of dismissal and replacement. They were hit the hardest by the suspension of salaries, since this sector is not considered as a profit-generating sector that can provide employees with small sums of money every once in a while, like in other sectors.</p> <p>The central bank was moved from Sana’a to Aden, and the fates of thousands of employees in the public sector were thrust into the unknown, particularly for those living in areas under the control of Ansar Allah armed group (Houthis). The government did not treat them as citizens and did not pay them their salaries, nor did the Houthis consider themselves responsible for paying their salaries.</p> <p>Ahmed says: “We continue working in order to keep our job and undertake our obligations. We prepare because it’s not a full-time lecturing job. Hence, we can do our jobs and at the same time work elsewhere to cover our own expenses.” <strong>Pride and Humanitarian Assistance</strong></p> <p>Prior to the war, Ahmed considered it shameful for university professors to receive aid, which was distributed as humanitarian aid to the needy and poor during the holy month of Ramadan and religious events. Now, he is standing in line, waiting for his turn to get his share. He says: “Your respect for yourself declines in the face of your poor ability to cover your needs. All you think about is meeting and covering your needs and not saving your image. You give up appearances, status and prestige in return for providing the basics of living.”</p> <p>This barrier began to disappear over time, and he started demanding the right to receive these food baskets provided by international organizations as assistance to those affected by the conflict. Receiving assistance is not humiliating or shameful but rather it’s an attempt to remedy an emergency humanitarian situation.</p> <p>Travelling in order to Receive a Salary</p> <p>The Hadi authority has adopted a particular procedure to pay the salaries of employees in the areas under the control of the Houthi group, which stipulates the necessity of traveling to Aden governorate with the status of “displaced person” in order to receive their salaries. This requires great efforts and is dangerous, especially with the presence of security points and the security belt that prevents citizens from the northern areas from entering Aden.</p> <p>Houses that Are Falling Apart</p> <p>Employees are left with two empty pockets in front of their children, unable to provide basic meals or to provide the value of medical service, in case of an illness. They also face the threat of losing their places of residence and families after being unable to pay the rent.</p> <p>Many families could not bear the consequences of the salary cuts. Many households did not survive this stormy tide of need, destitution and disability. The economic conditions quickly forced numerous families to disintegrate and break up. People spend dozens of years trying to build their families, but in light of such a crisis, they are unable to protect or maintain them and can’t meet their requirements and their responsibilities.</p> <p>Ahmed lost his wife because of his deteriorating financial state. His heart aches when he remembers her and he says: “I lost my wife because of our financial situation. We were separated as a result of these circumstances and I was unable to provide the requirements and undertake my obligations. She didn’t ask for much but I couldn’t even provide that. Family visits also became very limited due to salary interruptions and the sharp increase in transportation costs.”</p> <p>The lives of many employees have been destroyed, and it is impossible for them to return to their old lives even if they are paid. Those families that have been broken up and disbanded will not be healed or reunified by disbursed salaries, but we really hope to protect the rest of the families that countless of people worked hard to build and preserve.</p> <p><span><a href="http://mwatana.org/en/interruption-of-salaries/">http://mwatana.org/en/interruption-of-salaries/</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B E P)</strong></p> <p><strong>An Unending Fast: What the Failure of the Amman Meetings Means for Yemen</strong></p> <p>After three days of United Nations-mediated meetings in Amman with representatives from Yemen’s <span><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/55">divided central bank</a></span>, the delegations from Sana’a and Aden arrived at no agreement aside from a commitment to meet again.</p> <p>Both before and during the talks, which began on May 14, the Sana’a Center met regularly with both delegations, as well as other Yemeni and international stakeholders. The indication from these discussions is that the meetings were another opportunity missed. A best-case scenario emerging from the talks would have been that hundreds of thousands of civil servants would receive regular salaries for the first time in three years, helping to bring an income to millions of their family members in the midst of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Meaningful progress in Amman would also have helped kickstart the <span><a href="https://osesgy.unmissions.org/full-text-stockholm-agreement">Stockholm Agreement</a></span>; instead, the lack of progress may now paralyze UN-mediated peace efforts.</p> <p>Despite the stakes, the two delegations never met face-to-face during the talks – though they smoked shisha together one evening. UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths never showed up. Indeed, Griffiths had initially scheduled just one day for the talks, which were extended to three days only after requests for the extension from both delegations.</p> <p>The primary issue dividing the parties was what to do with revenues from the three ports around Hudaydah City – Ras Issa, Saleef, and Hudaydah, the busiest ports in Yemen and the primary entry points for the country’s commercial and humanitarian shipments. </p> <p>The Stockholm Agreement stipulated that revenues from the ports should be deposited in the Central Bank of Yemen’s (CBY) Hudaydah branch, and used to contribute to the payment of civil servant salaries in Hudaydah and “<span><a href="https://osesgy.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/hodeidah_agreement_0.pdf">throughout Yemen</a></span>.” Going into the talks in Amman, the government position was that the CBY in Hudaydah should be completely under the authority of the CBY in Aden. This entailed rescinding all Houthi appointments since 2014, and moving forward, the Hudaydah branch would have to follow all directives from, and report all activities to, the Aden CBY. The Yemeni government also wanted all state revenues from Hudaydah governorate – not just from the ports – submitted to the Hudaydah CBY. These would be used to pay the salaries of all public sector workers in Hudaydah, based on the 2014 payroll – meaning the removal of any Houthi-appointed personnel. Any remaining revenues were to be allocated to pay salaries of health and education staff elsewhere in Yemen that are not currently being paid. As a starting point the Houthi delegation wanted to discuss all state revenues in Yemen, with the submission of revenues from Hudaydah port to the authority of the Aden CBY being contingent on all civil servant salaries in the country being paid.</p> <p>The revenues from Hudaydah’s ports were a central motivator for the Saudi-led military coalition – which backs the internationally recognized Yemeni government – launching its campaign to take the city last year, regardless of its claims of weapons smuggling through the ports. While the Stockholm Agreement would mean the Houthis giving up the ports, there were several counterbalancing factors from their perspective: full civil servant salary payments would allow them to gain revenue through taxes and increased economic activity in their areas, especially considering that most civil servants live in Houthi-controlled territory. Houthi forces also avoided a battle for Hudaydah, which would have been costly in manpower and money.</p> <p>Signing a deal on Hudaydah revenues without an agreement to pay civil servant salaries country-wide would have meant only revenue losses for the Houthis, and thus was something they weren’t willing to do. For exactly that reason, the government of Yemen wanted the ports’ revenues to be used to pay civil servant salaries in Hudaydah only, rather than the whole of Yemen – as this would deprive the Houthis of an avenue to recover lost revenues. Rather, the Yemeni government delegation advocated a gradual approach of paying the salaries in Hudaydah first and then financing Hudaydah public services, with the disbursement of any remaining revenue to be agreed on at a later stage.</p> <p>So after three days of UN staff running back and forth between the delegations, there were no concessions – By Spencer Osberg and Hannah Patchett</p> <p><span><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/7433">http://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/7433</a></span></p> <p>Remark by Judith Brown: The crisis in Yemen is essentially an economic one - the country's economy ceased to function four years ago and salaries of civil servants have not been paid for three years, since Hadi moved the Central Bank. Yet Martin Griffiths just didn't turn up to a crucial meeting in Amman on the payment of salaries. The article also states that the Houthis handed over support of the port of Hodeida to Houthi supporters. I don't know why anyone thinks this is strange. They were hardly likely to hand over the port to someone who supported Hadi and his government - that would have been akin to surrender. And so, after the three day meeting I can report that nothing whatsoever has changed.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157608800823641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157608800823641</a></span></p> <p>My comment: This article shows how the Hadi government tried to eat the cake alone: They wanted to get 100 % control by negotiations. Their main tool is claiming they alone possess „legitimacy“ and therefore there cannot be any sharing ot anything. This well fits to the scheme of their smear campaign against UN envoy Griffiths, who tried to stay as neutral as possible and to comply to both sides. This simply is impossible with one side claiming 100 %.</p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>Film: Der Kampf gegen Cholera im Jemen</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/090325-000-A/der-kampf-gegen-cholera-im-jemen/">https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/090325-000-A/der-kampf-gegen-cholera-im-jemen/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/who">World Health Organization</a></span>: WHO EMRO Weekly Epidemiological Monitor: Volume 12, Issue 21 (26 April 2019)</p> <p>Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign in Yemen</p> <p>As the scale up of response to the ongoing cholera outbreak in Yemen continues, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPHP) and partners with the support of WHO and other partners conducted the first round of cholera vaccination campaigns in seven districts between February and April 2019.<br /> A total of 1,721,291 people were targeted by the campaigns in southern and northern governorates of Yemen.</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/who-emro-weekly-epidemiological-monitor-volume-12-issue-21-26-april-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/who-emro-weekly-epidemiological-monitor-volume-12-issue-21-26-april-2019</a></span></p> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>Evaluation of risk factors associated with drug-resistant tuberculosis in Yemen: data from centres with high drug resistance</p> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that Yemen has a high burden of drug resistance and a worrying shortage of implemented diagnostic methods and drug treatment regimens.

But while it’s understandable that US involvement is the top focus for the American left, understanding the war in Yemen requires a much broader analysis. The Yemeni conflict not only includes multiple outside actors but also multiple groups of Yemenis pursuing different outcomes, rooted in a complex history that a few outside of Yemen understands. </p> <p>Explaining that context is what this show, in partnership with the Middle East Research and Information Project (MERIP), is all about. This special episode includes two interviews with contributors to the Middle East Report, MERIP’s print publication. First, up is Yemeni journalist Afrah Nasser and political scientist Stacey Philbrick Yadav; and then, Dan speaks with political-economist Adam Hanieh.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/empire-and-the-war-in-yemen/">https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/empire-and-the-war-in-yemen/</a></p> <p>(* B K P)</p> <p>Rüstungswettlauf im Jemen-Krieg</p> <p>Die Huthis haben Saudi-Arabien mehrfach mit Raketen und Drohnen beschossen. Die Botschaft: Auch das Königreich ist verwundbar. Dort dürfte das nur wenig Eindruck machen. Eine neue Qualität der Gewalt ist wahrscheinlich.</p> <p>Drohnen wie die, deren Überreste in Saudi-Arabien gefunden wurden, seien relativ billig, sagt der <span><a href="https://www.focus.de/orte/irak/">irakische</a></span>Militärexperte und General Nazim Tawfiq im Gespräch mit der Deutschen Welle. Ihr Preis liege je nach Typ zwischen 300 und 3000 Euro. Neben den Drohnen könnten allerdings auch konventionelle Raketen eingesetzt worden sein, vermutet er. "Sanaa und Riad liegen ungefähr 1100 Kilometer auseinander. Die in Saudi-Arabien gefundenen Drohnentypen lassen sich aber nur über 200 Kilometer steuern. Darum liegt es nahe, auch den Einsatz anderer Waffentypen zu vermuten", so Tawfiq.</p> <p>Unabhängig davon, welche Waffen eingesetzt wurden, stellten die Angriffe der letzten Wochen auf jeden Fall eine weitere Eskalationsstufe dar, sagt der jordanische Waffenexperte General Mamun Abu Nawar. "Es handelt sich um eine grundlegende strategische Veränderung", so Aba Nawar im Gespräch mit der DW. "Die Huthis haben den Saudis durch den Angriff zu verstehen gegeben, dass ihr Land fortan nicht mehr sicher ist."</p> <p>Insgesamt hätten die Huthis durch den Einsatz von Drohnen ebenso wie von Raketen das militärische Kräfteverhältnis massiv zu ihren Gunsten verändert, so der jordanische Experte Abu Nawar. Das Abwehrsystem der Saudis - eine Patriot-Rakete kostet bis zu sechs Millionen US-Dollar - habe insgesamt Milliarden Dollar gekostet. Dennoch zeigt sich, dass es das Land nicht unverwundbar mache. Vergleichsweise billige Drohnen reichten, um es zumindest an einigen Stellen angreifbar zu machen.</p> <p>Der Einsatz der Drohnen und Raketen lasse vermuten, dass der Konflikt vor einer neuen Eskalationsstufe stehe, ergänzt General Tawfiq.

Save the Children versucht, den Teufelskreis aus Hunger und Krankheit zu durchbrechen. </p> <p>Inzwischen hat der Krieg dazu geführt, dass die Situation im Jemen als weltweit verheerendste humanitäre Katastrophe gilt. Große Teile des Landes sind zerstört. Es gibt keine funktionierende Gesundheitsversorgung mehr. Die Hälfte aller Kliniken ist zerstört, Ärzte und Medikamente sind kaum vorhanden. Von einem Schulbesuch können die meisten Kinder seit Langem nur träumen. Die Währung ist nichts mehr wert, Jobs sind Mangelware. Die Wirtschaft liegt am Boden.</p> <p>Das alles hat fatale Folgen. 80 Prozent der Bevölkerung – 24 Millionen Menschen – sind Tag für Tag dringend auf humanitäre Hilfe angewiesen. Fast die Hälfte von ihnen sind Kinder. Außerdem hungern die Jemeniten. 18 Millionen haben nicht genug zu essen. Vor allem Mädchen und Jungen sind oft lebensbedrohlich mangel- und unterernährt, sichtbar bis auf die Knochen abgemagert. Es fehlt ihnen an Kraft. Ihr Immunsystem ist schwach. Und das macht sie besonders anfällig für Krankheiten.</p> <p>Der Teufelskreis aus Armut, Hunger und Krankheit hat nach Schätzungen von Save the Children seit der Eskalation des Konflikts Ende März 2015 bereits 85 000 Kinder unter fünf Jahren das Leben gekostet. Dennoch versucht die Hilfsorganisation, diesen Teufelskreis auf verschiedene Weise zu durchbrechen. </p> <p>Viele Jemeniten wissen nicht, ob und woher sie ihre nächste Mahlzeit bekommen. </p> <p>Deshalb ist Nothilfe für sie Überlebenshilfe.

Despite facing death threats for her work, Huda Al-Sarari has no intention to stop.</p> <p>According to reports by human rights groups, more than 18,000 people have been thrown into secret prisons located in Yemen but run by foreign governments. The prisoners, accused of cooperation with terrorists, are routinely tortured and abused with no access to legal counsel nor hope for justice.</p> <p>An investigation based on the testimonies of those who managed to get out, their family members, human rights activists and local military officials, published by the Associated Press, stated that this clandestine network consists of about 18 detention centers hidden away at “military bases, airports and seaports, the basements of private villas and even a nightclub.” Ms. Al-Sarari contributed to another report, released by Human Rights Watch in June 2017, stating that least 49 people, including four children, were arbitrarily detained or forcibly disappeared over the last year.</p> <p>She’s been paying the price ever since the report was published. </p> <p>Her ordeal began immediately after she gave the first interviews to the media about torture in secret prisons.

That’s bad news for Saudi activists.</p> <p>Saudi women’s rights activist Malak al-Shehri fled to the United States a year ago amid a wave of arrests of other women who had advocated the right to drive. After the murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last October, it emerged that some of those women had been held in secret prisons and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/11/20/saudi-arabia-detained-women-reported-tortured">brutally tortured</a>. In the wave of international outrage that followed, a big question in Washington was whether Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who likely ordered both operations, would respond to Western entreaties to rein in his thugs.</p> <p>The past month has brought a decisive answer: no way. On April 4, Shehri’s husband, Ayman al-Drees, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/malak-al-shehri-speaks-out-after-saudi-arabia-detains-husband-n999976">was arrested on the couple’s farm</a> in Saudi Arabia, among at least 14 other people with ties to one of the imprisoned activists.

Clerics Salman al-Odah, Awad al-Qarni and Ali al-Omari are expected to be put to death once Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, ends on June 4.</p> <p>Madawi Al-Rasheed: Based on what I know, Saudi courts have not yet handed down the death sentence. But the public prosecutor is clearly considering the death penalty. The judiciary has brought 37 charges against cleric Salman al-Odah alone. The Saudi regime could exploit the <span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/americans-believe-war-with-iran-is-coming/a-48822649">tense political climate in the region</a></span> to carry out the death sentences — especially when it comes to allegations concerning ties to Qatar or conflicts with Iran. The three clerics are accused of terrorism and espionage, as well as being members of the Muslim Brotherhood. So once again, we're expecting to see death sentences — though nobody can know for sure.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia's approach toward executions speaks for itself. A month ago, 37 individuals were suddenly put to death.

They say it is a fundamental constitutional question about the power to authorize war.

Trump has been doing everything he can to ensure that nothing interrupts the flow of U.S.-made weapons to the war criminals in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, and the upcoming “emergency” declaration is just the latest example of how far he will go to cater to these governments.</p> <p>To continue arming the Saudis and Emiratis at this point is to knowingly provide war criminals with the means to commit more war crimes against innocent civilians – by Daniel Larison</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/trumps-bogus-emergency-to-arm-the-saudis-and-emiratis/">https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/trumps-bogus-emergency-to-arm-the-saudis-and-emiratis/</a></span></p> <p>(* A P)</p> <p>U.S. State Department misses deadline to explain Iran arms control report: aide</p> <p>The U.S. State Department failed to meet a deadline on Thursday to provide information to three congressional committee chairmen looking into whether an annual arms control report slanted and politicized assessments about Iran, a congressional aide said.</p> <p>In a May 16 letter, the Democratic chairmen of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence committees asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to provide a State Department briefing and documents no later than Thursday.</p> <p>The dissenting officials, sources said, were concerned that the document politicized and skewed assessments against Iran in a bid to lay the groundwork to justify military action.</p> <p>A U.S. official familiar with the issue and speaking on condition of anonymity said the chairmen were to be invited to a briefing by State Department and other government experts about the report on “adherence to and compliance with arms control, nonproliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments.”</p> <p>The congressional aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said no such communication had been received.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-armscontrol-idUSKCN1ST2VY">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-armscontrol-idUSKCN1ST2VY</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Trump and the Middle East: a Long Record of Personal Failure</p> <p>Many American presidents have blundered in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, but Donald Trump’s personal involvement in the region has been particularly disastrous.</p> <p>Trump has made numerous decisions that have compromised U.S. interests in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. In doing so, he rarely consulted any members of his national security team or offered any explanation for his policies. The past two years have produced a random pattern of actions that have unnecessarily rewarded the bellicose behavior of Israel and Saudi Arabia; decertified a seminal arms control treaty with Iran and then threatened war with Iran; prolonged an unwinnable military engagement in Afghanistan; and worsened an intense multi-national struggle among non-Arabs in Syria. Trump now heads a long list of American presidents who believed that U.S. problems in the region were susceptible to a military solution.</p> <p>Trump’s efforts to reshape U.S. foreign policy over the past two years have compromised most U.S. foreign policies, including those with traditional U.S. allies and alliances supportive of U.S. efforts regarding arms control and disarmament as well as conflict resolution – by Melvin A.

That does not make Sanders a pacifist; he has not opposed every call to arms. But he has generally been on the side of diplomacy as opposed to armed conflict.
