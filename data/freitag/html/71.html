Though maternal mortality still lies at the heart of maternal health indicators, there is a growing concern about the impact of mental and behavioural health on maternal health outcomes. World Health Organization (WHO) is proposing a stronger focus on mental health for an integrated delivery of services for Maternal- and Child Health (MCH). <br /> Aim: The overall aim is to gain insight into the experience of Yemeni women of modern and traditional care during childbirth, their perceived mental status and health care seeking patterns. The focus of the thesis is on women’s reproductive mental health in the context of culture and health care systems. <br /> Methods:</p> <p>A multi-stage (stratified-purposive-random) sampling process was used. Two hundred and twenty women with childbirth experience in five governorates – Aden, Lahej, Hadramout, Taiz and Hodeidah – were interviewed by means of a semi-structured questionnaire. Half of the women lived in urban, half in rural areas. Questions concerned the most recent pregnancy and childbirth (location, attendance and perceived quality); postpartum period; women’s empowerment and social and demographic information. A pre-test of the questionnaire was carried out in Taiz.</p> <p>Interviews were made by two Yemeni nurse-midwives and two medical doctors, one of whom was an obstetrician-gynaecologist, and one a Sudanese nurse-midwife. All women approached for an interview were initially explained about the purpose of the study and asked whether they would agree to participate. Interviews lasted for 1-3 hours. All performed interviews were discussed daily among team members.</p> <p>Results: A large majority of women perceived childbirth as a situation of danger. Fear of death and childbirth complications stemming from previous traumatic childbirth and traumatic experience in the community was rampant. Husbands’ and in-laws’ disappointment in a girl infant constituted a strong sociocultural component of fear. Women without fear gave reasons of faith, social belonging and trust in either traditional or modern childbirth practice, past positive experience of childbirth and the desire for social status associated with children (I). Women in areas with a matrilineal past who were often unassisted during childbirth experienced little fear (I, II).</p> <p>A graded negative association was found between the perceived authority of the woman in childbirth and the level of biomedical training of staff. Women who had their questions answered and requests met during childbirth had 83% higher probability to perceive their own authority and women who reported skin-to-skin contact/ newborn in arms 28% higher probability of not fearing birth (III). Three main themes explained their sense of authority: (i) ‘Being at the centre’; (ii) ‘A sense of belonging’ and (iii) ‘Husband’s role in childbirth’. Authority was experienced primarily among women within the traditional childbirth sector and among women with a matrilineal past (II, III). Women who had previously been able to follow their own individual choice in matters of childbirth were six times more likely to plan a future childbirth in the same location (IV). <br /> Conclusions: Women's perceived own authority during childbirth is decreasing in the context of Safe Motherhood and the expansion of modern delivery care. This is an important reason why women underutilize professional care. Antenatal care has an important role in reducing fear of childbirth including that of institutional childbirth and in strengthening a couple in welcoming a female infant. Yemeni women’s low utilization of modern delivery care should be seen in the context of their low autonomy and status. We call for cooperation between modern and traditional childbirth care. In areas of Yemen with a matrilineal past women’s choice of place of delivery does not seem to be influenced by a need for authority during childbirth.</p> <p><span><a href="https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/handle/10616/46740">https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/handle/10616/46740</a></span></p> <p>and thesis in full: <span><a href="https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10616/46740/Thesis_Annica_Kempe.pdf">https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10616/46740/Thesis_Annica_Kempe.pdf</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p> <p><strong>The Suffering Beyond the Stalemate: The Humanitarian Context in Serwah District</strong></p> <p>The people of Serwah in Marib governorate have suffered through more than four years of conflict, with an active frontline that continues to divide their land and block the main road through the district. This report attempts to provide a better understanding of the conditions present in Serwah, namely with regards to the humanitarian situation and the destruction of infrastructure that has occurred as a result of the hostilities. <br /> The research was conducted for the “Supporting Inclusive Peace-Making Efforts and Political Transition in Yemen” project funded by the European Union and implemented in partnership between DeepRoot Consulting and the Crisis Management Initiative (CMI). </p> <p>The information presented in this report is based on extensive interviews conducted in October and November of 2018 with locals from Serwah and Marib more generally, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), local authorities, and non-governmental organizations. These were accompanied by a desk review of studies issued by local NGOs, online data sources, and local news reports and interviews.</p> <p>Serwah is one of Marib’s 14 districts, located 40 km west of Marib city and known as “the main gate to Sana’a” because of its strategic location. Serwah is considered one of Marib’s major districts and it is divided into three sub-districts.</p> <p>Since early 2015, Serwah has been one of the most critical frontlines in the conflict between the Houthis and their allies on the one hand and the forces loyal to President Hadi on the other. From the local perspective, a key reason for the prolonged fighting in the district is that Serwah’s natives are split amongst themselves and divided between the main conflicting parties. The confrontations are concentrated in the center of the district, mainly in the Serwah sub-district [3] where Serwah’s central market (سوق] (1] is located, and across the spacious Sarawah plain.</p> <p>As a result of the conflict, local infrastructure has suffered significant damage. Residential homes and property have been subjected to thousands of indiscriminate airstrikes and shells, reducing public life to a near standstill. According to a joint study conducted by local NGOs, nearly 90 percent of Serwah’s population has been displaced, mostly to other areas within Serwah district itself, to Marib city [11], to other districts in the governorate, and to other governorates.</p> <p>Al-Amiri further stated that around 320 houses have been destroyed and at least dozens of others damaged. Moreover, the conflict has destroyed around twenty farms and fifty shops in Serwah’s central market area.</p> <p>Schools in Serwah have been subjected to shelling, and five schools have been destroyed.9 Serwah’s hospital and three health centers were damaged, causing residents to travel long distances.</p> <p>The humanitarian burdens the abovementioned damage and destruction has placed on local residents is exacerbated by impediments to travel. In addition to heightened petrol prices and general instability, ten vital roads were damaged, causing the disruption of traffic and forcing people to use alternative rough roads.</p> <p>As for Serwah, it was reported that there are around 3,476 families who are internally displaced within the district itself. Out of the IDPs in Serwah, it is estimated that around 85 percent of them are from Serwah and other district in Marib, while around 15 percent are from outside Marib.14 Residents of Serwah who have become displaced outside of the district have primarily relocated to Sana'a governorate, the capital secretariat (Sana’a city), and neighbouring Marib districts such as Marib city.</p> <p>Displaced people in Serwah live in unorganized gatherings.</p> <p>Before the fighting reached Serwah in 2015, locals were mainly dependent on farming, raising livestock, trade and government jobs as livelihood sources. Most people lost their livelihood sources as a result of the conflict. Since the conflict started, IDP interviewees suggested that many have joined the army (or as referred to ‘a government job’) as a source of income. However, the salaries they receive are inconsistent and irregular, usually arriving every three to four months.</p> <p>The recent field study on IDPs in Serwah showed that 66 percent of the IDP community has at least one member of their family who is working and among these working members, over 55 percent have government jobs.</p> <p>The IDPs in Serwah have received assistance from different local and international NGOs</p> <p>There are 427 schools in Marib governorate: 321 primary schools, 2 secondary schools, and 104 for both primary and secondary education. 22 Marib is said to have relatively strong education infrastructure compared to other governorates, and it was suggested that one of the main reasons for this is because of disputes among the tribes of Marib.</p> <p>Prior to the conflict, Marib governorate was already suffering from poor infrastructure on the health side.</p> <p>Currently, the governorate has only one public hospital that operates complex surgeries, Marib General Hospital Authority, and 5 central hospitals that have moderate operation capabilities.</p> <p>The field study on Serwah showed that 94 percent of the surveyed displaced families are not satisfied by the available health services, mainly because of their low quality.33 Moreover, there are complaints about the lack of free treatment, health guidance, and distribution of mosquito nets to prevent diseases. In addition to this, there is a need for greater treatment and support for those suffering from chronic diseases, critical cases, and those in need of a specialist in mental and neurological disorders. Conditions such as asthma, malaria, cholera, dengue fever, and skin diseases continue to develop among the displaced community, as well as disabilities resulting from the war among children.</p> <p>Part 4: Conclusion</p> <p>This report has aimed to address one of the gaps in publicly accessible research on the humanitarian impact of the conflict in Yemen at the local level, especially as it relates to internal displacement. The population of Serwah is not as large as other areas of the country that are more frequently featured in news headlines, and like other areas with small populations it is often dropped to the bottom of the priority list for international humanitarian assistance. However, the case of Serwah as presented in this report reflects the extent of the conflict’s impact across Yemen’s diverse communities, and the need for a more nuanced approach in designing humanitarian, peacebuilding, and stabilization interventions in Yemen – by Abeer Al-Mutawakel</p> <p><a href="https://www.deeproot.consulting/single-post/2019/04/24/The-Suffering-Beyond-the-Stalemate-The-Humanitarian-Context-in-Serwah-District">https://www.deeproot.consulting/single-post/2019/04/24/The-Suffering-Beyond-the-Stalemate-The-Humanitarian-Context-in-Serwah-District</a></p> <p>and full document: <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/df2b40_73d65c3871724c9eb95da71bdec0b7bc.pdf">https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/df2b40_73d65c3871724c9eb95da71bdec0b7bc.pdf</a></p> <p>(* A K)</p> <p>DAS JEMEN-PROJEKT: ANKÜNDIGUNG</p> <p>Bellingcat und das Global Legal Action Network (GLAN) kündigen heute die Veröffentlichung der ersten Untersuchungsrunde im Rahmen eines neuen Projekts zur Untersuchung der Kampagne von Luftangriffen an, die von einer von Saudi-Arabien geführten Koalition, einschließlich der Vereinigten Staaten, seit 2015 im Jemen durchgeführt wird.

HRW states “about 22:00” AST)</p> <p>KEY FINDINGS<br /> On the evening of 2015-07-04, an explosion occurred near a restaurant in <span><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/16%C2%B019'39.0%22N+43%C2%B005'22.2%22E/@16.3252865,43.0889097,375m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d16.3275!4d43.0895">Muthalith Ahim</a></span> injuring and killing multiple civilians.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that at least 65 people were killed and 105 wounded. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) reported on 2015-07-07 that there had been 20 deaths in a market in Harad district, where Muthalith Ahim is located, and that their team treated over 67 injured people.</p> <p>The HRW report titled: “<span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/11/26/what-military-target-was-my-brothers-house/unlawful-coalition-airstrikes-yemen">What Military Target Was my Brother’s House: Unlawful Coalition Airstrikes in Yemen</a></span>” provides a comprehensive narrative including eyewitness accounts of a number of alleged airstrikes that took place on the Muthalith Aahim (‘Aahim Triangle) and in the nearby village of Haradh. The attack we analyse in this report is the one referred to in the section of the HRW report titled “Muthalith Ahim”</p> <p>Open source information gathered and verified by investigators indicates that on the night of 2015-07-04 what was likely an aerial bomb detonated in Muthalith Aahim. This explosion killed and wounded a large number of people who appear to be civilians. The location at which this explosion took place was in the center of Muthalith Aahim, near restaurants, a hospital and other market stalls. There was also what appeared to be a water-truck several meters away from the point of detonation.</p> <p>– The incident occurred during the month of Ramadan in the evening. It is expected that a large number of people, locals and travellers, would have congregated in the restaurants to continue eating into the night, having broken their fast after the dusk prayers at the nearby mosque.</p> <p>– There appears to be some confusion over the number of munitions dropped due to other airstrikes occurring within that general area at the same time. Open sources only identify one crater and as such our analysis indicates only one munition was dropped on Muthalith Aahim which caused mass civilian casualties.</p> <p>WHERE?</p> <p>The incident took place in the Muthalith Aahim (‘Aahim Triangle) near the town of Haradh in the Hajjah Governorate. The “triangle” is formed at the point where the N2 Road (also marked as 5 Road and 45 Road) with a roughly North-South direction from the Saudi/Yemeni border, forks into two sections </p> <p>The HRW <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/11/26/what-military-target-was-my-brothers-house/unlawful-coalition-airstrikes-yemen">report</a></span> states that the area outside the restaurants was also used by qat sellers, a fishmonger, vegetable sellers, and mobile phone merchants. The report also contains an interview from a witness who stated that there were also about 50–60 African migrants and IDPs from the Saudi/Yemeni border in this area at the time. </p> <p>Who was operating in the area?</p> <p>The area is located within the governorate of Hajjah, which is a well-known stronghold of the Huthi movement and was considered to have been under their control at this time.</p> <p>A truck driver named Salem al-Mashwali was <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/11/26/what-military-target-was-my-brothers-house/unlawful-coalition-airstrikes-yemen">interviewed</a></span> by HRW and stated that Huthis were operating a checkpoint in the area, approximately 50 metres away from where the strike hit. This checkpoint was allegedly undamaged by the strike.</p> <p>The area appears to be of strategic significance to both sides and it has been the target of repeated attacks before and after this incident. </p> <p>WHAT DAMAGE WAS DONE?</p> <p>The people that appear in the <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEWzSaNC0G4&amp;has_verified=1">aftermath video</a></span> of the incident are dressed in civilian clothes and appear to be ordinary Yemenis. Nobody appears in a military uniform, however one of the interviewees appears to be wearing shoulder straps of some kind that appear similar to those of webbing or chest rig</p> <p>We can therefore state with confidence that the <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEWzSaNC0G4&amp;has_verified=1">aftermath video</a></span> shows a large number of casualties were at the scene of this incident. All casualties appear to be young men and all were wearing civilian clothes. No weapons are evident among the debris.</p> <p>We can also see a pick-up truck and what appears to be some kind of water-tanker which appears to have been parked within a few meters of the munition impact point.

We identified what we believe to be this prison in the report.</p> <p>The Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) stated it had targeted two weapon depots in Abs on 2015/05/13 that it claims were used by the Houthis. The JIAT also claimed that it did not target nor damage the Abs prison, and that the buildings it targeted were 900 meters and 1,300 meters away from the prison, respectively. We identified what we believe the SLC may believe is the prison in question.</p> <p>DISCOVERY</p> <p>The sources used in this report were found by searching for variations of “Abs” and “prison” in both English and Arabic across different search engines and social media platforms. Time limitations and advanced searches were used to search specific date ranges around the time of this incident. Searches on YouTube were conducted using the same keywords in both English and Arabic, and videos were filtered by date to aid identification.</p> <p>The following sources were discovered:</p> <p>WHERE?</p> <p>The incident took place in the town of Abs in the Hajjah governorate in Yemen. The structure which was allegedly hit is known as Abs Prison (also as Abs Shefr Prison, and Abs/Kholan Prison).</p> <p>Using satellite imagery, we identified three buildings that were almost completely razed in the town of Abs between 2014/01/27 and 2016/07/04. </p> <p>The majority of open sources appear to depict <span><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/15%C2%B059'55.7%22N+43%C2%B011'55.9%22E/@15.9988193,43.1983098,202m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d15.9988176!4d43.1988568">Building 1</a></span> or casualties from that location.

Due to the lack of open sources depicting Building 3 and Building 4, these locations require further investigation.</p> <p>WHAT HAPPENED?</p> <p>What was attacked?</p> <p>There are a large number of reports, whether from international organisations such as HRW, or from social media users in Abs (see DISCOVERY section), that an airstrike took place on the town using multiple munitions. Although virtually all reports mention a prison, a wide range of other buildings are also mentioned, including government offices, a school and a cultural center.

This implies those two targets were some distance from each other. The analysis above supports this, as it shows there was considerable destruction in the vicinity of the prison at Building 1, as well as at Building 2, which are 470 meters away from each other. </p> <p>Who was affected?</p> <p>Images of the casualties of this strike appear to be uniformly men.

With the exception of the JIAT statement, almost all open sources explicitly state that a prison had been bombed in the town of Abs. In this investigation we believe we may have identified the building that JIAT believes to be a prison. Between 13 to 40 people were killed in this strike, including children. Open sources appear to indicate these were civilians, including inmates at a prison.

What is your surname?” Years ago, this question was considered normal and could be answered without concern and without questioning the intentions of the person asking it. It was a question that was meant to make acquaintances and strengthen the links between members of society from different regions. However, it is now considered a trick question and its answer may lead to imprisonment.</p> <p>Ma’rib, which is controlled by Abd Rabbou Mansour Hadi government, has received many displaced people during the past four years of war who fled hell in other governorates, providing them with the livelihoods and services lacking in many areas of Yemen.</p> <p>But at the same time, the governorate installed guards at its gates to examine the identities of new comers who might be denied entry or even detained solely because of their surnames.</p> <p>A resident from Sana’a says: “We are afraid to enter Ma’rib because of our surnames.The ill could die with nothing we could do to provide medical assistance abroad due to the closure of Sanaa airport. Travelling to other airports pose numerous dangers because of the different checkpoints on the road.”</p> <p>For citizens coming from northern governorates, passing through Ma’rib is the only way to reach Seiyun airport in Hardhramaut in order to travel abroad especially since the Saudi/ Emarati-led coalition closed Sanaa international airport- the biggest in the country- since August 9, 2016. Travelers have to take long routes to reach Seiyun or Aden airport to be able to travel.</p> <p>Travelers pass through such routes which are controlled by the different parties to the conflict. Some of these routes are close to the points of engagement. Travelers are subject to searches and inspections in dozens of security and military checkpoints, which examine their papers, interrogate them about the reasons and destination of travel. Bab al-Falaj checkpoint is at the top of the list in interrogating people based on their surnames, and travelers may be even arbitrarily detained, and accused of any charge to justify their detention.</p> <p>Detainees at the Bab al-Falaj checkpoint, manned by Hadi government forces, are subjected to interrogation, humiliation, death threats and sometimes torture. Ibrahim (pseudonym), who was arrested in April 2017 at al-Falaj checkpoint, said interrogators kept asking him about the names of Houthi leaders who had the same surname as him. They tried to find out about his relationship with them. Ibrahim assured them that he knew nothing about them and that he was just a worker coming from Saudi Arabia to visit his children whom he missed.</p> <p>His belongings were searched and he was locked up in a small tight room with a large group of detainees and mentally ill people. He avoided eating the food he was given so that he would not have to enter the toilets that were not usable. Like other inmates, he was subjected to psychological and physical torture. He was threatened with death, beaten with whip and sticks and tied with chains. He was asked loudly about his name and family name, which was insulted. He was accused of entering Ma’rib as a fugitive. He was also accused of two false chargers: a murder charge and the charge of belonging to the Ansar Allah group (Houthis).</p> <p>Ibrahim and other detainees were released after nine months in an exchange of detainees. However, many innocent people are still being detained and are suffering behind bars not guilty.</p> <p>Cases of arrest because of the name at the Bab al-Falaj checkpoint in Ma’rib governorate are ongoing. Detainees usually belong to the commonly referred to as “Hashemite families” and are accused of supporting the Houthi group, which is also known as a Hashemite family. Mwatana for Human Rights has documented 38 arbitrary arrests and 22 enforced disappearances in Ma’rib governorate between 2015 and the end of March 2019. Many of these incidents occurred because of the family name only.</p> <p>Most of the exit points from Yemen have been closed, and corridors between its areas are surrounded by guards who detain people coming from certain areas on pre-prepared charges. People traveling are no longer afraid to take weapons or prohibited materials but rather most of them are afraid of their own names.</p> <p><span><a href="http://mwatana.org/en/bab-al-falaj-checkpoint/">http://mwatana.org/en/bab-al-falaj-checkpoint/</a></span></p> <p><span>Comment: </span>How about Abu Hashem checkpoint, the other main checkpoint in Baydha that Yemenis have to travel through on the road that links Sana’a with Marib/ Seiyun &amp; one where horrifying human rights violations take place?

The Authorization for Use of Military Force—which passed just three days after the attacks, with only one dissenting vote, and was followed by an expanded AUMF the following year—has been used to justify military actions <span><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/2001-aumf_n_5b9bc513e4b013b0977a1f83">in at least 20 countries</a></span> from the Sahel to the Pacific Rim.

Presidents as different in ideology and temperament as George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump have expanded what has been called <span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/49387/the-forever-war-by-dexter-filkins/9780307279446/">the Forever War</a></span>—and their own executive powers to wage it—even as all three initially ran on some version of a more humble foreign policy.</p> <p>Still, when I asked Bernie Sanders whether he would hope and expect Congress to rein in his ability to make war should he win the presidency, he didn’t hesitate. “Absolutely. Absolutely. Look, the Constitution is clear…. Congress has for a very long time abdicated that responsibility,” he said. “If I’m president, I will certainly be an advocate of that process.”</p> <p>Left-wing intellectuals and anti-war activists have long called for the United States to end its permanent war footing across the Muslim world and to reconsider its close alliances with illiberal governments, like those of Saudi Arabia and Israel. But such views are much rarer in Washington, where lawmakers like Sanders are only beginning to meaningfully challenge the status quo. Somewhere between these two perspectives—that of the progressive policy-maker and that of the radical critic—a new vision for America’s role in the world is being shaped. I went to Capitol Hill to explore why non-interventionists eager to realize this vision have homed in on one particular war. Yemen</p> <p>“I thought the Obama administration was totally wrong to launch a military partnership with Saudi Arabia that set the stage for the devastation that has become Yemen,” said Senator Chris Murphy, who was the first lawmaker to attempt to end US support for the war. Murphy’s campaign was initially a lonely one, beginning with a 2016 bill co-sponsored by libertarian-leaning Senator Rand Paul that focused on ending arms sales to the Saudis. Only 27 senators supported it.</p> <p>“I came here as a critic of this boneheaded US military intervention,” recalled Murphy</p> <p><span>A</span>t first glance, Democrats seem united on Yemen, having voted almost unanimously to end US support for the Saudi war. But this superficial consensus papers over real divisions on what progressive foreign policy should mean in a post-Obama, post-Clinton era.</p> <p>Perhaps the clearest difference between left-wing anti-war activists and Democratic lawmakers concerns the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p> <p>Shireen al-Adeimi, a Yemeni-born professor of education at Michigan State University <span><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/shireen-al-adeimi-interview/">who has become an outspoken advocate</a></span> against the war, is a case in point. She has been coordinating with Yemeni activists across the United States to lobby members of Congress since 2015. “They became much more clearly anti-intervention when it was no longer Obama’s war,” she said, adding that the scope of the humanitarian crisis was evident from the very start.</p> <p>Kizer identified Yemen as a key issue in mainstreaming progressive foreign-policy goals, in part because it’s less politically fraught than Israel-Palestine.</p> <p>“Yemen is a case of humanitarian non-intervention,” said Stephen Wertheim, a historian of international relations at Columbia University. “It marks a generational shift from the Samantha Power–esque humanitarian interventionism that sounded progressive a few decades ago but no longer does.” Power is a longtime advocate for military intervention to prevent genocide and human-rights abuses. “The Yemen campaign suggests the opposite principle: If we want to help suffering humanity, we should first and foremost make sure that the United States is not causing the suffering.”</p> <p>For now, any anti-war legislation is dead on arrival at the White House. Despite sometimes gesturing at a different approach while campaigning, as president, Trump has consistently deferred to some of the most hawkish voices in Washington, from Abrams to John Bolton, and has doubled down on the alliances with Saudi Arabia and Israel. At least for the next two years, Washington will continue to wage war across the Muslim world with few checks on the executive branch’s ability to do so. But depending on who succeeds Trump, perhaps the Forever War can finally end, as all wars eventually must – by David Klion</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/yemen-israel-palestine-washington-war-powers/">https://www.thenation.com/article/yemen-israel-palestine-washington-war-powers/</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>Yemen - Cholera (DG ECHO, UN, INGOs, media)(ECHO Daily Flash of 25 April 2019)</p> <p>Between 1 January and 13 April 2019, 214 798 suspected cholera cases and 445 associated deaths were recorded in Yemen. The highest number of suspected cases (31 126) since January 2018 was recorded in the first week of April.

Altogether there were 236,550 cases of suspected cholera between 1st January and 19th April 2019. Of these, 105,384 were in children under 15. Almost half these cases were recorded in the last month alone - nine times as many as in the same time period last year.</p> <p>Save the Children is warning that recent heavy rains, flash floods, fuel shortages and ongoing fighting despite the first steps towards a peace process in Stockholm last December, are adding to the chaos of four years of war to create perfect conditions for cholera to spread faster and further in the coming months.</p> <p>Fuel shortages and a spike in fuel prices are limiting the pumping of sewage, clean water supply and garbage collection. Many families have been unable to take their children to health facilities because they cannot afford the soaring cost of transport. Many people rely on buying clean water from trucks, but with the rising fuel prices the cost is increasing, forcing some people to turn to dirty water sources.</p> <p>Save the Children has warned that in places where fighting is continuing, the numbers could increase dramatically. It is feared that in Hajjah, in the northwest of the country, fighting could cut access to the only water source for 200,000 people who are already vulnerable to the disease because many have been displaced by conflict and face high levels of food insecurity.</p> <p>After an outbreak infected more than 1 million people in 2017, the disease was partially contained during 2018.</p> <p>This surge is yet more evidence that while the war rages there will be no end to the suffering of Yemen's children. Gains made against the disease in 2018 have unravelled in the face of relentless violence. Yet more people have been forced to flee their homes. Hunger and malnutrition are rampant. Vital health and sanitation services have been debilitated.</p> <p>In February the international community pledged $2.6 billion to the response to the war in Yemen - 65% of the money needed to meet humanitarian needs across the country.</p> <p>Yet two months later, those pledges have largely failed to materialise.</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-cholera-outbreak-100000-children-infected-start-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-cholera-outbreak-100000-children-infected-start-2019</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p>Aid groups act to stop Yemen's next major cholera epidemic</p> <p>In August 2018, Peter Salama, World Health Organization deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, told a UN briefing in Geneva that Yemen “may be on the cusp of the third major wave of cholera epidemics.” Yemen has already witnessed two major waves of cholera epidemics.</p> <p>According to Yemen's Ministry of Health, from January 2018 to April 2019, cholera is the suspected cause of at least 470 deaths.

All cases were admitted days ago. “Only six suspected cholera cases have been admitted Saturday [April 13] for the past three morning hours,” head of the center Yahya Omran told Al-Monitor.</p> <p>Huth’s main hospital has not only treated cholera, but also those wounded in the war, especially in 2014, during fighting between Houthi fighters and the sons of former parliamentary speaker Abdullah al-Ahmar.</p> <p>At the Huth cholera center, the last death occurred April 3. Hassas Naser Ahmed was from al-Ashah district, and was transferred to Huth hospital owing to bad health services in al-Ashah, according to Omran.</p> <p>There were four deaths at Khamir hospital in March, and one death at Huth hospital in February, according to Yahya al-Shuraimi, a medic at Huth hospital.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/04/yemen-cholera-outbreak-treatment-patients.html">https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/04/yemen-cholera-outbreak-treatment-patients.html</a></span></p> <p><span>(* A H)</span></p> <p>More than 100 cases of cholera have been received in Behan hospital in Shabwa and the local authority demanded rapid intervention from the specialized bodies</p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1121169751227682816">https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1121169751227682816</a></span></p> <p>(* A H)</p> <p>UNICEF &amp; partners have mounted a cholera vaccination campaign in 3 high risk districts in <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a></span> where there are currently over 236,000 suspected with 2,300 confirmed cholera cases (photos)</p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/BismarckSwangin/status/1121079789325041664">https://twitter.com/BismarckSwangin/status/1121079789325041664</a></span></p> <p><span>(A H P)</span></p> <p>PM launches environmental campaign to fight cholera epidemics</p> <p>Prime Minister Dr. Abdul Aziz bin Habtoor inaugurated Wednesday in Sanaa along with Minister of Water and Environment Nabil al-Wazir, Mayor of the Capital Sanaa Hamoud Abbad and Deputy Resident Representative of UNICEF the environmental campaign to combat cholera carriers in the districts affected by the epidemic in the capital and provinces.</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news534171.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news534171.htm</a></span></p> <p>My remark: Sanaa government MP.</p> <p>(A H P)</p> <p>Film: Activists: Houthis are prohibiting access to cholera drugs and vaccines</p> <p>Yemeni human rights activist Mohammed Al Amiri said that Houthis have prohibited the arrival of a shipment of cholera drugs and vaccines in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a, they also embezzled funds dedicated to facing and treating cholera</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEy5y7mF0Lc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEy5y7mF0Lc</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1b Am wichtigsten: Kampf um Hodeidah / Most important: Hodeidah battle</span></h2> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p>Lollesgaard leaves Hodeidah after the failure of the redeployment agreement</p> <p>Political sources reported the head of the Coordination Committee for the redeployment in Hodeidah, General Michael Lollesgaard left Hodeidah after the failure of implementing of the redeployment agreement.<br /> The same sources added that General Lollesgaard arrived on Thursday in the Jordanian capital of Amman, where the Office of the UN Envoy to Yemen is located.<br /> Other sources said that the Office of the UN Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths and the Yemen's internationally recognized government carried out intensive consultations on resolving all controversial issues and arrangements for the implementation of the first and second phases of the redeployment of troops in Hodeidah and its ports.</p> <p><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/4085">http://en.adenpress.news/news/4085</a></p> <p>and also <a href="https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-29435">https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-29435</a></p> <p><span> (A P)</span></p> <p>Hodeidah Governor to Asharq Al-Awsat: Houthis Emptied City’s Coffers</p> <p>Governor of Yemen’s Hodeidah province al-Hassan Taher accused on Thursday the Iran-backed Houthi militias of emptying the port city’s treasuries from cash and transferring the money to Sanaa.<br /> The militias have continued to violate the province’s resources to fund their war effort, he told Asharq Al-Awsat<br /> Separately, he said that the Yemeni government representatives in the Redeployment Committee should resume their meetings next week with Michael Lollesgaard, head of the UN Monitoring Committee on Hodeidah.</p> <p><span><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1696141/hodeidah-governor-asharq-al-awsat-houthis-emptied-city%E2%80%99s-coffers">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1696141/hodeidah-governor-asharq-al-awsat-houthis-emptied-city%E2%80%99s-coffers</a></span></p> <p>My comment: By the Hadi government’s governor.

It needs our spare parts and, more important, it buys our weapons because they come with an implicit guarantee that we will bail the Saudis out militarily if they get into trouble with Iran.”</p> <p>“That’s why we have leverage over Saudi Arabia, not the other way around.” The next step, he argued, should be a suspension of arms sales until Saudi Arabia ends its war in Yemen, for that war has made the US complicit in mass starvation.</p> <p>The Times said last year that some US lawmakers worry that American weapons were being used to commit war crimes in Yemen</p> <p><a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/2019/04/us-western-arms-yemen-conflict-signal-potential-war-crime-charges/">http://www.ipsnews.net/2019/04/us-western-arms-yemen-conflict-signal-potential-war-crime-charges/</a></p> <p><span>(* B K P)</span></p> <p>Saudi Arabia’s trail of foolishness, hypocrisy and mistakes from Syria to Yemen</p> <p>The Saudis and their allies are usually a puzzle when it comes to foreign policy. In their reaction to events in Yemen, they just look like bumbling fools.</p> <p>In other words, the plan that Saudi Arabia wrote for Iraq, Lebanon and Syria has happened to Yemen and destroyed one of Saudi Arabia’s own friends.</p> <p>Most amusing is the fact that the Saudis and their ideologues in the Arabic media are convinced that Iran is behind the fall of the Yemeni government and the success of the Houthi Movement’s Ansarullah paramilitary wing, effectively “taking over” Yemen. However, as <span><a href="https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/saudi-arabia-and-iran-compete-yemen">reported in an analysis at Stratfor</a></span>, Iran is simply too far away to really have any meaningful involvement in the conflict in Yemen.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, unlike Iran, has been bombing the factions it disagrees with in Yemen, killing hundreds of civilian bystanders, and has been airdropping weapons to the groups it wants to kill its enemies in the country. In sum, Saudi Arabia wants you to think some kind of invisible, unproven specter of Iranian connections in the sovereign country of Yemen is an “aggression”; lunatics like US Senator John McCain (see his remarks at the Munich Security Conference) and other anti-Iran maniacs also see Iranian influence in Yemen as aggression… but Saudi Arabia’s blatant airstrikes and airdrops of guns into the country are seen as necessary countermeasures to protect Yemen’s “sovereignty” from Iran.</p> <p>What is astonishing is that Saudi Arabia and its allies are crazy enough to simultaneously claim to be intervening in countries to keep “legitimate” presidents in power (like Yemen’s Hadi) and intervening in other countries to remove “illegitimate” presidents from power (as in Syria).</p> <p>Former president Hadi and the so-called Syrian opposition are not legitimate rulers of anything, but they do have one striking similarity: both are cowering in foreign capitals and suckling on foreign promises, while pretending to rule over their respective countries and denying that their people have rejected them. Cowering in Riyadh is what passes for being a “legitimate” ruler for Yemen in the eyes of Riyadh – by Harry J.

Fast ein Drittel der Todesfälle in der Klinik in Tais-Al-Huban waren Neugeborene, die bereits bei der Ankunft tot waren. Die Todesursachen bei den Neugeborenen waren vor allem Frühgeburt, Sauerstoffmangel bei der Geburt und schwere Infektionen.</p> <p>Die Kriegsparteien im Jemen und ihre internationalen Unterstützer haben den Zusammenbruch des öffentlichen Gesundheitssystems herbeigeführt, das die Bedürfnisse der 28 Millionen Menschen im Land nicht mehr decken kann.

The aim of this study was to explore FOC in a high maternal mortality setting in the Arab region, Yemen.</p> <p>METHODS:</p> <p>A multi-stage (stratified-purposive-random) sampling process was used. We interviewed 220 women with childbirth experience in urban/rural Yemen. Answers to the question 'Were you afraid of giving birth?' were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.</p> <p>RESULTS:</p> <p>Women perceived childbirth as a place of danger. Fear of death and childbirth complications stemming from previous traumatic childbirth and traumatic experience in the community was rampant. Husbands' and in-laws' disappointment in a girl infant constituted a strong sociocultural component of FOC. Women's perception of living in tension 'between worlds' of tradition and modernity reinforced fear of institutional childbirth. Women without FOC gave reasons of faith, social belonging and trust in either traditional or modern childbirth practice, past positive experience of childbirth and the desire for social status associated with children.</p> <p>CONCLUSIONS:</p> <p>The numerous maternal and infant deaths have a strong impact on women's FOC. Antenatal care has an important role in reducing fear including that of institutional childbirth and in strengthening a couple in welcoming a female infant. Staff should be sensitized to the fears of both husband and wife and women be allowed support during childbirth. Within the scope of the Millennium Development Goals and strengthening of reproductive mental health programs, FOC urgently needs to be addressed.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28596858">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28596858</a></span></p> <p>and full document: <span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-mental-health/article/exploring-womens-fear-of-childbirth-in-a-high-maternal-mortality-setting-on-the-arabian-peninsula/716EB67630610E02FB44CE64C57E9B47">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-mental-health/article/exploring-womens-fear-of-childbirth-in-a-high-maternal-mortality-setting-on-the-arabian-peninsula/716EB67630610E02FB44CE64C57E9B47</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5269624/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5269624/</a></span></p> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>Yemeni women's perceptions of own authority during childbirth: what does it have to do with achieving the Millennium Development Goals?</p> <p>FINDINGS:</p> <p>three main themes emerged from the analysis: (i) 'Being at the centre', including two categories 'being able to follow through on own wants' and its opposite 'to be under the authority of others'; (ii) 'A sense of belonging' with the categories 'belonging and support among women in the community' and 'the denial of support, the experience of separation' and (iii) 'Husband's role in childbirth' including one category 'opportunity to show authority over the husband'. Authority was experienced primarily among women within the traditional childbirth sector although a general complaint among women delivered by trained medical staff was the loss of own authority.</p> <p>KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:</p> <p>these findings show that women's authority during childbirth is decreasing in the context of Safe Motherhood and the expansion of modern delivery care. This is likely to be an important reason why women underutilise professional care. Acquisition of knowledge from the traditional childbirth sector regarding how women exercise authority to facilitate childbirth would constitute an asset to skilled delivery and Safe Motherhood. The findings from Yemen are likely to be relevant for other low-income countries with similar persistent high home delivery rates, low status of women, and high maternal mortality and morbidity rates.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23938165">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23938165</a></span></p> <p>and full document: <span><a href="https://www.midwiferyjournal.com/article/S0266-6138(13)00171-X/fulltext">https://www.midwiferyjournal.com/article/S0266-6138(13)00171-X/fulltext</a></span></p> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>Women's authority during childbirth and Safe Motherhood in Yemen.</p> <p>RESULTS:</p> <p>Women who had their questions answered and requests met during childbirth had 83% higher probability (95% CI 1.66-2.02) to perceive own authority. Women who reported skin-to-skin contact/newborn in arms had 28% higher (95% CI 1.03-1.59) and those who had more distant contact 15% lower (95% CI 0.75-0.95) probability. A graded negative association was found between the perceived authority of the woman in childbirth and the level of biomedical training of staff (p&lt;.0001). Women's social and demographic background played no role for their perceived own authority at birth.</p> <p>CONCLUSIONS:</p> <p>This paper argues that supporting Yemeni women to exercise their own authority during childbirth would significantly facilitate their ability to give birth successfully and with personal satisfaction. In a country where women are routinely disempowered, their personal empowerment at birth is very important to them. Skilled birth assistants often, in women's perceptions, work against their personal power and authority, most especially MDs but also midwives. This failure results in women failing to seek medical care when needed. Supporting women to experience their own authority at birth would facilitate the accomplishment of both the Millennium Development Goals and those of the Safe Motherhood Initiative. We call for increased cooperation between modern and traditional methods of care.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21122611">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21122611</a></span></p> <p>and full document: <span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877575610000431?via%3Dihub">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877575610000431?via%3Dihub</a></span></p> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>The Role of Demand Factors in Utilization of Professional Care during Childbirth: Perspectives from Yemen.</p> <p>METHOD:</p> <p>We interviewed 220 women with childbirth experience in urban/rural Yemen. We performed bivariate chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression analysis. A multistage sampling process was used.</p> <p>RESULTS:</p> <p>The issues of own choice, birth support and birth complications were the most important for women's preference of future location of childbirth. Women who had previously been able to follow their own individual choice regarding birth attendance and/or location of childbirth were six times more likely to plan a future childbirth in the same location and women who received birth support four times more likely. Birth complications were associated with a 2.5-fold decrease in likelihood.</p> <p>CONCLUSIONS:</p> <p>To offer women with institutional childbirth access to birth support is crucial in attracting women to professional care during childbirth. Yemeni women's low utilization of modern delivery care should be seen in the context of women's low autonomy and status.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21941663">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21941663</a></span></p> <p>and full document: <span><a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2011/382487/">https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2011/382487/</a></span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/wfp">World Food Programme</a>: Yemen mVAM Bulletin #36: August 2018 - Household food security in Yemen remains stable despite the continuation of the conflict as humanitarian assistance is reaching more people</p> <p>In August,overall food consumption remains stable as more household are receiving food assistance</p> <p>The use of negative coping strategies remains wide spread especially among displaced households</p> <p>Concerns persist over lack of food and income and the spread of diseases</p> <p><a href="https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/WFP-0000100147/download/">https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/WFP-0000100147/download/</a></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp4 Flüchtlinge / Refugees</span></h2> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p><span>Film: Displaced people from different areas of Hodeidah</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsdTPpthl5U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsdTPpthl5U</a></span></p> <p><span>My remark: By anti-Houthi militia channel, used for propaganda purposes.</span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p>68,000 families displaced amid fighting in Yemen's Hajjah: UN</p> <p>Ongoing fighting in Yemen's northwestern border province of Hajjah has resulted in 68,000 internally-displaced families since the beginning of this year, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Yemen (UNOCHA) said on Thursday.</p> <p>"Between mid-February and mid-March, an estimated 8,400 families were displaced from Kushar District as a result of clashes between Hajour tribesmen and the de-facto authorities (Houthi rebels)," the UN agency said.</p> <p>"At the end of March, fighting (between Houthi rebels and Saudi-led coalition forces) in Midi and Hayran led to the displacement of 17,000 families from Bani Hassan sub-District.

It’s only February, but the temperature is getting close to 30 degrees. Inside the tents, the heat is almost unbearable. In these conditions live widowed Ahlam, 27, and heavily pregnant Rana, 20.</p> <p>That is it like to be a young mother and displaced in Yemen?</p> <p>“There were heavy clashes near our house, and we couldn’t go out to fetch food or water.”</p> <p>Ahlam welcomes us in her tent in Al-Garad, one of the many displacement camps in southern Yemen. Her voice cracks.</p> <p>“One day my husband went out to his regular work in a construction site. A number of bullets hit his body and took his soul from us.”</p> <p>Inside the small tent, her youngest daughter, Adyan, cuddles up in her mother’s lap.</p> <p>It’s been just over a year since Ahlam took her four children and fled their home city Taiz. “While fleeing, I was afraid that bullets and snipers in the mountains would kill us if we got too close,” she says.</p> <p>Eventually they arrived in Al-Garad displacement camp, which was established in 2016 and houses almost 60 displaced families. Although the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and the World Food Programme (WFP) have distributed some food in the camp, the people in the camp still suffer from a lack of food.</p> <p>Ahlam sometimes goes hungry for days so that her children have enough to eat.</p> <p>Ahlam dreads the upcoming summer. Fiery winds will make the air denser and life in the camp even more difficult for the young family, and it will be almost impossible to move outside under the scorching sun.</p> <p>In the camp, we’ve built tents and latrines for hundreds of families. But the conditions in the camp remain harsh: It’s cramped, and there is no sound proofing between the tents. The heat is almost unbearable, it’s windy, and the air is sandy. There are insects, snakes and scorpions.</p> <p>The people in the camp lack many things: “We need more food and water, as well as fans. I don’t know how we’ll survive this heat without,” says Rana. Al-Mishqafa camp is located in the desert, and the heat is already extremely uncomfortable (photos)</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2019/young-mothers-in-war-torn-yemen/">https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2019/young-mothers-in-war-torn-yemen/</a></span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p> <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/iom">International Organization for Migration</a></span>: Flow Monitoring Points | 2018 Migrant Arrivals and Yemeni Returns from Saudi Arabia in Feb 2019</p> <p>Displacement Tracking in Yemen includes the monitoring of key migrant and return locations on Yemen's northern border with Saudi Arabia and southern coastal border.

The court sentenced 14 of the defendants to death in June 2016, and an appeals court upheld the verdict in May 2017. The court sentenced nine others to prison terms of between three and 15 years and exonerated one defendant.</p> <p>Eleven of the executed men were part of the <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/17/saudi-arabia-spy-trial-mockery-justice">Iran spy case</a></span>, which involved 32 defendants. They were accused of offenses constituting “high treason,” including meeting with Iranian “intelligence agents” </p> <p>Taha al-Haji, a Saudi lawyer who represented a group of the “Iran spy case” defendants until March 2016, told Human Rights Watch that authorities held the men incommunicado for three months before allowing phone calls and visits with family members.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/24/saudi-arabia-mass-execution-37-men">https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/24/saudi-arabia-mass-execution-37-men</a></span></p> <p>My remark: Earlier reporting: Yemen War Mosaic 530, cp8. – and as reminders: <span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/10/saudi-arabia-10-things-you-need-to-know-about-a-kingdom-of-cruelty/">https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/10/saudi-arabia-10-things-you-need-to-know-about-a-kingdom-of-cruelty/</a></span> and <span><a href="https://twitter.com/RaniaKhalek/status/1121017286243098625">https://twitter.com/RaniaKhalek/status/1121017286243098625</a></span></p> <p>And</p> <p><strong>(** A B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Saudi Arabia executions: A cruel travesty of justice</strong></p> <p>The killings will not put an end to the peaceful protest and activism of the Saudi Shia community, which has been struggling for equality for over half a century</p> <p>Travesty of justice</p> <p>At least<span><a href="http://time.com/5576102/saudi-arabia-execution-terrorism-crimes/"> 34 of the executed prisoners</a></span> are Shia activists, professionals, religious scholars and a number of young men who were detained when they were minors. This amounts to a brutal attack on Saudi Arabia's Shia.</p> <p>The community must be in shock and mourning its loss. Many of the young Shia prisoners were detained as early as 2011, when many in the Eastern Province <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27619309">staged an uprising</a></span> demanding the release of their political prisoners. </p> <p>This act of mass punishment is a travesty of justice for many reasons. First, a political system that subjects the judiciary to its absolute power cannot be trusted to deliver real justice.</p> <p>Secret trials undermine the credibility of the Saudi justice system. Furthermore, confessions under torture, a common practice in such high-profile executions, amount to nothing but injustice, yielding unreliable statements from prisoners, and is in stark violation of human rights.</p> <p>But of course, the Saudi regime does not give great attention to such details and, without the regime being held accountable, no one can challenge the abysmal state of Saudi prisons and what goes on behind closed doors. </p> <p>The T word</p> <p>Second, lumping all executed prisoners under the charge of terrorism mitigates against any criticism of the government’s decision, particularly King Salman, who has to sign the death sentences before they are carried out.</p> <p>In fact, any criticism of such a massacre, conducted behind closed doors and displayed to the public in the case of the crucifixion, faces a deluge of Saudi trolls justifying the executions on grounds of terrorism and even accusing the critic of sympathising with terrorism.</p> <p>In the unlikely situation that a Western government expresses doubt, concern or mild reservations about the large number of executions, the Saudis will revert to the justification that this is exactly what the West expects, namely an iron fist to end terrorism.</p> <p>The Saudi regime thinks of itself as the vanguard against terrorism, as a participant in the "War on Terror" and the international coalition against the Islamic State. Mass executions of terrorists should be welcomed rather than questioned, it believes. Vague terrorism charges have truly become an umbrella under which an opaque judiciary and a hawkish regime silences dissent. </p> <p>Containing Iran?</p> <p>Finally, it is important to point out the political context of the recent executions. US President Donald Trump entrusted Saudi Arabia with the task of containing Iran, so in addition to its cherished role in fighting terrorism, the Saudi regime is considered in Washington an indispensable ally against the regime in Tehran.</p> <p>The execution of Shia prisoners on this scale can be interpreted as part of "fighting Iran" in an obscure and convoluted way. </p> <p>But Iran will not be affected by this mass murder.</p> <p>However, the real victims of the Saudi injustice on 23 April are Saudi Shia, who represent a minority on the edge. Regardless of how much they show respect and endorsement of the Saudi regime, they seem to be always accused of loyalty to Iran – by Madawi al-Rasheed</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/saudi-arabia-executions-cruel-travesty-justice">https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/saudi-arabia-executions-cruel-travesty-justice</a></span></p> <p>and</p> <p><strong>(** A B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Saudi Arabia sends 'a message of fear' with mass execution, says dissident</strong></p> <p>Gulf Institute director Ali Al-Ahmed says many of 37 people killed were young activists and protesters</p> <p>Their crimes were unclear — but their sentences were swift and brutal.</p> <p>Many of them were simply young activists and protesters, says Ali Al-Ahmed, a Saudi dissident and director of the Gulf Institute think-tank.</p> <p>Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off.</p> <p>What do you know about the scene that unfolded yesterday in Saudi Arabia when these executions took place? </p> <p>Usually these executions take place in public. But we have no indication they were carried in public. Mostly they were carried inside prisons and by beheadings and dismemberment.</p> <p>One individual was dismembered and displayed for the public.</p> <p>The number is staggering. The thought of this is just incomprehensible. But I want to maybe try to put a bit of a human face on what happened [Tuesday] and a couple of the people I know you're familiar with or you know who were executed. Can you tell us about Abdullah Al Suraih? </p> <p>Most of the people who were executed are young people. They are in their early twenties.</p> <p>Abdullah Al Suraih is one of them. He's not even 22 and he comes from a poor family. [He] lived in a shanty house, very close to the oil port Ras Tanura.</p> <p>He was one of the leaders of the protest. He gave speeches in these protests, although he doesn't have much education because of the Saudi deprivation.</p> <p>And the goal of these protests were equality, were job opportunities, were end of oppression and shooting.</p> <p>And he made a video, did he not? </p> <p>He made several videos. One of them speeches ... during demonstration. He made a video showing ... his residence where he lived with his mother and younger brothers and sisters.</p> <p>So he was beheaded yesterday, as was Mujtaba Al-Sweikat. Can you tell us about him? </p> <p>Before these men, these 37 people, were executed, did they have anything like a trial? Did they have representation? I understand there were confessions, probably extracted by torture. Was any of that reviewed in any kind of legal context?</p> <p>The Saudi court system is abysmal. It does not belong to this modern time. </p> <p>If you are a Shia or black or a secular individual, let alone be a woman, you're not allowed to be part of that court system.</p> <p>And the judges who render these judgments, they do it under orders of the Saudi government. They are part of it.</p> <p>The decision is already made. It's a kangaroo court in many ways.</p> <p>Finally, the vast majority of these men who were executed were of the Shia Muslim minority.

What will it take for the west to speak up?</p> <p>Despite the bloodshed under the crown prince’s tenure, and last night’s mass execution, the response from Downing Street and the Foreign Office have been muted</p> <p>These appalling killings were the most recent in a series of atrocities that have seen a further erosion of human rights for Saudi citizens.</p> <p>It might be tempting to look back at the photoshoots and Hollywood handshakes of last March as an act of naivety, but even that soft power has real life consequences.</p> <p>One of the reasons the crown prince has been able to maintain his authoritarian rule is because of the support he has received on the world stage. Some of that is the concrete and practical support he has received from rulers like Trump and May, but much of it is the power he has gained from positive influence and associations.</p> <p>Both repression and the crisis in Yemen were underway when the crown prince was touring the world last year, but that didn’t stop world leaders and celebrities from posing for photos and legitimising him.</p> <p>The main thing that has changed since then is that more people are talking about those abuses, making things more embarrassing for those who have endorsed him in turn.</p> <p>If there is one thing that might force change, it is international pressure. That is why campaigners, such as ALQST, an international Saudi human rights group, <span><a href="https://alqst.org/eng/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Human-Rights-in-Saudi-Arabia-in-2018_En_Finel.pdf">have called on</a></span> the world to condemn the Saudi authorities’ continuing and escalating abuses. At the top of that list should be those who were all too happy to welcome him a year ago.</p> <p>Despite the bloodshed of the crown prince’s tenure, and last night’s mass execution, the response from Downing Street and the Foreign Office have been muted.

A history of these disagreements illustrates how shifting priorities and circumstances have caused the specifics of congressional opposition to vary, while also demonstrating that certain structural elements of the relationship have consistently driven underlying congressional unease.</p> <p>1932-1971: The Early Days</p> <p>1971-1989: Growing Congressional Scrutiny</p> <p>1989-2001: Relative Stability After the Gulf War</p> <p>2001-2014: 9/11 and the Development of a New Security Relationship</p> <p>2015-Present: The Current Security Relationship and Saudi Arabia’s Campaign in Yemen</p> <p>As this history demonstrates, the fact that Congress and the president are at odds over U.S. security policy toward Saudi Arabia is not a new development in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. In the current dispute, Congress is leveraging several old tools for influencing security policy—including opposition to arms sales under the AECA and restrictions on foreign assistance—and previously unused tools, such as the War Powers Resolution.</p> <p>Congress’s specific objections to the U.S.-Saudi security relationship reflect contemporary concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.

There is no “Iranian threat” in Yemen. Whom or what Iran actually should “threat” there? The US or Saudi or UAE threats (just speaking of foreign forces) in Yemen are much more relevant than any supposded threat from Iran. – “Hehran’s terrorist regime”: Saudi Arabia is a much more “terrorist regime” than Iran ever was, and the US itself in many respects even will outmatch Saudi Arabia here. – “</span>restore security and stability”: As a warring party in the Yemen War, the US had achieved exactly the opposite, and will continue this way. – “international interests” is US interests. And by mentioning this, Mr. Hook is telling us that US interests would weigh heigher than any Yemeni interest of self-determination. This is unacceptable. Any nation could determine its regime by itself. And what the US is claiming in the case of Yemen here, it also claims for evewry country on this planet. – The greatest threat to international navigation in the Bab Al Mandeb street are a) Saudi war ships pounding the Yemeni coast and b) the Saudi blockade against Northern Yemen. – <span>Brian Hook is Trump’s anti-Iran hawk: </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hook">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hook</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/bureau/271414.htm">https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/bureau/271414.htm</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/brian-hook-is-trumps-point-man-on-iran-and-under-investigation">https://www.thedailybeast.com/brian-hook-is-trumps-point-man-on-iran-and-under-investigation</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/2019/01/interview-brian-hook-call-iran-regime-kleptocracy/">http://www.ipsnews.net/2019/01/interview-brian-hook-call-iran-regime-kleptocracy/</a></span><span>: What is the US, please???

The war, occurring the most secluded and oil-poor corner of the Arabian Peninsula, seems, to many, tangential to American interests. Supporters of US involvement, such as former Bush administration official Michael Doran, counter that assessment, accusing critics of failing ‘to say anything about the Iranian role and the American interest in seeing Iran driven from Yemen’. But the Yemen conflict is not about Iran. It’s about Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Follow the money. </p> <p>The US-Saudi partnership is already controversial in America. According to Gallup, 77 percent of Americans hold an unfavorable view of the country. American and Saudi values are antithetical.</p> <p>President Trump’s steadfastness with Saudi Arabia is curious. Trump, as a private citizen, had called Saudi Arabia ‘the world’s biggest funder of terrorism’.</p> <p>Given the toxic nature of Saudi Arabia, supporters would rather focus on Iranian involvement anyway. But the Houthis are superfluous to Iran. The Houthis are a nice cudgel with which to threaten Saudi Arabia, but not a vital Iranian interest. Otherwise, Iran would be spending more.</p> <p>The same is not true for the Saudis. As Princeton lecturer Bernard Haykel notes, the Saudis view the war as ‘an attempt by the Iranians to create a Hezbollah-like force in Yemen on their southern borders’, creating ‘a national security threat to the Saudis through missiles, like Hezbollah does with Israel’.</p> <p>But why should America care? The prevailing wisdom concerns oil. </p> <p>Now, amid a <span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-hits-six-month-high-as-u-s-ends-waivers-on-iran-oil-imports-11555942199">price surge</a></span> following President Trump’s ending of exemptions to the Iranian oil embargo, the US is again using arms to keep the Saudi oil flowing and keep prices stable. The president has tweeted that that the Saudis ‘will more than make up the oil flow difference’.</p> <p>Appeasing Saudi Arabia, then, is the more convincing rationale behind continued American involvement in Yemen. Given the ire the kingdom has raised in America, and President Trump’s political vulnerabilities, it is hard to say how politically sustainable this support can be. It is, however, an oddly supine position that the ‘America First’ president now finds himself in – by Paddy Ryan</p> <p><span><a href="https://spectator.us/us-yemen-iran-saudi-arabia/">https://spectator.us/us-yemen-iran-saudi-arabia/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Trump’s Yemen veto damages America’s image around the world</p> <p>Trump’s veto is thus overt approval of the escalations carried out by the coalition, even its breaches of international law. It signals that the US administration does not oppose the coalition’s bombings and blockade of civilians. Moreover, the veto also demonstrates that having <a href="https://www.news24.com/World/News/14-million-on-brink-of-famine-in-yemen-charities-20181108">14 million Yemenis at risk of famine</a> and a rising death toll is not enough to make Washington think again end its support for the coalition.</p> <p>If Donald Trump really wants to “make America great again” then he should have been mindful of the suffering of innocent civilians in Yemen in which his country has been complicit, and allowed the Congressional resolution to pass. However, it is apparent that the economic ties between the United States and Saudi Arabia ensured that such an outcome was never going to happen. Such ties take precedence in Trump’s eyes.</p> <p>“President Trump has thrown his lot behind Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s role in the Yemen War with his support,” the Director of Research at the Arab Centre in Washington DC, Dr Imad Harb, told me. “While he believes that Congressional action should not limit his constitutional prerogative of deciding foreign policy, his main concern is maintaining his close relationship with the leaderships in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190426-trumps-yemen-veto-damages-americas-image-around-the-world/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190426-trumps-yemen-veto-damages-americas-image-around-the-world/</a></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Donald Trump's Yemen veto runs roughshod over the Constitution</p> <p>President Donald Trump’s recent veto of a congressional resolution about Yemen yielded a result contrary to what is intended by our constitutional order.</p> <p>The Constitution designates the president as commander in chief. But the authority to declare war was vested in Congress.</p> <p>Although the Federalist Papers do not elaborate on it at length, the intended division of labor is clear. Congress decides when to fight. The president decides how to fight.</p> <p>What happened with the Yemen resolution exposes a gaping flaw in this constitutional shortcut.</p> <p>The United States is assisting Saudi Arabia with its military campaign in Yemen.</p> <p>There’s an easy way to illustrate the fatuousness of this claim. Assume the same actions were targeted at the United States.</p> <p>If some country was providing bombing targets within the United States to a hostile power, or refueling bombers on their way to drop them, would we regard that as an act of war? Of course we would.</p> <p>While the practice of formally declaring war has fallen into desuetude, the constitutional principle remains: Congress, not the president, decides when we fight. And what we are doing in Yemen constitutes fighting.</p> <p>Regardless, the exercise of independent judgment is laudatory.

The deterioration of the Yemeni riyal, the scarcity of fuel, and the high cost of shipping insurance have all lead to an unmanageable increase in the basic commodity prices, and consequently the price of holiday clothes, meat, or the cost of furnishing a house. These unbearable economic pressures are widespread throughout the parts of Yemen not currently in conflict; the situation in active conflict areas is much more complex, since basic food security is essentially lacking.</p> <p>For the past three years, the costs of celebrating Ramadan have become increasingly taxing as the Yemeni riyal has collapsed: the Yemeni riyal was exchanging at 340 to the dollar in Ramadan 2017, then at 491 in Ramadan 2018. Now, during the first quarter of 2019, the exchange rate is at about 588 riyals to the dollar. The Yemeni riyal has also deteriorated against the Saudi riyal</p> <p>The deterioration of the Yemeni riyal, along with other factors, has also led to an increase in the prices of those goods and services that are available. The price of flour (for a bag of 10 kg) was 1500 riyals in Ramadan 2017, and raised to 2000 YR the next year and at approximately 2500 YR during the first quarter of 2019. The price of rice for a 40 kg bag also rose from 15,200 YR (Ramadan 2017) to 22,200 YR (2018) to 31,131 YR during the first quarter of 2019. Moreover, prices have risen more than average in some provinces.</p> <p>Although rising prices are a source of worry, fuel and cooking gas shortages, along with electricity blackouts, are greater concerns for the population. Especially as temperatures rise during Ramadan, a lack of fuel can make fasting unbearable.</p> <p>Even as the general Yemeni economy collapses, the war economy and corruption are thriving through practices of both the Houthi rebels and the legitimate government. The Houthis' control of state resources has only increased the economic challenges Yemenis are likely to face. According to a <span><a href="https://undocs.org/ar/S/2019/83">UN report in 2018</a></span>, at least 407 billion YR may be under the control of the Houthis due to their regular collection of corporate revenues and licensing fees applied to telecommunications, tobacco, and other goods and services.</p> <p>Corruption and war economy activities among individuals and entities of the legitimate government include the corruption and the possibility of a <span><a href="https://undocs.org/ar/S/2019/83">transfer</a></span> of public funds originally allocated for the production of electricity in the government-controlled areas of Aden, Lahj, and Abyan. In addition, there are large discrepancies between the volume of fuel cited in the tender documents and the amount of fuel subsequently directed to the power plants in 2017.</p> <p>Staying away from the Houthi conflict and limiting federal government control has created a more prosperous economic situation in Marib and has turned it into a go-to destination for deserters from the conflict zones.

          Yuval Harari ist einer der erfolgreichsten Sachbuchautoren der Welt. Von der „Kurzen Geschichte der Menschheit“ wurden in Deutschland über eine Millionen Exemplare verkauft. Nun erscheint der Weltbestseller als Graphic Novel: Harari noch zugänglicher und unterhaltsamer, aber genauso intelligent und lehrreich - ein Muss nicht nur für seine Fans.
