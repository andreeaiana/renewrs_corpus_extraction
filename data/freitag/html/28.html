The ideological struggle across the region between Saudi Arabia’s Salafi Wahhabism and Iran’s Shia Islam is partly based on the Wahabbi interpretation of the Shia sect as heretical. However, it does not fully explain the pattern of allegiances in the Yemen civil war. A more in-depth examination of religious identities within the Houthi movement disproves the superficial observation of the conflict as sectarian in nature. </p><p>First, the majority of Houthis practice Zaydism, an ideologically distinct sect from the Twelver Shiism that serves as the official doctrine of Islam in Iran. The Zaydis view themselves as a wholly separate sect within Islam and one that more closely resembles Sunni doctrine than Shia.</p><p>According to <span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-u-n-envoy-says-yemen-political-deal-was-close-before-saudi-airstrikes-began-1430081791">an April 2015 article</a></span> in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, Yemen’s various factions driving the civil war at the time were on the verge of signing a deal before unprovoked Saudi-airstrikes derailed the negotiations. The question, then, is not why the civil war originally broke out. Nor is there a question as to what the effects of the civil war in Yemen will be. The question worth asking is: <em>Who stands to benefit from the continual fueling, participation, and organization of a war that threatens to destabilize Yemen irreversibly?</em></p><p>The answer is one that exposes a myriad of foreign interests such as the U.K., U.S., and their perennial bedfellow, Saudi Arabia. This coalition stands in opposition to Iranian interests in the region as well. Only if one views Yemen as an untapped geopolitical weapon do the seemingly sporadic actions in the civil war begin to make any sense. Yemen has become a battleground for regional dominance by international actors split broadly into three categories: the Saudi-backed Hadi coalition, the Iranian-backed Houthi coalition, and independent competitors for territory such as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). An assessment of each role-player uncovers the incentive for a destabilized and, therefore, an easily-manipulated Yemen. </p><p>Saudi Arabia is the most visible foreign interest at play in the war. Before the events of the 2011 Arab Spring, Saudi fears over Yemen’s stability climaxed when the Ansar Allah movement mounted several challenges to the central authority in Yemen. The active rebellion emerged primarily as a result of socio-economic grievances in northern Yemen. The rise of the Houthi-led movement prompted military intervention by <span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26390311?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">Saudi Arabia</a></span> for the first time in decades. However, the operation backfired on the Saudi Kingdom as the military failed to make meaningful advances in the region. </p><p>Former rivals such as the Houthi insurgency and the Hiraak southern separatist movement joined forces to unseat President Saleh. Sensing an opportunity to gain control of the region, the Saudi Kingdom formulated a transitional plan that would replace Saleh with a government unopposed to Saudi interests. Nowhere was this more evident than in the uncontested election which now-President Hadi won. But what interests would be furthered by increased Saudi presence in Yemen? Aerial bombardment by the Saudis has destroyed much of Yemen, but it is worth noting that the eastern Hadramawt region has remained relatively unscathed. The strategic bombing is a telling clue as to the motives behind Saudi intervention. </p><p>The magnetic pull of Hadramawt on the Saudis lies in their ambition to construct an oil pipeline through the region. Saudi Arabia’s pipe dream was laid bare in a <span><a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08SANAA1053_a.html">leaked</a></span> cable which revealed that “A British diplomat based in Yemen told PolOff that Saudi Arabia had an interest to build a pipeline, wholly owned, operated and protected by Saudi Arabia, through Hadramaut to a port on the Gulf of Aden, thereby bypassing the Arabian Gulf/Persian Gulf and the straits of Hormuz. Saleh has always opposed this. The diplomat contended that Saudi Arabia, through supporting Yemeni military leadership, paying for the loyalty of shaykhs and other means, was positioning itself to ensure it would, for the right price, obtain the rights for this pipeline from Saleh’s successor.”</p><p>Herein lies the overarching aim behind Saudi Arabia’s involvement in perpetuating the civil war. Some skeptics may excuse this action as long as Yemen recovers, but the Saudi’s indifference to the interests of the Yemeni people is evident in their relations with AQAP. The Saudi-coalition has typically avoided any confrontation with the AQAP, using the terror group as an ally against the Houthi’s, as well as a potential check on ISIS forces. This method is a familiar ploy of the Saudi regime and mirrors its support of Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria as a proxy ally in fighting the Shia government of Bashar al-Assad and ISIS. Saudi support of AQAP has emboldened the organization, which had been largely eradicated by the Houthi insurgency.</p><p>The U.S. has been complicit in indirectly funding Saudi operations in Yemen. </p><p>The reasons for continued intervention in Yemen were outlined by U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo in a <span><a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1109-pompeo-memo-arms-sales/0300852ef550787be7dc/optimized/full.pdf">letter</a></span> to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 2019. Pompeo stated: “Iranian malign activity poses a fundamental threat to the stability of the Middle East and to American security at home and abroad.” He added that Iran had “directed repeated attacks on civilian and military infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the UAE by Iranian-designed explosives-laden drones and ballistic missiles fired by the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, who receive financial, technical, and materiel support from Iran.”</p><p>With American and British military personnel <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/15/british-us-military-in-command-room-saudi-strikes-yemen">working</a></span> in the command center with the Saudi-coalition, it is clear that the American and British governments’ respective involvement is anything but passive. The rapid mobilization of resources in support of the Saudi-coalition comes as a response to increased Iranian influence, which threatens U.S. and U.K political interests in the region. </p><p>The UAE has also entered the fray. The reasons for UAE involvement in the Yemen civil war is <span><a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20190917_R43960_0ae8aef063532aa48081bbedecd442b10277aa42.pdf">multifaceted</a></span>. The UAE’s co-operation with the Saudi coalition opens the path for further collaboration with the U.S. in combating terrorist groups such as AQAP in southern Yemen.</p><p>The UAE also wishes to check the rise of Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood. Yemen’s brand of the Sunni Islamist movement, Al-Islah, has become a key player in Yemen, and its alignment with the Saudi coalition has sparked fear in the UAE.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, sensing a dangerous threat to its broader aim of overthrowing the Houthis, intervened to ensure that the STC would commit to fighting the Houthi’s. After the fight for control of Aden subsided, the STC decided to align with the Saudi-coalition and handed back some power to the Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) forces. Control of the Aden government remains firmly under STC control with the Hadi-government ruling only as a proxy to the UAE-Saudi coalition. Involvement in southern Yemen has allowed the Gulf nation to exercise control over several of Yemen’s port cities, which benefits UAE commercial and energy interests. Herein, lies the Gulf country’s predominant reason for entering the conflict.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/12/18/who-are-the-houthis-and-why-are-we-at-war-with-them/">Some</a></span> have seen Iran’s direct and indirect involvement in Yemen as an attempt to create an armed, stateless, non-Sunni actor that could be advantageous to Iran as a means of reaching its preferred political and military ends.

The promise of the Arab Spring never came to fruition for the Yemeni people. The fragility of post-revolution states provides fertile ground for foreign interference. A power grab from factions within the country ensued backed by nations jostling for control over the region. Aid organizations such as the U.N. attempt to maintain non-partisan support of Yemen, but when the powerful interests fueling the civil war also fund the U.N., the situation reaches the impasse we see today. </p><p>As the war drags on, the likelihood of a peace agreement in the interest of Yemenis becomes an increasingly improbable event – by Cameron Joseph</p><p><span><a href="https://merionwest.com/2020/07/01/the-puppet-masters-of-yemens-humanitarian-crisis/">https://merionwest.com/2020/07/01/the-puppet-masters-of-yemens-humanitarian-crisis/</a></span></p><p><span> = <a href="https://mg.co.za/world/2020-07-12-the-orchestrators-of-the-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crisis-in-yemen/">https://mg.co.za/world/2020-07-12-the-orchestrators-of-the-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crisis-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen: Third-largest Yemeni city defaced after five years of war</strong></p><p>The city of Taiz, the third-largest in Yemen, was seen defaced after enduring more than five years of war, as seen on Monday. Drone footage captured buildings and houses destroyed by the strikes while ground footage unveils the condition local residents are living in. A man could be seen taking care of kids on the last floor of a shattered building, as people were walking among debris and getting potable water from a public water tank. "Due to the war, I left the house, I was afraid for my children. I had to leave the house, a shell fell onto my house and destroyed it all, now we don't have anything. Then, I fled to al-Hoban, I lived in a house, but I cannot pay the rent so I had to go back to al-Jahmaliya to my destroyed house to live there. I use some wood and plastic to cover the broken windows and doors," Shihab Abdullah, a local resident, said. Human rights activist Awad Almariry mentioned that on the eastern side of Taiz the destruction "makes you think it was a hurricane, not war." The activist added that the damage "spreads to public institutions such as hospitals and service institutions in general." Once known as the "cultural capital of Yemen," now Taiz is reportedly the longest-running battleground in the Yemeni war since Houthi forces took the city on March 22, 2015. According to reports, Taiz became the most heavily bombed city by the Saudi-led coalition airstrikes.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlobu8PEmEA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlobu8PEmEA</a></span> = <span><a href="https://ruptly.tv/en/videos/20200630-005--Yemen--Third-largest-Yemeni-city-defaced-after-five-years-of-war">https://ruptly.tv/en/videos/20200630-005--Yemen--Third-largest-Yemeni-city-defaced-after-five-years-of-war</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Menschenrechtler: Hunderte in Geheimgefängnissen im Jemen gefoltert</strong></p><p><span>Eine jemenitische Menschenrechtsgruppe hat beiden Konfliktparteien in dem Bürgerkriegsland auf der arabischen Halbinsel hundertfache Folter in Geheimgefängnissen und andere Übergriffe vorgeworfen.</span></p><p><span>Seit April 2016 seien 1.600 Fälle von willkürlichen Verhaftungen, 770 Fälle von Entführungen, 344 Fälle von Folter sowie 66 Todesfälle dokumentiert worden, heißt es <a href="https://mwatana.org/en/hundreds-at-unofficial-detention-centers/">in einem Report</a> der Mwatana-Organisation für Menschenrechte, der heute veröffentlicht wurde.

In a statement today announcing the release of its new report, “<span><a href="https://mwatana.org/en/in-the-darkness">In the Darkness</a></span>,” Mwatana confirmed that all parties to the conflict have detained hundreds of Yemenis at unofficial detention centers. Detainees have been disappeared, have been tortured, and have died in detention. Some of these acts may amount to war crimes. Mwatana reiterated its calls for the Ansar Allah group (Houthis), the government of Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, authorities loyal to the Islah Party in Marib and Taiz, and UAE forces and UAE-aligned armed groups, including the Southern Transitional Council, to immediately release all those arbitrary detained, to end the use of torture and to reveal the fate of those forcibly disappeared.</p><p>Today, Mwatana published a report entitled, “<span><a href="https://mwatana.org/en/in-the-darkness">In the Darkness</a></span>: Abusive Detention, Disappearance and Torture in Yemen’s Unofficial Prisons.” The report documents cases of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture between May 2016 and April 2020 by all parties to the conflict in Yemen. The report consists of two parts: The first part examines 11 unofficial detention centers where people were arbitrarily detained, tortured and, in some cases, died in detention. The second part highlights cases of enforced disappearance in areas under the control of the following three parties: The Ansar Allah group (Houthis), the government of Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, authorities loyal to the Islah Party in Marib and Taiz, and UAE forces and UAE-aligned armed groups, including the Southern Transitional Council.</p><p>Since 2016, Mwatana has documented 1605 incidents of arbitrary detention, 770 incidents of enforced disappearance and 344 incidents of torture, including 66 deaths in detention centers, across Yemen.</p><p><em>The warring parties continue to insult Yemenis’ dignity by committing such violations, including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture, Victims have been subjected to appalling patterns of torture. Urgent action is needed to release all those arbitrarily detained as one of the most crucial steps given the looming spread of Covid-19 in detention centers, and the danger the disease poses to detainees</em></p><p>The Ansar Allah group (Houthis) bears responsibility for 904 incidents of arbitrary or abusive detention, 353 incidents of enforced disappearance, and 138 incidents of torture, including 27 deaths in detention centers. The internationally recognized Yemeni government bears responsibility for 282 incidents of arbitrary or abusive detention, 90 incidents of enforced disappearance and 65 incidents of torture, including 14 deaths in detention centers. UAE forces and UAE-aligned armed groups, including the Southern Transitional Council, bear responsibility for 419 incidents of arbitrary or abusive detention, 327 incidents of enforced disappearance and 141 incidents of torture, including 25 deaths in detention centers.</p><p>All parties to the conflict in Yemen have used arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture against perceived opponents, and those they believe to be followers or supporters of their opponents. The warring parties have also used such violations against civilians in order to impose their authority in the areas under their control.</p><p>“The warring parties continue to insult Yemenis’ dignity by committing such violations, including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture,” Radhya Al-Mutawakel, Mwatana for Human Rights Chairperson said. “Victims have been subjected to appalling patterns of torture. Urgent action is needed to release all those arbitrarily detained as one of the most crucial steps given the looming spread of Covid-19 in detention centers, and the danger the disease poses to detainees.”</p><p>The report includes recommendations for the parties to the conflict and authorities in Yemen, as well as a number of countries and relevant actors such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, the United States and the Security Council. Among the most critical recommendations addressed to all parties to the conflict and authorities in Yemen is the urgent release of all those arbitrarily detained in light of the risks arising from the spread of Covid-19.</p><p>The report documents cases of arbitrary and abusive detention, including torture and cruel treatment during interrogation, in 11 unofficial detention centers run by various parties to the conflict across Yemen. These detention centers are located in the capital city of Sana’a, Aden, Taiz, Marib, Al-Hudaydah, Dhamar, Hadramout, Abyan and Ibb.</p><p>While conditions of detention across Yemen, including in official detention sites, are often appalling, access to unofficial detention sites for independent observers and family members of detainees is often limited to non-existent. Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment are particularly prevalent in these centers, and many of these sites are used to disappear people for lengthy periods.</p><p>The warring parties used different forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, including withholding food and water, sleep deprivation, electrocution, kicking, whipping, hitting with the butts of weapons, hitting with hammers, severe beatings, burning with cigarette butts, pulling out nails, forced drinking of urine and prolonged hanging from the ceiling. Some detainees were subjected to the burning of their genitals, sexual humiliation and threats of rape or rape of their relatives. Others said they were subjected to degrading treatment, such as being denied from performing religious services and forced nudity.</p><p>In addition to the appalling and degrading conditions of detention, and the detention of dozens in cramped facilities and narrow cells, coalition airstrikes have struck detention centers, at least four times, at detention centers in Dhamar, Al-Hudaydah and Sana’a.</p><p>The most recent attack occurred on the evening of Saturday, 31 August 2019, when the Saudi/UAE-led coalition bombed four buildings belonging to the Dhamar community college, where the Houthis had used at least one building as a detention site. The attack killed and injured about 170 civilians and prisoners protected under international humanitarian law. In a statement following the attack, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Yemen said it was aware of the site and had periodically visited it before the attack.</p><p>On 10 April 2020, authorities in Hadramout announced the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Yemen. While it is impossible to measure the true extent of the virus’s spread in Yemen, given the country’s extremely limited testing capacity, and warring parties’ refusal to provide transparent information about the disease, particularly Ansar Allah, social media pages have filled with condolences, and graveyards with bodies, as humanitarian organizations have noted the Covid-19 virus is spreading at the community level with grave consequence.</p><p>These steps are even more important given the generally poor conditions in detention centers across Yemen. In December 2019, Mwatana released <span><a href="https://mwatana.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B9-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86.pdf">a study on the situation of detention centers</a></span>, finding that detention centers are overcrowded, unsanitary, lacking adequate ventilation, toilets and shower facilities. Detainees are often unable to access materials such as soap. Routine health care is non-existent, and in some cases, detainees are denied access to healthcare all together.</p><p>In February, the ICRC and Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary General for Yemen <span><a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/parties-conflict-yemen-agree-complete-first-exchange-prisoners-and-detainees">announced </a></span> that a plan had been agreed on to complete the first large-scale formal exchange of prisoners and detainees since the beginning of the conflict. However, since the announcement, the plan has not been implemented. Still, several areas in Yemen have recently seen the release of arbitrarily detained persons by various warring parties. While these steps seem positive, they are not sufficient given the number of people arbitrarily detained and forcibly disappeared since the beginning of the conflict in Yemen when Ansar Allah and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh seized the capital city of Sana’a in September 2014, and after the conflict escalated with the Saudi/UAE-led coalition’s launch of military operations in March 2015 .</p><p>“The international community must support efforts to achieve accountability for these horrific violations. The mandate of the Group of Eminent Experts in Yemen must be renewed and strengthened to include collecting and preserving evidence of violations and related crimes,” Al-Mutawakel added. “The international community must be aware that accountability is one of the key factors needed to achieve sustainable peace in Yemen.”</p><p><span><a href="https://mwatana.org/en/hundreds-at-unofficial-detention-centers/">https://mwatana.org/en/hundreds-at-unofficial-detention-centers/</a></span></p><p>Executive summary: <span><a href="https://mwatana.org/en/in-the-darkness/">https://mwatana.org/en/in-the-darkness/</a></span></p><p>Full report: <span><a href="https://mwatana.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/In-the-Darkness.pdf">https://mwatana.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/In-the-Darkness.pdf</a></span></p><p>Media reports: <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/30/scale-of-torture-and-deaths-in-yemens-unofficial-prisons-revealed">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/30/scale-of-torture-and-deaths-in-yemens-unofficial-prisons-revealed</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://apnews.com/d5d219ae10249dd8d229283e03c788ae">https://apnews.com/d5d219ae10249dd8d229283e03c788ae</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-war-crimes-arbitrary-detention-muwatana-report">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-war-crimes-arbitrary-detention-muwatana-report</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-jails-torture-war-crimes-detention-centres-report-a9594196.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-jails-torture-war-crimes-detention-centres-report-a9594196.html</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/06/yemen-mwatana-torture-prisons-houthi-detention-abuse.html">https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/06/yemen-mwatana-torture-prisons-houthi-detention-abuse.html</a></span></p><p>Most important points. <span><a href="https://twitter.com/K_Beckerle/status/1277903948549173251">https://twitter.com/K_Beckerle/status/1277903948549173251</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Hot Issue – The Houthi Art of War: Why They Keep Winning in Yemen</strong></p><p>Introduction</p><p>The Houthis and their allies have withstood five years of aerial bombardment, blockades, and attacks on multiple fronts by forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Throughout the last five years, the Houthis have been outgunned, outspent, and subject to persistent aerial and satellite surveillance. Yet the intervention has not materially weakened them, and now, the Houthis are once again on the offensive across multiple fronts (<span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/03/yemen-saudi-arabia-jawf-maarib-houthis-war-borders-oil-gas.html">al-Monitor</a></span>, March 12).</p><p>The resiliency of the Houthis stems from their leadership’s understanding and consistent application of the algebra of insurgency. T.E. Lawrence used the term, or a version of it, in an article he wrote for <em>Army Quarterly</em> in 1920. The article, “Evolution of a Revolt,” argues that insurgents would be victorious if they applied certain “algebraical factors.” [2] These include force mobility and security as well as time and respect for the populace. [3] The Houthis broadly apply these and multiply them with superior human intelligence and an intimate knowledge of northwest Yemen’s daunting mountainous terrain. The Houthis, partly due to technical support from Iran, have also added drone and missile technology to the equation. These factors combine to make the Houthis a formidable force.</p><p>Move or Die</p><p>Force mobility has been—and remains—fundamental to the Houthis’ success in battling elements of the Saudi and Emirati militaries as well as those forces they support. These forces include Yemen’s internationally recognized government-in-exile, led by President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, which is allied with Saudi Arabia, and a panoply of militias and armed groups supported by the UAE. The Houthis understand and readily apply what Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley explained in 2016, “on the future battlefield, if you stay in one place longer than two or three hours, you will be dead.” [4] General Milley made his comments in light of the widespread use of drones and other rapidly developing battlefield technologies.</p><p>The UAE’s and Saudi Arabia’s ability to field unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased over the last three years. Both countries use Chinese manufactured UAVs in Yemen, most of which are operated by Chinese contractors as Riyadh and Abu Dhabi suffer from a lack of well-trained personnel. Saudi Arabia and the UAE also enjoy drone and satellite surveillance provided by the United States, which flies its own UAVs over Yemen on a daily basis.</p><p>In response to what, at times, has been persistent aerial surveillance, the Houthis make extensive use of highly mobile small combat units. These units are critical to the Houthis’ ability to defend territory, harass enemy forces, and plan and launch offensives. The combat units most often consist of no more than 20 men—roughly equivalent to a squad or specialized platoon—who rely on two or three light trucks and/or technicals. These trucks and/or technicals are easy to disguise and traverse Yemen’s worst roads and tracks.</p><p>Security and Intelligence</p><p>To a large degree, the mobility of Houthi forces ensures their security. The combat units that rove around their assigned sectors are indistinguishable from civilians since a significant percentage of Yemeni men in northwest Yemen carry weapons. Long before the start of the current war, bearing arms was a part of the culture. Additionally, the Toyota trucks used by the Houthis are as ubiquitous as the Kalashnikovs and G3 rifles carried by many across large swaths of Yemen.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The defeat of the Houthis has, according to many analysts and think tanks, been imminent for much of the past five years. The better equipped militaries of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and their various proxy forces were supposed to rapidly defeat the Houthis and their allies. Great emphasis was placed on the technical superiority of the Western-equipped militaries of Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Yet despite the expenditure of vast sums on weapons and materiel by Riyadh and the Abu Dhabi, the Houthis have consolidated their control of northwest Yemen and are poised to capture the governorate of Marib.</p><p>The Houthis’ ability to defy and defeat technologically superior forces is a reminder that, as the military strategist and fighter pilot Colonel John Boyd argued, “machines don’t fight wars, terrain doesn’t fight wars. Humans fight wars. You must get into the minds of humans. That’s where the battles are won.” [9] The Houthis excel on the battlefield and this is unlikely to change, no matter how much Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and their backers spend on the war in Yemen. However, despite their military success, the Houthis may lose the core battle for the hearts and minds of Yemenis. Ironically, it is the end or reduction of hostilities that will most weaken the Houthis’ hold on power.</p><p>The war and their martial abilities are the Houthis’ greatest sources of legitimacy and support. Many of those who back the Houthis do so only for pragmatic reasons. </p><p>While the Houthis will remain a martial and political force in northwest Yemen for the foreseeable future, resistance to the Houthi family itself will grow if the war winds down. Without the threat posed by the coalition and coalition-backed forces, the dominance of the Houthi family in the political arena of northwest Yemen will be more difficult to justify and sustain. Tensions within the core leadership will also threaten this dominance. The immediacy of war provides most of the cohesiveness that the Houthi leadership has enjoyed. Without the war, tensions within the core leadership will become more pronounced. As rival leaders attempt to broaden and reinforce power bases, there will be more space for old and emergent elites to reassert their authority. Over time this will lead to the dilution of the power held by the Houthis’ core leadership – by Michael Horton</p><p><span><a href="https://jamestown.org/program/hot-issue-the-houthi-art-of-war-why-they-keep-winning-in-yemen/">https://jamestown.org/program/hot-issue-the-houthi-art-of-war-why-they-keep-winning-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Seizing the State: Ibb’s Security Arrangement after Ansarallah’s Takeover</strong></p><p>Main Findings</p><p>Ansarallah’s takeover of Ibb governorate in 2014 usurped power from the local elite. While state institutions became stronger through Ansarallah’s focus on controlling formal structures and personnel, the members of the elite who had previously held the reins of power in Ibb became increasingly marginalized, a process that has been repeated in other governorates that have fallen under Ansarallah’s control.</p><p>Ibb’s social structure differs markedly from the northern regions where Ansarallah originated and remains firmly rooted, but Ibb has also hosted political networks connecting it to power centers in the north. These connections helped facilitate Ansarallah’s seizure of the governorate and the group’s consolidation of control over it. Prior to Ansarallah’s arrival, the elite in Ibb derived its power from a socioeconomic structure best characterized as feudalistic, with so-called sheikhs operating as landowners and with the farmers working the fields being paid in kind.</p><p>While in a tacit alliance of convenience with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who continued to hold sway over most state institutions even after resigning in 2012, Ansarallah installed its members in key positions within state institutions and appointed allies as supervisors, who were ordered to learn state administration from incumbent officials. These supervisors would eventually come to wield control, but they did not immediately displace their predecessors.</p><p>State institutions in Yemen, with their hierarchical nature and informal social extension in the form of aqils, community liaisons, are easier to control than sheikhs. To decrease the risk of sheikhs uniting against Ansarallah in Ibb, the group marginalized them while focusing on capturing state institutions, a fundamental element in the group’s larger political goal of being taken seriously as a state actor.</p><p>By 2017 in Ansarallah-controlled Ibb, the police had emerged as the first security provider approached by residents to deal with problems, followed by Ansarallah itself. Residents viewed the police positively, with 60 percent considering them “well respected” in the city of Ibb.</p><p>Ansarallah’s ongoing control of Ibb has stretched the police force beyond its capacity, with crucial work being ignored so its energies can be redirected toward the suppression of Ansarallah’s opponents.</p><p>Policemen and activists interviewed believe that aqils in Ibb no longer act independently in representing the interest of their communities, but instead implement whatever orders Ansarallah issues or risk detention. Meanwhile, the aqils view their relationship with Ansarallah as one of merely coordinating with the state.</p><p>From the Introduction:</p><p>As the conflict in Yemen drags on, developments in the governorate of Ibb have not received as much attention as those in the more politically important and strategically vital cities of Aden, alHodeida, Sanaa and Taiz. Ibb fell under the control of Ansarallah in October 2014, after the local ruling elite struck a deal with the armed group instead of organizing resistance to it. Since 2015 the Saudi-led coalition opposing Ansarallah’s power grab in the country has launched thousands of airstrikes against civilian and military infrastructure in Ibb, in central Yemen, as Ansarallah and local tribes opposing it engaged in intermittent armed conflict on the ground.4 Despite these and other security challenges, the governorate has remained a safe enough haven to attract internally displaced persons (IDPs), especially from neighboring Taiz and al-Hodeida.</p><p>The security arrangement in the governorate, however, changed as a consequence of Ansarallah taking control of Ibb. The local leaders who facilitated Ansarallah’s relatively peaceful takeover may have done so with the hope of preserving their positions of authority through a deal, but the arrangement shifted power such that the traditional informal security actors lost their standing as Ansarallah-captured state institutions gained influence. Today, the governor of Ibb, Abdulwahid Salah—affiliated with the General People’s Congress (GPC), the party of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh and Saleh’s successor, President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi—has been reduced to a cutout, an empty symbol of state authority who lacks control over the state institutions he supposedly oversees. To understand this outcome, it is important to consider Ansarallah’s alliances, strategies and interests.</p><p> – by Mareike Transfeld, Maysaa Shuja al-Deen, Raiman al-Hamdani</p><p><span><a href="http://www.yemenpolling.org/seizing-the-state-ibbs-security-arrangement-after-ansarallahs-takeover/">http://www.yemenpolling.org/seizing-the-state-ibbs-security-arrangement-after-ansarallahs-takeover/</a></span></p><p>full report: <span><a href="http://www.yemenpolling.org/Projects-en/ICSP_EU_IBBReport2020June30.pdf">http://www.yemenpolling.org/Projects-en/ICSP_EU_IBBReport2020June30.pdf</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>The UAE is gradually eclipsing Saudi Arabia in Yemen</strong></p><p>The STC's takeover of Socotra indicates that the United Arab Emirates has marginalised Saudi Arabia into a weaker position, at least for now</p><p>After much jostling with Saudi and local authorities, the United Arab Emirates-backed separatist takeover of Yemen's remote island of Socotra effectively secured one of Abu Dhabi's primary objectives in the country, as it seeks influence elsewhere in south Yemen.</p><p>Following a previous takeover attempt in May 2018, UAE-backed forces <span><a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2018/5/13/saudi-troops-arrive-on-yemens-socotra-after-uae-tensions">partially</a></span> withdrew after a Saudi-brokered deal.</p><p>This development symbolises the UAE's gradual eclipsing of Saudi Arabia as a dominant external actor in Yemen - previously a limited player in the country - while Riyadh slowly loses influence through its ideal candidate, the UN recognised government of Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi.</p><p>The UAE has long coveted the island as a platform to extend its maritime trade across the Indian Ocean and beyond, along with other ports in south Yemen including Aden and Mukalla.

Though it vocally opposed the <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/crisis-in-yemen-as-aden-separatists-declare-self-government">declaration</a></span>, it is not inconceivable that Abu Dhabi encouraged the STC's move, in order to legitimise its presence and undermine Hadi.</p><p>While both the UAE and Saudi Arabia have now clearly diverged in Yemen, their relationship should rather be considered as a "rivalry within a solid alliance".

Rarely are its policies studied through a more comprehensive survey of its activities in multiple countries in the ‘neighbourhood’ where it is most visibly engaged.</p><p>This paper, researched and written as part of a Chatham House project to address this gap in analysis of the UAE’s foreign and national security policy, sheds light on Abu Dhabi’s ambitions to play a key role in shaping political and governance structures across the region in line with its own model, and in securing trade routes in its wider neighbourhood as an economic hub linking East Africa and South Asia.</p><p>The ‘UAE model’ integrates economic openness, strong governance and service delivery, and a relatively secular and liberal (for the region) social environment, combined with a closed political system that polices speech and is built around an entrenched security state.

However, Abu Dhabi has been far more assertive against the Brotherhood and its purported backers, and much more cautious in its approach to Iran.</p><p>Abu Dhabi, the biggest and wealthiest of the seven emirates, increasingly sets the direction of travel for the UAE at home and abroad. The evolution of the ‘UAE model’ is chiefly associated with Abu Dhabi’s crown prince and de facto leader, Mohammed bin Zayed – or MbZ.</p><p>While MbZ and his trusted inner circle share a worldview, they are not necessarily operating from a strategic masterplan. A very small group often makes policy choices that are tactical and reactive, and such ad hoc decision-making can lead to overcorrection and missed opportunities.</p><p>Western policymakers tend to be dazzled by the UAE’s perceived liberalism, and by its officials’ ability to literally and figuratively speak their language. They need to better acquaint themselves with the ‘UAE model’ in all its aspects, and get to grips with the reality that Abu Dhabi expects to be treated as an equal. Dealing with the UAE as a robust and mature partner will also mean demonstrating a greater willingness to push back.</p><p><span>From Introduction</span></p><p>For much of its first few decades as a nation state, the UAE operated a conservative foreign and national security policy that was largely predicated on ensuring survival in the face of internal and external threats to the fragile unity and territorial integrity of the federation. While internal threats have faded, perceived existential vulnerability to regional currents continues to drive policy. Perhaps the most important difference between the federation’s approach to external affairs in its early years and its current posture is a clear sense of self-assurance and ambition among a new generation of leaders – and a growing perception among this group that the UAE is being left to fend for itself in a deeply turbulent region. The crown prince and de facto ruler of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan – or MbZ – and a trusted inner circle of advisers, many of them his full brothers, have consolidated power internally, and built a strong security and military apparatus capable of warding off most (although not all) internal and external threats, and have since 2011 operated an increasingly activist foreign and national security policy abroad. Whereas his father, Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, aspired to build a model of Arab statehood in the UAE, many observers believe MbZ wants to export his own model.</p><p>In 2017 researchers at Chatham House undertook a project to examine the UAE’s foreign and national security policy, including through interviews with UAE officials, regional and Western policymakers, and others. The research, which was completed in late 2019, sheds light on Emirati ambitions to play a key role in shaping regional political and governance structures, under the umbrella of regional Saudi–Emirati (and, to an extent, Egyptian) leadership, with the UAE at times fashioning itself as the ‘intellectual architect’, as one interviewee put it, of a new model for country-level and regional security built around the federation’s own internal structures. This ‘UAE model’ integrates economic openness, strong governance and service delivery, and a relatively secular and liberal (for the region) social environment, combined with a closed political system that polices speech and is built around an entrenched security state; and, just as important, a rejection of any political or religious ideology that might challenge the supremacy of the state and its leaders.</p><p>The UAE has been much more visibly activist in its foreign policy across a MENA region embroiled in deepening turmoil since the Arab uprisings of 2011, during which period the US has been perceived by the UAE and Saudi Arabia to be retrenching from its past role as regional security guarantor. In this context, Emirati officials say they can no longer assume that the federation will be able to sustain its past trajectory towards becoming a rare locus of stability while operating a non-interventionist foreign policy. After years of mounting regional disorder and failed Western intervention in the Middle East, epitomized by the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the model offered by the modernizing leadership in Abu Dhabi is an attractive one to Western policymakers who have long hoped for regional powers to play a more assertive role in stabilization and securitization in their neighbourhood. Diplomats, policymakers and politicians are also encouraged by time spent with Emirati counterparts who – literally and figuratively – speak their language, and in the safe, orderly and cosmopolitan metropolises of Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p><p>A principal driving force in the UAE leadership’s approach to the region is as much what it stands against as what it stands for. MbZ and his inner circle perceive that transnational, political Islamist ideologies promoted by Iran and the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood and its boosters, including but not limited to Qatar and Turkey, pose an existential threat to the stability of so-called ‘status quo’ powers in the region, and act as a driver of regional radicalism. As one interviewee for this paper described it, the UAE’s overriding threat perception can be summarized as ‘Iran and the Ikhwan</p><p>Yet as this paper demonstrates, Abu Dhabi is aggressive in its attempts to uproot the Brotherhood but more cautious in its efforts to counter Iranian influence and expansionism, largely through support for coercive sanctions of the kind pursued by the Trump administration – by Peter Salisbury</p><p><span><a href="https://reader.chathamhouse.org/risk-in-uae-salisbury">https://reader.chathamhouse.org/risk-in-uae-salisbury</a></span></p><p><span>and full paper. <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2020-07-01-risk-in-uae-salisbury.pdf">https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2020-07-01-risk-in-uae-salisbury.pdf</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Israel’s ambitions in south Yemen increase risk of conflict with Houthis</strong></p><p>Israel’s involvement in the Yemen war throughout its five year duration is an open secret. In 2015, when the Saudi Arabian Embassy in the capital Sanaa was seized by the Houthi forces in retaliation for the Saudi-led coalition’s aggression, a large cache of <span><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/263649-israel-weapons-sanaa-saudi/">Israeli-made</a></span> weapons and ammunition was discovered, in addition to documents detailing intentions by the US to establish a military base on Perim Island near the Bab Al-Mandab Strait, “to protect [America’s] interests and ensure the security of Israel”. The island has been under the coalition’s control since it was wrested from the Houthis in the same year. Foreign mercenaries fighting on behalf of coalition-partner the UAE were also said to have been <span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/israel-training-yemen-mercenaries/249637/">trained</a></span> by the Israeli military at camps in the Negev Desert.</p><p>Amid the ever-growing normalisation of relations between Israel and Gulf states, it should come as no surprise that it was reported last week that Israel and the Emirati-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) are “<span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200622-uae-backed-stc-in-yemen-secret-friends-with-israel/">secret friends</a></span>” with meetings facilitated by the UAE.</p><p>The STC’s vice-chairman, Hani Bin Briek, confirmed that relations with Israel are “very good” while Tel Aviv reacted positively to the prospects of a “new autonomous state in Yemen”. The fragmentation of Arab states is, of course, consistent with Zionist strategies in the region; support for separatism in the south of Yemen echoes Israel’s decades-old policy of backing <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20191021-the-kurds-may-well-have-no-friends-but-the-mountains-but-they-do-have-israel/">Kurdish statehood</a></span>.</p><p>Covert Israeli interventions in Yemen are not without precedent.</p><p>As with <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200619-after-libya-will-turkey-defeat-the-uae-in-yemen/">every other</a></span> party involved in the current conflict in Yemen, access to all seaways leading to the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean play a significant part in the underlying agendas. It is certainly one of the charges levied against the UAE over its involvement in the recent STC “coup” of <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200621-uae-backed-militias-stage-coup-in-yemens-socotra/">Socotra Island</a></span>.</p><p>However, the revelation of Israeli support for the STC is a worrying development for the prospects of maintaining a unified Yemen, however elusive that appears to be. Any attempts by Tel Aviv to back the emergence of a break-away “independent” state in the region should be treated with suspicion.</p><p>Moreover, the Houthis, who are <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20191108-riyadh-delays-the-inevitable-the-houthis-have-the-power-in-yemen-hadi-has-no-authority/">supported</a></span> by most of the Yemeni armed forces, have threatened Israel once before with “revenge” over its known involvement in the Yemen war of aggression.</p><p>These are security challenges that Israel takes seriously, especially with the long-range ballistic missiles and armed drones in the Yemeni army’s arsenal, which cross-border offensives against Saudi have shown to be very accurate.

The Houthis’ opponents ― Yemen’s internationally recognized government, along with Saudi Arabia and the U.S. ― are failing to provide the level of needed aid or to halt bombings and a blockade of Houthi-controlled areas, causing inflation and mass hunger that makes many Yemenis especially vulnerable to COVID-19.</p><p>Both sides of the conflict are ignoring pleas for a ceasefire</p><p>The WHO predicts a coronavirus death toll of at least 65,000 in Yemen unless officials change course.</p><p>Just as powerful Yemenis and international players previously decided to turn Yemen into a battleground, they now seem committed to letting thousands of Yemeni families suffer ― showing that even a shared global challenge like a pandemic can’t end the country’s treatment as a global punching bag.</p><p>The Houthis are scrambling to ensure the coronavirus outbreak does not threaten their rule or weaken their ability to withstand the U.S.’s partners in Yemen.

Some of the 59 isolation units established by the WHO are admitting more people than they can safely handle and running low on personal protective equipment, Mohammed told HuffPost.</p><p>Authorities turned the first quarantine facilities for people entering Yemen from abroad into a “breeding ground” for the virus with policies like putting more than six people in each room, Jumaan of the Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation said. Those detainees, many of them infected, were not stopped from leaving for activities like shopping, which is how some began to buy medicine from a relative of Jumaan’s who is a pharmacist in the area. He soon infected his entire household, including his elderly parents.</p><p>Medical “facilities are already overwhelmed,” Tamuna Sabadze of the International Rescue Committee, which operates an isolation facility and a network of clinics in southern Yemen, wrote in an email. </p><p>“Suspected COVID-19 patients are being turned away … while people with other illnesses are being turned away from clinics which have been designated COVID-19 only,” Sabadze continued. “Doctors and nurses do not have sufficient PPE to continue treating the increase in patients with COVID-19 symptoms, and the severe lack of testing means COVID-19 is spreading undetected.”</p><p>Even when infected Yemenis do receive clinical attention, their chances of survival are often low after years of living in increasingly desperate conditions.

The Venezuelan representative observed that the non-permanent members of the Council were sidelined from all substantive discussions, but nonetheless voted in favour of the resolution.</p><p>In effect, the sanctions and embargo have imposed a total blockade against at least a third of the people of Yemen, a brutal and hypocritical collective punishment for rejecting the dictates of the GCC and ‘the international community’. The rest of Yemen, occupied and under the control of either Saudi or UAE military forces and their ‘local partners’.</p><p><span><a href="https://southfront.org/saudi-led-blockade-of-yemen-how-did-it-all-start-will-it-ever-end/">https://southfront.org/saudi-led-blockade-of-yemen-how-did-it-all-start-will-it-ever-end/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p><span>Yemen’s Catastrophe and Saudi’s Fiasco</span></p><p>Weak from five years of invasion and siege, the Yemeni people are struggling against the corona pandemic. Despite the UN call for a ceasefire, and despite the Saudi regime announcing a ceasefire, there has been no peace for Yemen. A country acknowledged to have the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today is facing further catastrophes.</p><p>The invading powers, led by Saudi Arabia, and supported by the US, British and French governments, are cutting up the country to their own ends. Different plans are being fought out within a single coalition, using heavy weapons and coups. It is hard to distinguish that which is more complete – Yemen’s tragedy or Saudi Arabia’s fiasco.</p><p>Blocking and Skimping Aid</p><p>Despite the extensive suffering of the Yemeni people, the Saudi regime is currently preventing ships from unloading in Hodeida port. Yahyah Sharafaddin, vice chair Red Sea Ports Corporation, reports that the last ship to unload in the port was on May 20<sup>th</sup>. The Saudis are holding up 22 ships wanting to dock. This is despite the fact that these ships have received permission to do so from the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism for Yemen (UNVIM). UNVIM was set up in 2015, it is based in Djibouti, and is responsible for preventing arms smuggling.</p><p>These ships contain no arms. They do contain gasoline, diesel, food and medical supplies. The impact of their denial of entry is substantial.</p><p>In an effort to offset, or justify, their blockade the Saudi regime say they are arranging for 800,000 litres of fuel to be trucked from Aden daily. But this is compared to a daily requirement in the affected areas of 10.2 million litres.</p><p>Yet the Saudi regime boasts of its aid to Yemen. In this it is not alone. The “international community” aid to Yemen is bound up with political manipulation and miserly commitment.</p><p>Covid 19 in the Arabian Peninsula</p><p>Despite being under siege Yemen did not benefit from isolation. Corona found its way through Yemen’s interconnectedness with neighbours.</p><p>There is no doubt that migrant workers in the GCC countries are disproportionately suffering from the outbreak. Many have been trapped in crowded hostels. Others will have taken the disease to their home country. It is estimated that 3.5 million migrants in the GCC countries will lose employment (and residence) as a result of Covid 19.</p><p>For Yemen this will be a further blow. Remittances home from Yemenis abroad have been an important part of Yemen’s economy, assisting in family welfare and wider social development. Yemeni migrants, working mostly in Saudi Arabia and UAE, contribute around $3.7 billion annually to the Yemeni economy. That represents 12% of Yemen’s GDP</p><p>The First Saudi Fiasco – Fake Cease Fire</p><p>At the start of April the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, called for a cessation of military conflicts in the time of the pandemic. With much international boosting, the Saudi regime announced a two week ceasefire on April 8<sup>th</sup>, followed by a month ceasefire at the end of that fortnight. Yet it continued to wage war throughout that period. According to figures from “Yemen Data Project”, in the months from February, through May this year, the Saudis launched more air strikes each month than in any month in the whole of 2019. They called a ceasefire and increased their bombing.</p><p>Violations are persistent still. According to the Saba News Agency, there were 45 air raids across five provinces in the 24 hours on June 26<sup>th</sup>.</p><p>The Second Saudi Fiasco – Coalition at War with Itself</p><p>A Piece of the Pie</p><p>The whole war was commenced in March 2015 by the coalition with the express aim of restoring the “internationally recognised government” of Hadi. Five years later, this leader is still unable to live in Yemen. Despite the useless slaughter, the Saudis and the UAE are neither of one accord, nor remotely concerned about the supposed war aim. They are, of one accord on seeking benefit in the war.</p><p>Time Running out for the Saudi Adventure</p><p>The Saudi regime appears to want an end to the war but is unwilling to concede its failure. Any popular movement in the Kingdom to achieve accountability from the regime faces terrifying obstacles. Its international allies, especially the US and British governments, continue to enable the war to be waged. So there is little pressure for an abrupt end. But the Saudi regime has neither limitless, time nor resources - by Steve Bell, Stop the War Coalition</p><p><a href="http://www.stopwar.org.uk/index.php/news-comment/3724-yemen-s-catastrophe-and-the-saudi-s-fiasco">http://www.stopwar.org.uk/index.php/news-comment/3724-yemen-s-catastrophe-and-the-saudi-s-fiasco</a> = <a href="https://labouroutlook.org/2020/07/03/yemens-catastrophe-the-saudis-fiasco-steve-bell-stop-the-war-coalition/">https://labouroutlook.org/2020/07/03/yemens-catastrophe-the-saudis-fiasco-steve-bell-stop-the-war-coalition/</a> <span>= </span><span><a href="https://nthnews.net/en/yemennews/yemens-catastrophe-and-saudis-fiasco">https://nthnews.net/en/yemennews/yemens-catastrophe-and-saudis-fiasco</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>Mhmd AlHouthi: "Brian Hook announced support&amp;assistance2 </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Saudi?src=hashtag_click">#Saudi</a></span><span> What is happenin now is a result of </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/US?src=hashtag_click">#US</a></span><span> decision rejectin peace,participatory&amp;supportive of continuation of aggression Were USA pilots,experts&amp;soldiers sent2 </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KSA?src=hashtag_click">#KSA</a></span><span>?We hold US&amp;Coalition responsible4disturbing serenity"</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/HussainBukhaiti/status/1278449423794819072">https://twitter.com/HussainBukhaiti/status/1278449423794819072</a></span></p><p><span>(?

The FSO Safer, a 45-year-old supertanker loaded with more than 1 million barrels of crude oil has been caught between the warring sides and left to decay.</p><p>Activists and officials warn that the Safer could hemorrhage its cargo into the sea at any time, with devastating consequences for nature and the already-beleaguered people of Yemen.</p><p>Yemen's government says the Safer is in "bad and deteriorating" condition. The single-hulled vessel was part of Yemen's national oil infrastructure before the war started.</p><p>An "imminent" catastrophe</p><p>Last week, The Associated Press quoted an official with Yemen's state-run oil company as saying seawater had entered the engine room, forcing the shutdown of engines used, among other things, to keep inert gas pumping through the empty space in the oil storage tanks. That gas maintains pressure in the tanks to prevent the build-up of oxygen or other potentially flammable gases. The fact that inert gas is no longer being pumped into the tanks creates a serious risk of explosion.</p><p>Photos posted online by the Yemeni environmental campaign group Holm Akhdar (Green Dream) show various parts of the vessel severely corroded, which could lead to significant leaks even without an explosion.</p><p>"The hull of the vessel has been deteriorating and one of its pipes has been punctured," the group's founder Mohammed al-Hokaimi told CBS News. He warned of an "increased risk of crude oil spilling from storage tanks while parties to the conflict continue to show indifference to this serious issue."</p><p>The Yemeni government has said that if the tanker ruptures, it could create an oil spill four times larger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster. In a letter to the United Nations, the government said the vessel posed an "imminent environmental and humanitarian catastrophe in the Red Sea."</p><p>Along with the Rea Sea environment, the tanker's valuable cargo is also at stake. The U.N. and the Yemeni government want access to the vessel, while the cash-strapped Houthi rebels want guarantees they'll be able to control the revenue from the sale of the oil, estimated at $45 million.</p><p>Just like in the wider war, the two sides accuse each other of refusing to make any concessions to avert disaster. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fso-safer-tanker-yemen-supertanker-full-of-crude-oil-decaying-civil-war-could-blow-up/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fso-safer-tanker-yemen-supertanker-full-of-crude-oil-decaying-civil-war-could-blow-up/</a></span></p><p><span>and another, US-centered and propaganda-biased thread on SAFER: </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/irinatsukerman/status/1278367629934309384">https://twitter.com/irinatsukerman/status/1278367629934309384</a></span></p><p>(* A K P)</p><p>Arab Coalition, US Envoy Brian Hook reveal Iranian weapons used against Saudi Arabia</p><p>New Iranian missiles and weapons found in Yemen were revealed by the Arab Coalition in a press conference on Monday.</p><p>US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook and Saudi Arabia's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir hosted a joint press conference after examining the weapons.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is consulting with all the countries on the UN Security Council on the dangers of not extending the arms embargo on Iran, says the Kingdom's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubair.</p><p>“The weapons that we see here today … are all the evidence we need, that the arms embargo on Iran must not be lifted.

UNDP recently launched two major initiatives that will impact Yemeni’s lives: a livelihood-support campaign and a five-governorate community awareness raising campaign around COVID-19 prevention measures.</p><p>COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on Yemen – a country that is already suffering from the world’s worst humanitarian and development crisis – by forcing thousands of micro, small and medium business to shutter, leaving many with nothing. However, through quick UNDP action and assessment of COVID-19’s potential social and economic impact in Yemen, the organization is helping thousands of Yemenis continue to operate their businesses and earn an income during this critical time. Grants provided by UNDP will help minimize the long-term social and economic impact for both business owners and communities of having businesses shutter. The funds will help the businesses stay open and, to ensure their safety during operation, UNDP is also providing emergency kits containing supplies to help fight COVID-19.</p><p>The continued operations of thousands of businesses will help ensure many – particularly the already vulnerable populations – will be able to care for their families. The income will allow them to purchase critical necessities like food, water, shelter, and medicines, possibly helping stave off COVID-19 and other rampant communicable diseases. For a country already facing the world’s worst humanitarian and development crisis, this support is critical.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.ye.undp.org/content/yemen/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2020/supporting-vital-livelihoods-and-increasing-covid-19-prevention-.html">https://www.ye.undp.org/content/yemen/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2020/supporting-vital-livelihoods-and-increasing-covid-19-prevention-.html</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span>Hassan El-Tayyab Joins BBC to Discuss the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen</p><p>Hassan El-Tayyab, FCNL's lead lobbyist on Middle East policy, joined BBC World on June 26 to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. 80 percent of the population is in need of humanitarian aid, and the pandemic will only deepen the suffering.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw0lPwetahM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw0lPwetahM</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Covid-19 als weitere Herausforderung für den Jemen</span></p><p><span>Der Jemen braucht dringend humanitäre Hilfe, Medikamente, neue Infrastrukturen und auch sonst alles, was zu einem Leben in Frieden gehört.

The ill-equipped medical center services more than 50,000 displaced people in the district.</p><p>Four years ago, when fighting between Yemen’s Houthi rebels and government forces, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, escalated, Nasser left his home village near the coastal city of Midi, also in Hajjah province, on the border with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Since then, he has been unemployed and depends on aid to feed his family, which became part of more than 3 million people displaced by the war, many pushed to the brink of famine amid stalemated fighting and a coronavirus pandemic that is ripping through the country.</p><p>“I am a poor person, and my son is in this state,” said Nasser. “And they tell me he is malnourished, you can see how his condition is.”</p><p>The health care center found out about the infant recently through a local charity which provides aid to displaced in the area, said Dr. Ali Hajar, who oversees the malnutrition clinic at the center.</p><p>“His condition is very, very tragic. He suffers from acute malnutrition. His skin is stretching tightly over his bones,” the physician said.</p><p><span>The situation in Yemen is only expected to get worse as donor countries recently cut back on aid amid the coronavirus pandemic and also due to concerns that the aid might not be reaching its intended recipients in territories controlled by the Houthis.</span></p><p><span>Some 24 million Yemeni people, which is 80% of the country’s entire population, require some form of assistance or protection</span></p><p><span><a href="https://apnews.com/9bd6a6ea032c9cbdc025354290a957cc">https://apnews.com/9bd6a6ea032c9cbdc025354290a957cc</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/6/29/hunger-stalks-children-in-yemen-amid-un-aid-cuts">https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/6/29/hunger-stalks-children-in-yemen-amid-un-aid-cuts</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Yemen UNHCR Sub-Office Aden fact sheet</p><p><span><a href="https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/77401">https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/77401</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp4 Flüchtlinge / Refugees</span></h2><p><span>(B H K pS)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span>The young Adel, victim of a Houthi bullet, lost him the ability to work</p><p>The young Adel Othman Ahmed Salem twenty years old after he strengthened his arms and extended his mustache and was hoping that his parents and his family would support him in providing the requirements of life, it became a burden on them as a result of Houthi gunshots that penetrated his body and kept him bedridden and lost his strength like his young readers.

The Houthis have referred to Sunni Muslim opposition groups as takfiri (those who declare other Muslims apostates) and accuse Sunni Muslims who do not align with the movement as collaborators with or spies for the Saudi-led coalition. The Houthis have also tried to pressure Sunni Muslim imams to deliver prescribed sermons at mosques in Houthi-controlled areas.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2020%20Yemen%20Country%20Update.pdf">https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2020%20Yemen%20Country%20Update.pdf</a></span></p><p>My comment: The Houthis’ oppression of other religions is obvious.
