The Obama administration initially backed the Saudis too, but later regretted it as thousands died.</p><p>Weapons supplied by American companies, approved by American officials, allowed Saudi Arabia to pursue the reckless campaign. But in June 2017, an influential Republican senator decided to cut them off, by withholding approval for new sales. It was a moment that might have stopped the slaughter.</p><p>Not under President Trump.</p><p>With billions at stake, one of the president’s favored aides, the combative trade adviser Peter Navarro, made it his mission to reverse the senator. Mr. Navarro, after consulting with American arms makers, wrote a memo to Jared Kushner and other top White House officials calling for an intervention, possibly by Mr. Trump himself. He titled it “Trump Mideast arms sales deal in extreme jeopardy, job losses imminent.”</p><p>Within weeks, the Saudis were once again free to buy American weapons.</p><p>The intervention, which has not been previously reported, underscores a fundamental change in American foreign policy under Mr. Trump that often elevates economic considerations over other ones. Where foreign arms sales in the past were mostly offered and withheld to achieve diplomatic goals, the Trump administration pursues them mainly for the profits they generate and the jobs they create, with little regard for how the weapons are used.</p><p>Mr. Trump has tapped Mr. Navarro, a California economist best known for polemics against China, to be a conduit between the Oval Office and defense firms. His administration <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/us/politics/trump-drones-sales.html">has also rewritten the rules</a></span> for arms exports, speeding weapon sales to foreign militaries. The State Department, responsible for licensing arms deals, now is charged with more aggressively promoting them.</p><p>“This White House has been more open to defense industry executives than any other in living memory,” said Loren B. Thompson, a longtime analyst who consults for major arms manufacturers.</p><p>American arms makers who sell to the Saudis say they are accountable to shareholders and are doing nothing wrong. And because weapon sales to foreign militaries must be approved by the State Department, the companies say they don’t make policy, only follow it.</p><p>But as the situation in Yemen worsened, at least one firm, Raytheon Company, did more than wait for decisions by American officials. It went to great lengths to influence them, even after members of Congress tried to upend sales to Saudi Arabia on humanitarian grounds.</p><p>Raytheon, a major supplier of weapons to the Saudis, including some implicated by human rights groups in the deaths of Yemeni civilians, has long viewed the kingdom as one of its most important foreign customers.</p><p>Intent on pushing the deals through, Raytheon followed the industry playbook: It took advantage of federal loopholes by sending former State Department officials, who were not required to be registered as lobbyists, to press their former colleagues to approve the sales.</p><p>And though the company was already embedded in Washington — its chief lobbyist, Mark Esper, would become Army secretary and then defense secretary under Mr. Trump — Raytheon executives sought even closer ties.</p><p>They assiduously courted Mr. Navarro, who intervened with White House officials on Raytheon’s behalf and successfully pressured the State Department, <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/magazine/rex-tillerson-and-the-unraveling-of-the-state-department.html">diminished under Mr. Trump</a></span>, to process the most contentious deals.</p><p>They also enlisted the help of David J. Urban, a lobbyist whose close ties to Mr. Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo go back to the 1980s, when all three men were at West Point.</p><p>The Trump administration has defended arms sales to Saudi Arabia as being vital to job growth and the American economy.</p><p>Records show that foreign military sales, facilitated by the U.S. government, rose sharply after Mr. Trump became president. They averaged about $51 billion a year during Mr. Trump’s first three years, compared with $36 billion a year during the final term of Mr. Obama, who also oversaw a big increase.</p><p>Arms industry groups say defense jobs rose more than 3.5 percent to about 880,000 during Mr. Trump’s first two years, though the numbers, the most recent available, do not specify how many were in manufacturing.</p><p>A State Department spokeswoman said that the administration had made clear that “economic security is national security,” and that the administration was “strengthening our advocacy for defense sales that are in our national interest.” She disputed the suggestion that human rights had taken a back seat to other considerations, insisting the new approach “actually increases focus on human rights” through military training and other programs with allies.</p><p>Getting the President’s Ear</p><p>Mr. Trump won the presidency partly on promises to resuscitate American manufacturing.</p><p>“We’re going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you,” he told a packed arena in Raleigh, N.C., on Nov. 7, 2016, the day before the election. </p><p>The defense firms presented themselves as the rare high-tech industry that had not recently lost ground to China, Mr. Thompson said.</p><p>During the first years of Mr. Trump’s presidency, as aides undermined one another and turned over on a regular basis, Mr. Navarro’s claim to an essential mission, and his new ties to arms executives, insulated him from the turbulence, according to the former administration officials.</p><p>In Mr. Navarro, they said, the companies had an advocate who was not shy about confronting senior leaders over matters he deemed important. And while the officials often bristled at his presumption, and worked to marginalize him, Mr. Navarro nevertheless retained influence with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Trump.</p><p>A $5 Billion Turnaround</p><p>As war broke out five years ago in Yemen, Raytheon was a company on the rebound.</p><p>Based in Waltham, Mass., it had risen over the years to become the third-largest defense firm in the United States, bolstered by sales of its best-known system, the Patriot missile. </p><p>Raytheon earned more of its revenue from sales to foreign governments than Lockheed Martin and other American defense giants, and few foreign customers were more important than Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Trouble for the company started on Oct. 8, 2016, when Saudi coalition planes repeatedly targeted a funeral hall in Sana</p><p>The firm would have to wait until Mr. Obama left office — and then try to forge ties with the Trump administration as quickly as possible.</p><p>The company’s executives got to work.</p><p>The firm would have to wait until Mr. Obama left office — and then try to forge ties with the Trump administration as quickly as possible.</p><p>The company’s executives got to work.</p><p>During the early months of the new presidency, Raytheon executives tried to get close to the administration by arranging for Mr. Kennedy to meet with Mr. Trump on a handful of occasions, including during the president’s trip to Saudi Arabia that May, former employees said.</p><p>Soon after the trip, the Trump administration waved through the delivery of bomb parts to the Saudis that Mr. Obama had delayed. But the company wanted more.</p><p>So it turned to Mr. Navarro, whose office helped Raytheon orchestrate Mr. Kennedy’s appearance at the August signing ceremony, according to a person with direct knowledge of the arrangement.</p><p>It was a face-saving moment for the president, and a turning point in the company’s relationship with the White House. In the months that followed, Mr. Navarro pushed hard for Raytheon and its deals with Saudi Arabia – By <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-laforgia">Michael LaForgia</a></span> and <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/walt-bogdanich">Walt Bogdanich</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/us/arms-deals-raytheon-yemen.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/us/arms-deals-raytheon-yemen.html</a></span></p><p><span>Comment: “</span>The Obama administration initially backed the Saudis too, but later regretted it as thousands died.”: This line is absolutely not true. Obama consistently backed the Saudi war on Yemen throughout his tenure, and while some in the admin have handwrung post-presidency to protect their liberal brand, Obama himself has never said he "regretted it."

He apparently was instrumental in convincing the president to put the profits of munition makers before the lives of Yemenis.</p><p>Consider the tragedy that had befallen Yemen, a deeply divided and tragically impoverished nation. </p><p>MbS, as the reckless, impulsive, dictatorial crown prince is known, wanted a toady in power next door. He also desired to demonstrate that he was the Big Man in the Middle East. So he and his counterpart in the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Zayed, created a faux coalition filled with the bought and conscripted and invaded Yemen. The conquest was supposed to be completed in a few weeks.</p><p>It soon became evident that the Saudi military is a vanity force, largely for show. Even with abundant American assistance, providing planes and munitions, training personnel, refueling planes, and giving intelligence to assist in targeting, Riyadh found itself stuck in what became an endless war, a quagmire that revealed the Saudi royals to be incompetent, unimaginative fools.</p><p>However, they proved to be efficient killers – of civilians. </p><p>Notably, President Barack Obama and the supposedly liberal interventionists who surrounded him, who insisted that something must be done to stop the killing in Syria, didn’t care and didn’t act. Nothing changed with President Trump; if anything, he seemed bewitched when he returned from his May 2017 trip. The slaughter continued.</p><p>The moral equities are clear if complex. The Yemenis, in this case the onetime insurgent, now ruling, faction, dominated by the Houthi movement, is no friend of humanity or liberty. The insurgents met plenty of internal opposition; Yemen never has really enjoyed internal peace.</p><p>However, the Saudis are worse – a ruthless, totalitarian regime that has grown more repressive under MbS, the internationally acclaimed social reformer.</p><p>Moreover, consider what the Saudi-Emirati "coalition," which included brutal Sudanese militias and more, has wrought. The Yemenis, meaning Houthis, are brutal, shelling indiscriminately, for instance. However, the bulk of the casualties and damage are caused by air attacks. And only one side has an air force.</p><p>Tipping the moral scale decisively is the fact that the Saudis and Emiratis had no moral cause to intervene. The Houthis did nothing against Riyadh or Abu Dhabi, other than toss out the ruler they believed would be most pliable. The attack on Yemen was wanton aggression for the most selfish reasons.</p><p>And Yemen has nothing to do with US security. The land, which began as and may return to two states, has spent years suffering through war, outside intervention, civil war, internal unrest, terrorism, political discontent, and more</p><p>In this circumstance one might expect Washington to bomb Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Instead, US officials embraced the aggressors. Apparently Obama saw US support as necessary to pacify the al-Saud clan, given the royals’ opposition to his nuclear negotiations and agreement with Iran.</p><p>Having abandoned the nuclear deal and otherwise spent most of his presidency genuflecting towards Riyadh – until he was worried about the collapse of the domestic shale oil industry – Trump obviously had a different reason for backing Saudi aggression. Rather, his administration tends to cite Iran’s support for Yemen. </p><p>Tehran’s intervention is a consequence, not cause, of the conflict. Regional specialists long have affirmed that the Houthis, a different variety of Shiite, are not puppets of Tehran. It was Saudi Arabia, which long meddled in Yemeni affairs, that made the conflict sectarian. Riyadh’s victims had to look somewhere for aid, and the foolish war gave Iran an opportunity to bleed the royals, costing MbS money and reputation</p><p>The only sensible US position was to stay out.</p><p>It would be bad enough for Washington to become an accomplice to murder in order to advance genuine security interests.</p><p>Why did that not happen with the new president, who had previously criticized the Saudi royals for relying on Washington? Ask Peter Navarro..</p><p>When US arms sales to Riyadh appeared in doubt, he swung into action.</p><p>Let there be no doubt. Navarro’s advice was deadly. Not to Americans. But to a far more vulnerable people half the world away.</p><p>Ironically, the administration may find that it has sold thousands of foreign lives for less than he expected. The collapse of oil prices has had several beneficial impacts, most notably shrinking monarchy’s revenues, wrecking MbS’s grand investment plans, forcing reliance on the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, and making the Yemeni war an even poorer investment. Soon there might not be a lot of money left over for more bombs.</p><p>The president’s decision to let Saudi Arabia drive America’s Mideast policy has had disastrous effects. The administration sent US personnel to the kingdom, allowing the royals to treat American soldiers as mercenaries, hired to guard the monarchy just as the royals buy people to perform every other tough or dirty job. Worse, the president, following Navarro’s advice, put greater value on a few jobs in America than tens of thousands of lives in Yemen.

Among the more than 800 total deaths recorded by the Civil Status Department in Aden between the beginning of May and Saturday, dozens of the deceased are prominent doctors, university professors, and senior government officials.</p><p>The head of the Civil Status and Civil Registry Department, Maj. Gen. Sanad Jamil, said that 86 people died on Saturday alone, indicating that the number of deaths in the southern city continues to mount. The department is tasked with issuing burial permits, and Jamil previously told Almasdar Online that prior to the month of May, the number of burial permits issued per day in Aden was between 9 and 12. </p><p>While comprehensive statistics for the causes of death remain lacking, and therefore uncertainty remains surrounding what proportion of the rise in deaths in Aden is attributable to COVID-19, statistics released by the Emergency Care Center at the Cuban Hospital in northern Aden indicate that several other epidemics and diseases are significant contributors to the death rate. </p><p>The Cuban Hospital announced that during a 48-hour period ending on Friday, the hospital had received 582 patients suffering from fevers.

The population has been weakened by the war.</p><p>In the capital, Sana'a, we are supporting the Ministry of Health at one of their COVID-19 treatment centres, including looking after the sickest patients in the intensive care unit. In Aden, we are also running a treatment centre, again with an intensive care unit, and again looking after very sick patients.</p><p>In Aden we see that people are really scared of the virus: other hospitals have closed because the staff are scared and cannot protect themselves. Many medical staff in the city have already become sick. This means we have more patients coming to our trauma hospital for treatment, which remains open despite the pandemic.</p><p>We also see this fear in the COVID-19 centre, where patients with severe breathing difficulties are arriving very late, apparently having been too scared to come to hospital.

The website explains that the plan proposed by the ministry recorded a deficit of 81%.</p><p>The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health, Al-Sana’ani, explained that the response from international organizations to the needs of the health sector did not exceed 9% in terms of infrastructure and 4% in terms of equipment.</p><p>The aforementioned are only some of the indirect effects of the Saudi/UAE war on Yemen. The Saudi American aggression has also been accused of deliberately targeting the health sector in Yemen.</p><p>Now that we further know the extent of damage endured by the health sector in Yemen and the brutality of such an aggression, although so much more has happened, let us ask the one question we all have in mind, “How will a country fighting for survival confront COVID-19?”</p><p>COVID-19’s first steps in Yemen </p><p>Coronavirus first made its entrance through Saudi-occupied Aden governorate, southern Yemen, according to local sources. The Saudi-affiliated government declared that a total number of 10 COVID-19 cases have been recorded in Early May in the governorate.</p><p>Measures taken by the capital Sana’a to confront COVID-19</p><p>So how prepared is Yemen for a new outbreak? In the capital Sana’a, it did halt the educational process, imposed preventative measures such as suspending halls for big events businesses, coffee shops and hair salons. However, it cannot enforce a quarantine since people live day by day in the country thus employees are waking up to normal days at work. Malls and markets are temporarily shut down to spray antiseptics as a precautionary measure against COVID-19.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.uprising.today/how-will-a-country-fighting-for-survival-confront-covid-19/">https://www.uprising.today/how-will-a-country-fighting-for-survival-confront-covid-19/</a></span></p><p>(A H P)</p><p>Combating Pandemic, Sana’a Continues to Close Malls, Markets from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am</p><p>The Technical Committee for the Prevention of coronavirus in Sana'a stressed the necessity of the continued closure of the malls and commercial markets from six in the evening until six in the morning to prevent the outbreak of the virus.</p><p>The committee also stressed during its meeting on Sunday the importance of strengthening the role of community committees in districts and neighborhoods to enhance precautionary measures.</p><p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=12966">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=12966</a></span></p><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p>Yemen records 6 new COVID-19 infections, 2 deaths</p><p>Six more COVID-19 infections have been recorded in Yemen, the official government-run anti-coronavirus supreme national committee (SNC) said Sunday, bringing the total to 132 cases including 21 deaths.<br />The new cases were detected in the eastern port city of Mukalla, including two deaths, SNC added on Twitter.</p><p><span><a href="https://debriefer.net/en/news-17246.html">https://debriefer.net/en/news-17246.html</a></span></p><p>(A H)</p><p>6 new cases of COVID-19 reported in Hadramout</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/22068">http://en.adenpress.news/news/22068</a></span></p><p>(A H)</p><p><span>89 people died in Yemen's </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Aden?src=hashtag_click">#Aden</a></span><span> on Sunday, director of Civil Registration Service said, adding that 69 death certificates were issued by police stations for people who presumably died "from natural causes"!

remains, health care workers warn the country's battle against the novel coronavirus is only beginning.</p><p>As life returns to a new normal throughout much of the world, health care workers in Yemen fear their war with the novel coronavirus has only just begun. </p><p>“The introduction of this virus in the current situation will be catastrophic,” Dr. Ilan Abdul Haq, a health official in the Taiz governorate, told Al-Monitor. “The health system has totally collapsed.”</p><p>As if the situation weren’t dire enough, the United Nations is now warning dozens of its major aid programs throughout the country will begin closing down unless urgent funding needs are met. At least $2 billion is required to sustain essential programming through December, the UN said.</p><p>Some 80% of services provided by the World Health Organization are on the chopping block. Should the global health agency decrease its services, patients could be forced to travel hundreds of miles for treatment where it remains available.</p><p>In a move that could trigger a domino effect, the WHO has started slashing incentive payments for more than 10,000 health care workers across Yemen who would not otherwise earn a living wage. </p><p>Some doctors in Hodeidah haven’t been paid in months, said Dr. Ali Abdullah Al-Ahdal, who runs the health department in the western province. Many have left in search of work elsewhere and he’s been forced to hire unqualified staff in their place. </p><p>"I see how impatient and angry the employees are,” Al-Ahdal told Al-Monitor. “We are trying to calm them down.”</p><p>The COVID-19 crisis is also deepening existing cash concerns at the UN’s Population Fund (UNFPA), which helps pregnant women and victims of domestic violence. Faced with a $59 million funding shortage, the UNFPA pulled its services from 140 health facilities on Friday, cutting off 320,000 pregnant women from specialized care. </p><p>Nestor Owomuhangi, UNFPA's acting representative to Yemen, said international donors need to chip in. “Otherwise, women and girls will die.”</p><p>“The health system is already on its knees,” said Sultana Begum, advocacy manager for Yemen at the Norwegian Refugee Council.</p><p>“COVID-19 is a double disaster on top of a very difficult humanitarian situation,” she told Al-Monitor. “What we really need to be doing in a time like this is scaling up aid, rather than scaling back.”</p><p>The United States and other donors accuse the Houthi rebels of interfering with food distribution and diverting supplies away from those who need it. After <span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/03/us-cuts-aid-yemen-coronavirus-houthi-restrictions.html">slashing $73 million</a></span> in assistance for that reason in March, the Trump administration announced earlier this month it would provide <span><a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/05/yemen-trump-houthi-who-covid19-coronavirus-un-aid.html">$225 million in emergency aid</a></span> for Yemen. </p><p>The aid package, officials said, would assist the World Food Program (WFP) with operations in southern Yemen and support “<span><a href="https://translations.state.gov/2020/05/06/special-briefing-via-telephone-on-yemen-humanitarian-aid/">critical life-saving NGO activity</a></span>” in the Houthi-held north. </p><p>“This is what politicization of aid looks like,” said Aisha Jumaan, president of the <span><a href="https://yemenfoundation.org/">Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation</a></span>. “I want them to define what critical services are. If food to help people who are experiencing famine is not critical, what is critical?”</p><p>Faced with dwindling food stocks, the WFP has scaled back the frequency of deliveries in northern Yemen. Families accustomed to receiving aid monthly now receive food assistance every other month.</p><p>The agency, which aims to feed around 12 million people across Yemen, hopes to scale up operations following a virtual donor conference hosted by the United Nations and Saudi Arabia on June 2. </p><p>But even if funding requests are met, the new pledges won’t mean an immediate restoration in aid, a WFP official told Al-Monitor.

After five years, the coalition has not been able to, and probably will never, defeat the Houthis.<br />Given the available information on the ongoing war's main events, one can assess why the Arab coalition cannot, at least, defeat the Yemeni Houthis, and sometimes incurs itself a defeat.<br />This can be attributed to reasons concerning the parties to the conflict. While the coalition armies' force depends on foreign modern ordnance and support from advanced countries, weapons do not always respond to current challenges, and their operators may not boast their skills in using them. This leads to grave losses when being ambushed, unable to fend off attacks by drones, etc.<br />Ansar Allah, however, are different in terms of ordnance, even with supplies from third countries they cannot radically change the situation. At the same time, the Houthis know the region well and are supported by local communities. They also learn fast, take in consideration the enemy's errors and actively use military advisors. As proven by practice, such a force is very difficult to fight.<br />Thus, the coalition is directly eager to end infeasible battles that lead to unnecessary losses and unjustified risks</p><p><span><a href="https://debriefer.net/en/news-17204.html">https://debriefer.net/en/news-17204.html</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>Marib, Last Hope for Restoring the State in Yemen</p><p>One of the great tragedies of this recent escalation is that Marib has actually made notable strides during the conflict to develop into a stronger and more vibrant region than existed before. The dynamics of the conflict pushed Marib out of its previous status quo even as the region itself remained relatively safe and unaffected by the fighting. The current escalation is threatening to destroy the progress Marib has made even during the difficulties of the past half-decade.</p><p>After the war started in 2014, Marib’s relative stability and its strong local leadership drastically changed the governorate, allowing a once underdeveloped region to become prosperous.</p><p>Today, there are more paved roads in Marib than ever before, and basic services have <span><a href="https://carnegie-mec.org/2019/07/31/marib-yemen-rising-above-conflict-pub-79593">improved dramatically</a></span> as the local economy has flourished. These improvements happened due to the political decentralization that occurred through the conflict: the capital was controlled by the Houthis and the alternative capital of Aden—currently home to the internationally recognized government—was unable to provide the stability needed for a state to have authority.</p><p>Now, ironically, the closest resemblance to a state is in Marib because of its strong rule of law and internal security. As such, Marib has become host to <span><a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/news/latest/2020/3/5e7dba1e4/yemen-sees-fresh-displacement-five-years-conflict.html">hundreds of thousands</a></span> of those who fled the war zones from all over the country. Marib has also served as a center for restructuring the national army in collaboration with the regional states and the international community to put an end to the Houthi coup d’état.</p><p>Not only has Marib developed structurally, but there have also been significant improvements from a human rights perspective. I personally have seen the local community in Marib change, especially regarding its attitude towards women. In 2010, I had founded a civil society organization we called <a href="http://maribgirls.org/home">Marib Girls Foundation</a> to empower women in Marib, but because the local environment at the time was not supportive of our work and the community was not ready to see women working in civil society, we had to shut the organization down. Since then, the armed conflict has created opportunities to challenge the area’s traditional outlook towards women.</p><p>The influx of those from more open communities in Sana’a has changed the dynamics of the Maribi society, inspiring Maribi women to engage in public and political life.

In many crises, good quality data are not always readily available, and both data collection and analysis processes have been undermined, distorted and in some cases shut down for political reasons. Sometimes governments or armed groups are the party influencing results for political ends, but it can also be agencies, donors, and even local leaders.</p><p>This study documents those political influences, noting separate influence on data collection and analysis processes and the way these play out. Famine analysis will never be free of political influences, but this study recommends good practice for better managing political influences.</p><p>This study considers the constraints on data collection and analysis in extreme food security emergencies in countries with a high risk of famine. In many contemporary crises, good quality data are not always readily available. Analysis procedures have built-in processes for ensuring the validity and reliability of data. But there is relatively little emphasis on analyzing what data are missing, why, where and when the data are missing, and what can or should be done about missing and poor-quality data. And there is little attempt to analyze the ways in which data collection or analyses processes are undermined or influenced by political factors rather than (or in addition to) being guided by the evidence. These problems are especially pronounced where there is a high risk of famine.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/politics-information-and-analysis-famines-and-extreme-emergencies-synthesis-findings">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/politics-information-and-analysis-famines-and-extreme-emergencies-synthesis-findings</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/the-politics-of-information-and-analysis-in-famines-and-extreme-emergencies-synthesis-of-findings-from-six-case-studies">https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/the-politics-of-information-and-analysis-in-famines-and-extreme-emergencies-synthesis-of-findings-from-six-case-studies</a></span></p><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p>MSF-Frachtflugzeug kommt am internationalen Flughafen von Sanaa an</p><p><span><a href="https://www.saba.ye/de/news3097149.htm">https://www.saba.ye/de/news3097149.htm</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Flash flooding has crippled families in Yemen this Ramadan</p><p>Islamic Relief is supporting families in Yemen who have been affected by severe flash flooding.

However, I am more concerned about upholding the ‘continuum of care’ in Yemen. If we focus on this virus alone, we leave behind the rest of the Yemenis suffering from other illnesses, and we cannot afford to do that,” said Dr. Muhammad Fawad Khan, Health Cluster Coordinator in Yemen.</p><p>Level of exposure and surveillance are crucial</p><p>More than 1 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) currently live in informal and spontaneous sites across Yemen. These populations are particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 epidemic and other communicable diseases due to overcrowding, poor access to safe water and sanitation, and limited access to health services. In the absence of control measures, these sites will likely experience very high occurrence and mortality rates.</p><p>“This would translate into an unprecedented number of patients requiring intensive care over a very short period of time, which they will not receive,” said Winnie Mbusya, Manager of the Yemen Displacement Response Consortium.</p><p>But the reality of the impending magnitude and scope of COVID-19 has begun to weigh on front-line responders and humanitarians. They also worry about their own safety, knowing that if they get sick, they will no longer be able to help or treat those in need.</p><p>“We need to stay and deliver, but we also have to be realistic. To effectively support communities, we need to also be able to protect ourselves, to understand the risks we are exposed to. There is a lack of access to health services for front-line workers and in testing capacity and surveillance within Yemen. We all need to work together to improve this,” said Ms. Mbusya.</p><p>The long and tough road ahead</p><p>As the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Yemen continue to rise, the UN and its partners are working to ensure that everyone is doing their part in response to the pandemic. But there is no mistaking that the road ahead will be long and rough.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.unocha.org/story/yemen-health-cluster-%E2%80%98we-need-respond-all-health-needs-not-just-covid-19%E2%80%99">https://www.unocha.org/story/yemen-health-cluster-%E2%80%98we-need-respond-all-health-needs-not-just-covid-19%E2%80%99</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Yemen Food Security Outlook Update April 2020</p><p>Despite the announcement of a unilateral ceasefire by Saudi Arabia, high levels of conflict continue to disrupt livelihoods and restrict access to income in Yemen, with prices of food and non-food commodities substantially higher than pre-conflict levels. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are widespread, with a growing number of people – increasing within the range of 17 to 19 million – expected to be in urgent need of humanitarian assistance through September. The severity of acute food insecurity within the population already facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes is expected to increase, with some households across Yemen expected to deteriorate to Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5).</p><p>Persistent conflict and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions – as well as some COVID-19 related disruptions – are resulting in further food price increases and restricted income-earning opportunities. Given this and significant reductions to humanitarian assistance in northern areas, area-level Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are expected in Hajjah, Sa’dah, Amran, Al Mahwit, and Al Bayda between June and September, with localized deterioration likely in other areas. A risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) persists in Yemen. Famine would be possible if the country’s capacity to import food is severely limited or if food supplies to particular areas are restricted for a prolonged period of time. Although it is not the most likely scenario, if deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and COVID-19 impacts result in prolonged and severe physical or economic constraints to food access, extreme levels of food insecurity would be likely.</p><p>The exchange rate remained stable between February and March but depreciated through mid-April according to FAO. The exchange rate remains higher in southern areas. In the coming months, currency shortages are expected to continue worsening, with reduced remittances from abroad expected to contribute to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and reduced access to income. Given lower food import levels and rising food prices, both physical and economic access to food are of concern for an increasing number of people.</p><p><span><a href="https://fews.net/east-africa/yemen/food-security-outlook-update/april-2020">https://fews.net/east-africa/yemen/food-security-outlook-update/april-2020</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp4 Flüchtlinge / Refugees</span></h2><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p>Joint [anti-Houthi] Forces Arrest Illegal Migrants</p><p>The joint forces on the West Coast have apprehended on Monday night, four Somali migrants coming by sea from Djibouti after they illegally entered the Yemeni territory, Al-Amalika Media Centre reported.<br />Military official said that the four men were taken to the health centre to make sure that they are not infected with the novel coronavirus disease, before referring them to the competent authorities.</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/22079">http://en.adenpress.news/news/22079</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Yemen Fact Sheet - Protecting displaced families in Yemen, May 2020</p><p>Why protection?</p><p>The ongoing conflict, attacks and violations of human rights over the past five years have left an indelible impact on civilians.

During the current week, UNHCR began an emergency cash distribution to some 4,750 recently displaced families in Marib governorate, as an urgent response to the recent displacement following floods. Each family received YER 100,000 to address their urgent needs such as food, rent and medicine. Considering the high number (some 15 per cent) of potential beneficiaries without identification, mitigating measures such as designating alternative collection points or delivering cash-in-hand were put into place.</p><p>As heavy rains continue to ravage the country, damage to shelters, roads, farms and electricity grids were particularly severe in the west of Yemen, Hajjah and Raymah governorates, affecting some 6,500 families who now require immediate support with shelter and household items. UNHCR is working with Shelter and Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM)<br />Cluster partners to coordinate a response. In Abs, Hajjah governorate, 2,400 families received basic household items and food, while 960 families received emergency cash assistance. Other affected areas are scheduled for protection assessments and emergency distributions as soon as access is granted and weather conditions permit.</p><p>Clashes in Al Bayda governorate forced at least 600 families to flee to various districts in neighbouring Abyan in the south. Further displacements due to ongoing fighting are expected in the coming days</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-unhcr-operational-update-14-may-2020">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-unhcr-operational-update-14-may-2020</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fortsetzung / Sequel: cp5 – cp18</span></h2><p><strong><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-652b-yemen-war-mosaic-652b">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-652b-yemen-war-mosaic-652b</a> </strong></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vorige / Previous:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-651-yemen-war-mosaic-651">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-651-yemen-war-mosaic-651</a> </p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 1-651 / Yemen War Mosaic 1-651:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose</a> oder / or <a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Der saudische Luftkrieg im Bild / Saudi aerial war images:</span></h2><p><span>(18 +, Nichts für Sensible!) / (18 +; Graphic!)</span></p><p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/">http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://www.yemenwar.info/">http://www.yemenwar.info/</a> </span></p><p>Liste aller Luftangriffe / and list of all air raids:</p><p><span><a href="http://yemendataproject.org/data/">http://yemendataproject.org/data/</a></span></p><p>Untersuchung ausgewählter Luftangriffe durch Bellingcat / Bellingcat investigations of selected air raids:</p><p><span><a href="https://yemen.bellingcat.com/">https://yemen.bellingcat.com/</a></span></p><p><span>Untersuchungen von Angriffen, hunderte von Filmen / Investigations of attacks, hundreds of films:</span></p><p><span><a href="https://yemeniarchive.org/en">https://yemeniarchive.org/en</a></span></p></div>
