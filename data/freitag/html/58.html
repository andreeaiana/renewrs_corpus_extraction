Are therefore European arms companies’ executives and licensing officials potentially aiding and abetting alleged war crimes committed by the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in Yemen? This question is at the core of a ground-breaking Communication submitted to the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on 11 December 2019.</p><p>In a joint Communication the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (<a href="https://www.ecchr.eu/">ECCHR</a>), <a href="https://mwatana.org/en/">Mwatana for Human Rights</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a>, the <a href="https://www.caat.org.uk/">Campaign Against Arms Trade</a>, <a href="http://www.centredelas.org/en/">Centre Delàs</a> and <a href="https://www.disarmo.org/">Rete Disarmo</a> call upon the OTP to investigate the legal responsibility of corporate and political actors from Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the UK.</p><p>The Communication focuses on the role of the following companies: Airbus Defence and Space S.A. (Spain), Airbus Defence and Space GmbH (Germany), BAE Systems Plc. (UK), Dassault Aviation S.A. (France), Leonardo S.p.A. (Italy), MBDA UK Ltd. (UK), MBDA France S.A.S. (France), Raytheon Systems Ltd. (UK), Rheinmetall AG (Germany) through its subsidiary RMW Italia (Italy) and Thales (France).</p><p>Despite documented attacks on civilian homes, markets, hospitals and schools conducted by the Saudi/UAE-led military coalition, several transnational companies based in Europe continued and continue to supply Saudi Arabia and the UAE with weapons, ammunition and logistical support. European government officials authorized the exports by granting licenses.</p><p>“Saudi/UAE-led coalition airstrikes have caused terrible destruction in Yemen. Weapons produced and exported by the US and Europe have enabled this destruction. Five years into this war, the countless Yemeni victims deserve credible investigations into all perpetrators of crimes against them, including those potentially complicit. We’re hoping that the ICC can play a role in starting to fill the current, cavernous accountability gap in Yemen,” stated <a href="https://mwatana.org/en/radhya-chosen-as-human-rights-defender/">Radhya Almutawakel</a>, chairperson of Yemeni organization Mwatana for Human Rights.</p><p>“European companies – and indirectly European states – have profited from arms exports to the Saudi/UAE-led coalition. At the same time these arms are used in Yemen in international humanitarian law violations that may amount to war crimes,” said <a href="https://www.ecchr.eu/en/person/linde-bryk/">Linde Bryk</a>, Legal Advisor at ECCHR, on behalf of the organizations that submitted the Communication. “By seeking an investigation into corporate executives and government officials the Communication seeks to hold to account powerful actors involved in the arms trade and to close the corporate impunity gap.”</p><p>The 350-page Communication drafted by ECCHR and substantiated by evidence gathered by Mwatana for Human Rights on-site in Yemen details 26 airstrikes conducted by the Saudi/UAE-led coalition which may amount to war crimes under the Rome Statute.</p><p><a href="https://www.ecchr.eu/nc/en/press-release/made-in-europe-bombed-in-yemen/">https://www.ecchr.eu/nc/en/press-release/made-in-europe-bombed-in-yemen/</a></p><p>and full documents:</p><p>Made in Europe, bombed in Yemen: How the ICC could tackle the responsibility of arms exporters and government officials</p><p><a href="https://www.ecchr.eu/fileadmin/Fallbeschreibungen/CaseReport_ECCHR_Mwatana_Amnesty_CAAT_Delas_Rete.pdf">https://www.ecchr.eu/fileadmin/Fallbeschreibungen/CaseReport_ECCHR_Mwatana_Amnesty_CAAT_Delas_Rete.pdf</a></p><p>Accountability for alleged war crimes in Yemen – The responsibility of European arms exporters is a case for the ICC</p><p><a href="https://www.ecchr.eu/fileadmin/Q_As/QA_ICC_arms_Yemen_ECCHR_CAAT_Mwatana_Amnesty_Delas_Rete.pdf">https://www.ecchr.eu/fileadmin/Q_As/QA_ICC_arms_Yemen_ECCHR_CAAT_Mwatana_Amnesty_Delas_Rete.pdf</a></p><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>YEMEN DATA PROJECT AIR RAIDS SUMMARY DECEMBER 2019</strong></p><p>Bombings and Civilian Deaths at Record Low</p><p>Coalition air raids* continued to decline significantly in November with bombings down by 53% to 39 from the previous all-time low <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ab780345d5c3/november2019-yemen-data-project-update-589663">recorded in October</a> . Civilian casualty numbers also fell by a third to 6 in November from 9 in the previous month.

The bombing on 1 November of a civilian house in a residential area in the district of Baqim in Sa'ada killed 2 civilians, including 1 woman and injured 4 more civilians, including 2 children. The two civilian deaths in November matched July 2019 for the lowest number of civilian fatalities recorded in a single month since the air war began in 2015.</p><p>Uptick in Air Raids in Al-Hudaydah</p><p>Saudi/UAE-led coalition air raids targeted 6 of Yemen's 22 governorates in November. 87% of bombings in the month hit the three most heavily bombed governorates of Sa'ada (22), Al-Hudaydah (6) and Hajja (6). Six air raids in Al-Hudaydah - including one on Ras Issa port - marked the highest number recorded in a single month in the governorate since January 2019. A tentative ceasefire in Al-Hudaydah announced in December 2018 led to a decline in bombings. Seven air raids were recorded in Al-Hudaydah from February to the end of September this year before a spike in bombings in October (4) and November (6).</p><p>Saudi/UAE-led coalition air raids fell by 53% in November to 39 from 83 in October.</p><p>Sa'ada continues to be the most heavily bombed governorate in the air war. In November, 22 air raids were recorded in the governorate, down from 41 in October. Sa'ada was the target of 56% of all coalition bombings in November. Six civilian casualties were recorded in a single air raid. Al-Dhaher on the western border of the governorate was the most heavily targeted district in the country in November with 7 air raids.</p><p>Sa'ada has been the <a href="https://mailchi.mp/5ccc4f828655/january2019-yemen-data-project-update-456659">most heavily bombed governorate</a> in Yemen since the Saudi/UAE-led air campaign began. Almost a quarter (24%) of all recorded air raids in Yemen since March 2015 have targeted Sa'ada.</p><p>Hajja was, along with Al-Hudaydah, the second most heavily targeted governorate in November with 6 air raids. No civilian casualties were recorded. This was a 78% decline from the 27 air raids in the Hajja in October and the lowest number of bombings in the governorate since the 2016 ceasefire.

I</p><p>however the same news outlets who are trying to convince us of the “internationally recognised” government, are the same ones peddling the misleading narrative, that the NSG are merely “Houthi rebels” or “Iranian proxies”, following Tehran’s orders.</p><p>Essentially, this agreement stalled the inevitability that the Saudis, and the wider international community, will have to accept the reality that the NSG (“Houthis”) are the legitimate government in Yemen. I am using the past-tense here because the agreement is void and <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20191210-saudi-backed-yemen-government-and-separatists-miss-riyadh-agreement-deadline/">no longer exists</a> – it was signed on 5 November and included a 30-day deadline in forming a new cabinet of 24 members, equally split from the north and south. I concluded with the revelation that the Saudis had acknowledged that they had opened channels of communication with the Houthis.</p><p>Who speaks for the south?</p><p><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20191210-saudi-backed-yemen-government-and-separatists-miss-riyadh-agreement-deadline/">The Riyadh Agreement</a> was always problematic from the outset, because although on paper it was plausible, the reality on the ground, in particular in the interim capital city of Aden, was another thing entirely.</p><p>It is important to recognise that the STC does not speak for all southerners, nor for the Southern Movement. There is <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190904-new-resistance-movement-announced-in-south-yemen/">the Southern National Salvation Council</a> (SSC) based in Mahrah, who not only oppose both Saudi and Emirati interference in Yemen, but had opposed the Riyadh Agreement from its inception, noting that “the agreement gives legitimacy to regional militias affiliated abroad,” with reference to the STC.</p><p>The director of Human Rights for Yemen, <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180129-yemeni-rights-group-apply-to-british-dpp-for-arrest-warrant-to-prosecute-ibn-salman/">Kim Sharif</a>, explained to MEMO that the SSC is composed of the “original secessionists” and that the STC are widely regarded as a “traitor entity” by most southerners, as they are a party formed by the UAE who are using and exploiting the memory of the South Yemen state.</p><p>Illegitimacy of Hadi vs legitimacy of the NSG</p><p>Sharif agrees that the Hadi government lacks legitimacy, because following the election where he stood as the sole candidate, he was appointed as president for a transitional period of two years as part of the <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20150206-kuwaiti-official-gulf-initiative-did-not-include-the-transfer-of-power-from-the-yemeni-president-to-a-presidential-council/">Gulf Initiative</a> back in February 2012, reluctantly accepted by many, to avoid further bloodshed. Under the initiative, elections were to be held within the transitional period.</p><p>However, this failed to materialise and according to Sharif, under Hadi assassinations and terrorist attacks began to increase “funded by the Saudis,” and with a reliance on the <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20191017-saudi-troops-arrive-in-yemens-aden-as-deal-with-separatists-stalls/">Islah Party militia</a>, who have close ties with <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190912-revival-not-revolution-in-southern-yemen/">General Mohsen Al-Ahmar</a>, the vice president whose links to Al-Qaeda are well-documented. Hadi formerly resigned from the presidency in 2015, but has held onto the position ever since, giving him “zero legitimacy”. “There’s no such thing as an ‘internationally recognised government’ under international law. This is sheer abuse of the terms of the <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20191211-iraqi-foreign-ministry-summons-ambassadors-of-four-western-countries/">Vienna Convention</a> on diplomatic relations and is a totally unacceptable trespass on the sovereignty of the state of Yemen,” Sharif continued.</p><p>Meanwhile, with regards to the legitimacy of the National Salvation Government based in Sanaa, Sharif described the 2014 takeover within the context of the failure by Hadi to carry out elections as per his mandate. Additionally, under International Customary Law, whomever takes control of the capital of any country is considered the “de facto” government. In order for this to be ratified, the government has to become “de jure”. Sharif argues that such a government must first follow an “internal legislation process”, which the Sanaa government has done by preserving national institutions, creating the Supreme Council, which includes all political parties including southern secessionists and operates within the existing constitution.</p><p>International recognition</p><p>The National Salvation Government is not only arguably the legitimate government of Yemen. The</p><p>As the Riyadh Agreement gradually fades into obscurity, and the Saudis and its allies begin to sue for peace and pay for the damage that they caused, in the realisation that it is the Houthi government which is the legitimate power and authority in the country, it is high time that the international community start recognising this too, at the expense of the puppet government based in Riyadh headed by Hadi, who effectively has been held in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/yemen-president-hadi-house-arrest-riyadh-171107082638642.html">captivity</a> there and does not speak for the Yemeni people nor has control of the armed forces.

This report explores how gender norms have shaped Yemenis’ experience of conflict, and how conflict is reshaping gender norms in Yemen.</p><p>The report is based on qualitative research, including 88 focus group discussions conducted across Yemen from November 2018 to February 2019, 49 key informant interviews, six case studies and a literature review. The focus group discussions included 674 participants in eight districts representing different political and socio-economic contexts — near and far from the fighting and on both sides of the frontlines. These were: Al-Sabeen and Bani Harith in Amanat al-Asimah, Sana’a city; Mukalla and Sayoun in Hadramawt governorate; Sheikh Othman and Seera in Aden governorate; and Al-Shamayatan and Al-Qahira in Taiz governorate.</p><p>Focus group discussion participants and key informants in all areas perceived that financial strain has pressed women into the workforce, severely impacted boys and girls in terms of access to education and vulnerability to gender-based violence, and driven a rise in multiple forms of gender-based violence.</p><p>Prior to the current conflict, around half of Yemenis lived in poverty and more than 40 percent were food insecure.<a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/8480#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The economy contracted by more than 40 percent during the first three years of the war,<a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/8480#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> with many businesses collapsing or downsizing. More than 1.2 million public sector workers — and their families — were affected by the suspension of government salaries in September 2016.<a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/8480#_ftn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Unemployment and underemployment, as well as salary suspensions and the depreciation of the Yemeni rial, have dragged the middle class toward or into poverty and those already in poverty into destitution. While payments to some public sector workers have resumed, some 20 million of Yemen’s 28 million people continue to face severe or acute food insecurity.<a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/8480#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p><p>Focus group discussion participants and key informants perceived women and men as having navigated the country’s new economic reality differently. Many said women were generally proactive and creative in seeking paid work, while some men were reluctant to work in jobs they considered unsuitable or were pressured – economically and by traditional definitions of masculinity — into joining fighting forces to support their families.</p><p>Some participants and key informants in all areas noted more positive male attitudes emerging during the war toward women working, saying, for example, that men increasingly seek brides who are employed in contrast to a pre-war tendency toward seeking a housewife. Indications were more mixed, however, as to whether women’s economic empowerment was expanding their influence in family decision-making or would last beyond the conflict – indicating an area where post-war support could be critical.</p><p>In exploring the gendered consequences of the conflict on Yemen’s youth, this report finds that the prospects of a generation of Yemeni boys and girls as well as young adults have been compromised by the conflict-driven devastation of education. War-related economic and security factors are magnifying the societal problem of early marriage, especially among girls, and are driving boys out of school and into the ranks of fighting forces.</p><p>Prior to the conflict, poverty and lack of access to schools in rural areas had limited families’ abilities to educate their children, and war has only compounded this problem. Yemenis report having to choose between feeding or educating their children, being unable to afford transport costs or school needs such as uniforms and books. With teachers unpaid or the value of their salaries depreciated by rampant inflation, many lack motivation, are preoccupied with securing extra outside income or have joined frontlines. Stress due to the war and economic collapse has affected teachers’ behavior toward students, and students report to class hungry and displaying symptoms of trauma.</p><p>War is also magnifying existing gender and power inequalities that lie at the root of gender-based violence (GBV). The imprecision and scarcity of baseline statistics on GBV in Yemen complicates efforts to identify trends, however participants and key informants perceived that the incidence of multiple forms of physical and sexual violence had increased during the conflict in the home and in public spaces.</p><p>This report focuses on the gendered experience of the war in terms of the economic crisis, which was widely perceived to have magnified other existing domestic and societal issues facing women, girls, men and boys. It also looks closely at the gendered experience of the war on Yemen’s youths – boys and girls as well as young adults – and on the nature and, as much as possible within the limitations of the study, the extent of physical and sexual violence at home and in the community.</p><p>The following emerged as the key perceptions of focus group participants and key informants:</p><p>Women have shown resilience to economic challenges, displaying flexibility and innovation as they are pushed into seeking paid work. Women are starting businesses at home, online and in the community, and working in nontraditional sectors. Opportunities available to illiterate and uneducated women often have been precarious and low-paid.</p><p>Attitudes appear to be changing toward women working. Yet, the sustainability of their increased economic empowerment is uncertain. Shifts in household gender roles have been limited. Women’s economic empowerment often was associated with a diminution of men’s status.</p><p>Lack of income has undermined men’s traditional role as breadwinner and has affected family life. Men have moved to jobs of lower social status than their previous roles and have been driven to frontlines seeking a salary. Pressure to conform to masculine norms also has influenced the decision to fight.</p><p>Children are dropping out of school. Rising poverty has left parents unable to afford to educate their children<strong>. </strong>Girls are more likely to be withdrawn from school than boys, for cultural, economic and security reasons. Boys leave school to earn money — driven by family financial need — and sometimes to join armed groups. Armed violence at and near schools has stopped some parents from sending their sons and daughters to school.</p><p>Gender-based violence has increased during the conflict. Women and girls have been affected by rape, kidnapping, sexual harassment and domestic violence perpetrated by militias and community members as well as husbands, fathers and brothers. Sexual violence against boys is also widespread.</p><p>Financial insecurity is the primary driver of an increase in gender-based violence. Women also are blamed, by men and women, for violence against them.</p><p>The incidence of early marriage has risen. Girls are married early, driven by economic pressure and fears for their safety in an unstable security environment.</p><p>Impunity for gender-based violence is growing. Social protections have diminished and state and judicial systems are not functioning.</p><p>Recommendations are offered at the end of this report to guide domestic and international stakeholders to help alleviate the war’s varied impact on women, girls, men and boys.</p><p><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/8480">https://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/8480</a></p><p>and full report: <a href="https://sanaacenter.org/files/A_Gendered_Crisis_en.pdf">https://sanaacenter.org/files/A_Gendered_Crisis_en.pdf</a></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Inside the UAE's lobbying efforts to lift European weapons-export bans</strong></p><p>The United Arab Emirates has lobbied several European countries to ease restrictions on weapons exports following a series of strikes in the Gulf this year, according to three Western diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the discussions.</p><p>Emirati officials have in the discussions with European counterparts stressed the Gulf state’s need to defend itself while highlighting the UAE’s drawdown of troops in Yemen, the five people with knowledge of the discussions said.

What has been implemented so far? And what lessons have been learned? </p><p>Almasdar Online English takes a look at the key milestones of the Stockholm Agreement, from the signing to the controversial redeployment of forces, and analyzes where the agreement now stands.</p><p>On Sept. 9, the RCC held its sixth meeting, chaired by the Deputy Head of the UN mission to support the Hodeidah agreement, and the participation of the Houthi and government delegations, focusing on activating the ceasefire and de-escalation mechanism initially agreed in mid-July.</p><p>The parties agreed that the Joint Operations Centre (observation posts) of the UN mission at the Hodeidah facility would be established and activated, and that the center would include liaison and coordination officers from both parties, as well as UN liaison and coordination officers.</p><p>Since the ceasefire agreement in Hodeidah came into effect, the truce has been shaky and violated from all sides, and the UN has frequently described it as a very fragile truce. Sporadic fighting has resumed in Hodeidah since January, but in September and August a major escalation was seen that coincided with the UAE-backed insurgency in Aden.</p><p>Since the Indian general officially took office in early October, after holding a series of meetings with Houthi, Saudi, and government leaders in Sana’a and Riyadh, and bilateral meetings with the two parties delegations in the redeployment committee, the Houthis have foiled attempts to hold a joint meeting of the redeployment committee and prevented the government team from reaching the ship, according to Wadhah Al-Dubaish, the spokesman for the government’s west coast forces.</p><p>In a small achievement early in his tenure, the general created a mechanism for establishing a ceasefire, where he was able to oversee the deployment of five contact and monitoring points along the battle fronts in Hodeidah. However, continued violations have undermined the achievement.</p><p>Al-Dubaish, the spokesman for the joint forces on the west coast, however, said that the five observation points that were established on the outskirts of Hodeidah from several directions did not play any role, and that the activation of these points came as a cover for the Houthis with a clear distinction and inaction from the UN.</p><p>Joha's latest statement condemned the escalation by both sides in Hodeidah, and shortly after the release of his statement he was stopped by the Houthis and prevented from travelling for several hours.</p><p>In a briefing to the Security Council on Nov. 22, Griffiths expressed concern about the increasing restrictions on the movement of mission staff in Hodeidah. </p><p>General Joha faces greater difficulties in implementing the agreement, for several reasons, including, according to experts, the ambiguity and gaps in its terms, which bear different interpretations, such as the identity of the local security forces and the authority that will take over the city after the implementation of the re-deployment of forces from the city and ports. Nevertheless, a year after the signing of the agreement, which is widely seen by Yemenis as having been imposed by foreign rather than domestic powers, it is clear that no significant progress has been made in achieving its stated goals, and lives continue to be lost on a daily basis. The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, and instead of bringing Yemen closer to a comprehensive peace agreement, it has made the warring parties apprehensive about entering into new ceasefire monitoring or similar agreements, and eroded trust in the office of the UN Special Envoy. </p><p><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/176">https://al-masdaronline.net/national/176</a></p><p>(A K pS)</p><p>Houthis target joint forces in east Hodeidah</p><p><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/15046">http://en.adenpress.news/news/15046</a></p><p>(* B K pH)</p><p>Revealing Violations by US-SaudiI Aggression in Hodeidah since Signing Stockholm Agreement</p><p>Violations of the forces of the Saudi-American aggression since the beginning of the ceasefire until today in Hodeidah governorate, according to official sources, have reached more than 30,903 violations, resulting in killing and injurying of 656 citizens, including children and women.</p><p>Statistics revealed by the Armed Forces spokesman confirmed that the number of martyrs due to breaches of the aggression and its mercenaries amounted to 175 citizens were killed, including 63 children, 27 women and 85 men, while the number of 481 citizens were wounded, including 169 children, 97 women and 215 men.</p><p>Brigadier General Yahya Sare'e said that the forces of aggression and their mercenaries are still continuing the siege on the city of Ad-durayhimi and preventing the delivery of food and medicine to the besieged citizens.</p><p><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=10244">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=10244</a></p><p><span>(A K pH)</span></p><p>Eine Frau getötet, andere und ein Kind Verletzt nach dem Bombenangriff der Aggressionstruppen auf Hodeidah</p><p><a href="https://www.saba.ye/de/news3081649.htm">https://www.saba.ye/de/news3081649.htm</a></p><p>(A K pH)</p><p>US-Saudi Aggression’s Daily Update for Saturday, December 14th, 2019</p><p><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=10246">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=10246</a></p><p>(* A K P)</p><p>Yemen Warring Parties to Meet aboard UN Ship Next Week</p><p>A meeting is expected to be held between representatives from the Yemeni legitimate government, the United Nations and Iran-aligned Houthi militias on a UN ship off the coast of Hodeidah on Wednesday, Yemeni sources told Asharq Al-Awsat.<br /> The ship, Antarctic Dream, is docked around 30 kilometers off Hodeidah port.<br /> The meeting marks a year since the signing of the Stockholm deal that was reached between warring parties in December 2018 in Sweden's capital and established the Redeployment Coordination Committee, a body set up by the UN to oversee the ceasefire and troop exit in Hodeidah.<br /><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/2036671/yemen-warring-parties-meet-aboard-un-ship-next-week">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/2036671/yemen-warring-parties-meet-aboard-un-ship-next-week</a></p><p>(A K pS)</p><p>9 Houthis killed in attack against Yemeni govt forces</p><p>17 rebels injured in attack on Ad Durayhimi district south of Al-Hudayda</p><p>Nine Houthis rebels were killed in an attack against Yemen government forces in Yemen, authorities said Sunday.</p><p>Military spokesman for the Yemeni Joint Forces on the West Coast, Wadah Al-Dabish, told Anadolu Agency that 17 rebels were also injured in the attack on the Ad Durayhimi district south of Al-Hudayda.</p><p><a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/9-houthis-killed-in-attack-against-yemeni-govt-forces-/1673993">https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/9-houthis-killed-in-attack-against-yemeni-govt-forces-/1673993</a></p><p>(A K pH)</p><p>[Sanaa gov.] Yemeni army warns Saudi-led coalition against further Hudaydah truce violations</p><p>The spokesman for Yemeni Armed Forces has warned against the continued violation of a UN-backed agreement signed between representatives from the Houthi Ansarullah movement and the Riyadh-sponsored government of ex-president, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, in Sweden last year, saying such infringements have led to the deaths and injuries of hundreds of civilians.</p><p>Brigadier General Yahya Saree said on Saturday that the Saudi-led coalition and its mercenaries continue to flout the agreement and keep on implementing escalatory steps in the strategic Red Sea port city of Hudaydah, stressing that such actions will have dire repercussions.</p><p><a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/12/14/613681/Yemeni-army-warns-Saudi-led-coalition-against-Hudaydah-truce-violations">https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/12/14/613681/Yemeni-army-warns-Saudi-led-coalition-against-Hudaydah-truce-violations</a></p><p>(A K pH)</p><p>In Kilo-16, A woman was killed, another one and a child were injured with US-Saudi mercenaries' artillery shells.

But the refugee movement has been reversed since late 2014.</p><p>One of the Yemeni refugees, Saleh al-Amodi, said he made it to Somalia in 2014 after a risky journey, in which he sailed on a small boat from the Gulf of Aden in southwest Yemen to Bosaso port in northeastern Somalia.<br /> "I was lucky I made it safely to Somalia. A number of people have died in the journey through the sea after their boats sank. Sometimes clashes take place just before the coastal area of Yemen, and a missile might hit one of the fragile boats, sinking its passengers," al-Amodi told VOA.<br /> Weeks before he could leave, Al-Amodi sent his wife and two children to safety in Saudi Arabia. By the time he tried to join them in, Saudi authorities had already closed their borders. The family have been separated since then.<br /> "Anyone who tries to illegally cross to neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Oman will be shot or arrested. I haven’t seen my family for almost five years," al-Amodi said.<br /> ‘We are only seeking some dignity’<br /> Al-Amodi was placed in a refugee camp in Khahda district, which is near the Somali capital, Mogadishu, shortly after his arrival.

As such, “it is widely seen as a stop-gap measure to prevent a civil war within a war, and improve the government’s credibility as a player in UN-led peace talks,” he told MEMO. He assumes that the incentive for the STC is a place at the talks, where it can raise its call for southern independence.</p><p>But the southerners’ independence agenda may trigger new tensions as soon as this issue appears at the negotiating table. According to Augustin, nothing has really changed as “the STC has been very clear since its emergence that its major objective is the re-establishment of the state in south Yemen on its pre-1990 borders and the Riyadh agreement had not changed this objective.”</p><p>If the STC had given up this goal, she is convinced that the people in the south would then form another entity that advocates the same goal.</p><p>However, the representation of south and north Yemen remains problematic, according to many authors, as the agreement failed to adopt an inclusive approach and ignores several factions, including southern factions that are not aligned with the STC. Mareike Transfeld from the Free University in Berlin observes that many political forces in Yemen claim to represent large geographical areas, but none of them were democratically elected, so it is highly debatable whether they represent the people or areas that they control.</p><p>Gerald Feierstein, Senior Vice President of the Middle East Institute and former US ambassador to Yemen, thinks that it is for Yemenis to work out the terms of their political agreements going forward. According to him it will be important for the process to be inclusive and to give all Yemenis the sense that their interests are being addressed.</p><p>As for Salisbury, he believes the deal gives the Saudis a fair bit of wriggle room to push for more inclusion during the government formation period and they are likely to try and make the future cabinet more representative of all the different factions aligned against the Houthis.</p><p>Another problematic detail is related to Saudi supervision of the new government and the whole agreement. Keeping the fate of Yemen in the hands of Saudi Arabia, (which is responsible for Yemen’s tragedy) actually legitimises the Saudi-UAE interference in Yemeni affairs, and limits the sovereignty of the state.

Here’s what will help bring peace.</p><p>Here’s how mediation from other countries can end civil wars.</p><p>What does the intervening coalition’s slow but steady drawdown mean for Yemen’s civil war? While there is still a long way to go to reach a lasting peace in Yemen, this moment probably marks the beginning of the end of the war — or at least this phase of the war. Whether the civil war in Yemen ends for good will depend in part on the role of external actors.</p><p>Why this time is different</p><p>The idea that the Yemen civil war could end following the coalition’s drawdown may at first glance read as overly optimistic. Cease-fires and peace negotiations in Yemen have faltered plenty of times in recent years. Most recently, southern factions <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/peace-deal-yemens-south-stumbles-deadline-expires-041405830.html">failed to reach</a> a power-sharing agreement before the Dec. 5 deadline, even at the urging of their Saudi and Emirati backers.</p><p>Current circumstances point to reasons for cautious optimism. The Trump administration has subtly changed its messaging on the conflict in recent days. Previously, administration officials had painted the Houthis as Iranian proxies and Yemen as an arena for regional conflict with Iran, thus justifying the coalition intervention.</p><p>Last week, however, State Department Iran envoy Brian Hook sought to draw a line between the Houthis and Iran, stating that “Iran clearly does not speak for the Houthis” and <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/12/state-department-hook-shift-yemen-houthi-independent-iran.html">implying</a> that the Houthis are playing a constructive role in peace talks.</p><p>The rhetorical shift implies that U.S. officials may be genuinely interested in ending the conflict rather than continuing to support the coalition as part of a broader “maximum pressure” strategy on Iran.</p><p>Another obstacle to a lasting settlement may be Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s diverging interests in Yemen: Saudi Arabia is primarily concerned with dislodging the Houthis and reducing Iranian influence, while Emirati leaders want to prevent the influence of Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated parties and expand their <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/constructing-commercial-empire-united-arab-emirates-red-sea-horn/?mc_cid=a614b2a8af&amp;mc_eid=6825608b63&amp;agreed=1">commercial empire</a> and military presence along the Red Sea coast. However, both countries receive billions of dollars in <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20190531_IN11127_297d460d051add1042e0334c5d670940a5e2d527.pdf">arms sales</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/foreign-military-training-pensacola-florida-shooting.html">training</a> from the United States, giving the United States considerable leverage. This leverage can help get these regional partners on board.</p><p>Peace agreements are more likely to last when they include <a href="https://www.ipinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IPI-E-pub-Reimagining-Peacemaking.pdf">women</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03050629.2012.659139?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&amp;journalCode=gini20">civil society actors</a> at the negotiating table. Inclusive negotiations are better able to reflect and account for a broader range of concerns. In 2011, a regional initiative brokered Yemen’s National Dialogue Conference (NDC), meant to lead to new elections after Yemen’s Arab Spring movement. While the NDC required that a certain proportion of delegates be women, southerners or young people, the process failed in part because it lacked true grass-roots participation and buy-in. This time, the international community has the opportunity to play a more constructive role in encouraging a genuinely inclusive peace process.</p><p><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691141466/securing-the-peace">Security sector reform</a> also contributes to the durability of peace agreements. There is <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/yemen-national-chaos-local-order">a multitude</a> of local security groups that will need to be reconciled to and integrated within the state that emerges from a peace process.

Obama administration officials <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/kerrys-shameful-praise-for-the-war-on-yemen/">spoke</a> about U.S. support for the war, and they told some <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/kerrys-lies-about-the-war-on-yemen/">egregious lies</a> about the war, but Obama himself said nothing. That policy remains one of Obama’s <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/obamas-horrible-legacy-in-yemen/">most shameful and destructive legacies</a>, and it is a black mark on his foreign policy record that won’t be erased by anything he says now. It may be that Obama thinks that he can avoid scrutiny of this part of his record by not calling attention to it, but if so he is mistaken. Biden’s newfound opposition to the war should make it impossible for Obama to escape that scrutiny. It also requires Biden to explain why it took him so long to turn against such an obviously catastrophic policy.</p><p>Some former members of the Obama administration remain stuck in denial</p><p>This is preposterous excuse-making that isn’t fooling anyone. Trump inherited this policy from Obama, continued it, and then escalated it. If that’s not a “glide path,” what is it? What was “fundamentally different” about the Obama administration’s support for the Saudi coalition that distinguishes it so clearly from Trump’s? Trump has been an unabashed supporter of the Saudis in his public statements, but in practical terms the weapons sales and military assistance have been virtually identical. The current administration is more shameless in pushing Saudi propaganda, but the previous administration did plenty of that, too. The main difference seems to be that Obama administration officials were more likely to say privately that they knew the war would fail from the start, but for reasons known only to them they kept supporting it anyway. The Obama administration was also very well aware of the war crimes that U.S. support enabled, but just like the current administration they disingenuously claimed that U.S. support was making the Saudi coalition’s bombing campaign better.</p><p>Obama and other members of his administration have been given a pass for more than four years for their role in starting the disastrous policy of supporting the war on Yemen. The decision to back the Saudi coalition’s war was one of the worst policy decisions in decades, and Obama and his officials need to answer for it – by Daniel Larison</p><p><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/obama-and-the-war-on-yemen/">https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/obama-and-the-war-on-yemen/</a></p><p>referring to</p><p>(* B P)</p><p>Biden Confronted His Legacy On Saudi Arabia.

On Friday, a Saudi air force officer studying at the Naval Air Station Pensacola <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2019/12/07/pensacola-shooting-shooter-updates/">shot dead</a> three <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/08/us/pensacola-naval-station-shooting-victim/index.html">Americans</a> and wounded eight others. Instead of expressing outrage or vowing vengeance, or even waiting for all the facts to come in, Trump sounded as if he were auditioning for the job of press secretary at the Saudi Embassy. He <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1203030938663428103">conveyed</a> King Salman’s “sincere condolences” and his (highly questionable) assurances “that this person in no way shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people who love the American people.” Trump then <a href="https://twitter.com/yeh1a/status/1203416122474799104">told reporters</a> that the king “will take care of the families and loved ones of the victims.” </p><p>Sorry, but Americans don’t need blood money from the Saudis.

Trump spoke to Saudi Arabia's King and to its Crown Prince and said, "They are devastated by what took place in Pensacola. And I think they're going to help out the families very greatly."</p><p>Do this thought experiment: What if the Pensacola shooter wasn't a Saudi but instead a national of a country such as Yemen that is on the Trump "travel ban" list of seven largely Muslim-majority countries whose citizens are subject to "extreme vetting."</p><p>The Pensacola attack reminds us that Trump, even more than his predecessors, has gone all in with the Saudis, defending their controversial war in Yemen and blockade against Qatar and continuing to support the regime after a US-based journalist critical of the government was murdered in a Saudi consulate. Trump has been particularly consistent in defending Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS.</p><p>Subcontracting US policy to the Saudis</p><p>The Trump administration subsequently subordinated much of its Middle East policy to the Saudis. When the Saudis blockaded their gas-rich neighbor Qatar in June 2017 shortly after Trump had visited Saudi Arabia, Trump went along for the ride despite that fact that Qatar housed the key US military base that was coordinating the war against both ISIS and the Taliban.</p><p>President Trump immediately aligned himself with Saudi talking points about Qatar – by Peter Bergen</p><p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/10/opinions/trump-always-has-saudis-back-opinion-bergen/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/10/opinions/trump-always-has-saudis-back-opinion-bergen/index.html</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp9a USA-Iran Krise: Wachsende Spannungen am Golf / US-Iran crisis: Mounting tensions at the Gulf</span></h2><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Trump gegen die iranische Bevölkerung</strong></p><p>US-Sanktionen: Um „die unterdrückte Bevölkerung im Iran“ ginge es, sogar um die armen Menschen im Jemen... Nur eine weitere Seite aus dem Irak-Playbook, die Trump gegen den Iran spielt.</p><p>Gestern verhängte die Trump-Regierung neue unilaterale Sanktionen gegen den Iran; gegen Firmen, Personen und immaterielle Güter. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/11/us-slaps-sanctions-on-irans-biggest-airline-and-shipping-group.html">Im Fokus der Sanktionen</a> steht IRISL, die iranische Staatsreederei und deren chinesische Tochter E-Sail Shipping, doch allen voran die größte private Fluggesellschaft im Iran, Mahan Air. Drei Funktionäre der Airline wurden sanktioniert genau wie Dutzende Flugzeuge. Mahan Air wird seit längerem von den USA sanktioniert, 2011 im Zuge von „<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-sanctions/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-iran-airline-over-proliferation-idUSKBN1YF1RR">Anti-Terror-Sanktionen</a>“ gegen den Iran. Dieses Mal beschworen das US-Außen- und das -Finanzministerium die Executive Order 13382 aus 2005 herauf, den „War on Terror“-Jahren der Bush-Ära, die die „Proliferation von Massenvernichtungswaffen“ unter Strafe stellt.</p><p>Irans Präsident <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/11/us-slaps-sanctions-on-irans-biggest-airline-and-shipping-group.html">erklärte</a>, seine „Regierung ist entschlossen, [den Feind] zu besiegen, indem sie die amerikanischen Sanktionen umgeht“.</p><p>Ökonomischer Terrorismus aus dem White House</p><p>Die Sanktionen <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/475635-iran-sanctions-wmds-iraq/">richten</a> sich nur sekundär gegen Mahan Air selbst, und keineswegs gegen die Führung des Iran. Vielmehr sollen andere Länder aus Angst davor, mit einem vermeintlichen „Proliferator von Massenvernichtungswaffen“ zu kooperieren, dazu gedrängt werden, Lande- oder auch nur Überflugrechte für Mahan-Flieger zu canceln oder Ersatzteile für die Airline zu liefern – Sekundärsanktionen gegen alles und jeden also, der es wagt, mit dem Iran Geschäfte zu machen, wie US-Außenminister Mike Pompeo auch <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-sanctions/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-iran-airline-over-proliferation-idUSKBN1YF1RR">unverblümt einräumt</a>.</p><p>Zwar versichert Pompeo, die Sanktionen würden aus Solidarität mit dem „unterdrückten iranischen Volk“ verhängt, doch richten sie sich natürlich exakt gegen dieses „unterdrückte iranischen Volk“. „Die Amerikaner haben die iranischen Fluggesellschaften seit Jahrzehnten sanktioniert“, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/475598-washington-iran-mahar-air-sanctions/">kommentiert</a> Mohammad Marandi, Professor von der <em>University of Tehran</em>, „und sie wollen, dass das Fliegen für die Menschen gefährlicher wird“.

Das „iranische Regime“, so US-Finanzminister Mnuchin weiter, leiste „einen direkten Beitrag zur verheerenden humanitären Krise … im Jemen“.</p><p>Die Heuchelei und die moralische Verrohung in dieser Begründung sind nur schwer zu beschreiben. Es gibt halbwegs glaubhafte Berichte, dass der Iran in der Vergangenheit im kleinen Maße die Houthis mit Waffen beliefert hat, was ich an dieser Stelle keineswegs leugnen will – aber: Der Jemen ist historisch derart überschwemmt mit Waffen aller Art, dass die Houthis schlicht keinen Bedarf an einer massiven Aufrüstung aus dem Ausland haben (wie ich <a href="http://justicenow.de/2018-03-11/die-houthi-iran-connection/">hier</a> dargelegt habe). Doch nehmen wir des Argumentes willen eine Sekunde an, die US-Regierung hätte Recht und der Iran würde die Houthi-Rebellen massiv hochrüsten.</p><p>Können wir den Jemenkrieg kurz vom Kopf auf die Füße stellen? Die „verheerende humanitären Krise“ im Jemen, die Trump mit seinen Sanktionen beenden will, gibt es natürlich, es ist die „<a href="http://justicenow.de/2018-03-04/zwischen-cholera-und-hungersnot/">größte humanitäre Katastrophe der Welt</a>“ – doch wurde sie nicht von den Houthis hervorgerufen, sondern von der <a href="http://justicenow.de/2019-07-29/unterstuetzung-heisst-komplizenschaft/">aus dem Westen unterhaltenen</a> Saudi-Emirate-Koalition!</p><p>Wenn Trump, die „verheerende humanitären Krise“ im Jemen beenden will, kann er einfach aufhören, Waffen an die Koalition zu liefern.

Even more, it reflects Tehran’s unease toward the trajectory of Yemen’s peace process. Iran revealed additional disquiet with Saudi Arabia’s leadership role in Yemen’s peace process on November 6 when Tehran <a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2019/11/6/riyadh-peace-agreement-legitimises-saudi-occupation-in-yemen">condemned</a> the Riyadh Agreement between the Hadi government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC) as a deal that promotes the “Saudi occupation of Yemen.”</p><p>Iran’s desire to contain Saudi Arabia’s geopolitical influence explains the contradiction between its criticisms of Yemen’s tentative peace process and Tehran’s long-standing opposition to the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen. Iranian officials view the war in Yemen as a frontier of Saudi expansionism. They see a unilateral Saudi withdrawal spearheaded by intra-coalitional frictions as a preferable scenario to a Riyadh-led peace settlement.<sup>i</sup> As the Riyadh Agreement has eased intra-coalitional tensions, Iran views its military alliance with the Houthis as a low-cost, high-impact way to retaliate against Saudi Arabia. It wishes to maintain that lever as long as possible. </p><p>Iran’s desire to prevent a peace settlement conducted on Saudi Arabia’s terms is also reflected in its criticisms of the UN-backed negotiations chaired by British diplomat and Special Envoy Martin Griffiths. The UN’s continued adherence to UNSC Resolution 2216, which blames the Houthis for instigating the Yemeni civil war, is particularly concerning for Iranian policymakers. </p><p>Iran’s desire to prevent Saudi Arabia from unilaterally setting the terms of the peace process is clear. Yet, Tehran’s history of <a href="https://www.mehrnews.com/news/4778266/%D9%86%D9%85%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%84%D9%84-%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B4-%D9%85%D8%AB%D8%A8%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DB%8C%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%81%D8%A7-%D9%85%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D9%86%D8%AF#ref=translate">limited leverage</a> in Yemen and inability to invest in the country’s economic reconstruction process hinder its ability to protect its interests in Yemen. To overcome these shortcomings, Iran is offering diplomatic assistance to counter negative attention surrounding its support for the Houthis and ensure that its presence in Yemen gains some international acceptance.</p><p>Iranian policymakers have informally set two conditions for an acceptable power-sharing agreement in Yemen. First, Iran demands the inclusion of Houthis, either as an official member of Yemen’s governing coalition or as a potent military force operating outside state institutions.<sup>iii</sup> Second, Iran opposes any agreement that fundamentally changes Yemen’s constitutional structure or results in the country’s partition – by Samuel Ramani</p><p><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/80557">https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/80557</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp12a Katar-Krise / Qatar crisis</span></h2><p>(A P)</p><p>Qatar sees 'small progress' in resolving Gulf dispute, still believes in GCC</p><p>Asked whether there was progress at the meeting of regional leaders, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Reuters at the Doha Forum in Qatar that there has been “small progress, just a little progress”.</p><p>The premier’s visit followed an intensification of efforts to resolve the row including unannounced Qatar-Saudi talks in October.

Former President Omar al-Bashir, who was overthrown by the military coup in Sudan earlier this year, argued that Sudanese forces should take part in the Yemeni war at every opportunity possible to help their Saudi friends.</p><p>However, Sudanese Prime Minister Abdullah Hamdok said that he would recall Sudanese troops from the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, correctly asserting that</p><p>“There is no military solution to the conflict in Yemen, either from us or from the other side of the world. The problem needs to be solved by political means.”</p><p>This is part of Sudan’s efforts to normalize relations with the West by demonstrating it is a responsible country, with Hamdok even having talks with U.S. officials to discuss the process of removing Sudan’s name from the list of countries that support terrorism. Although Washington lifted the economic sanctions imposed on Sudan since 1997 in October 2017, they did not remove Sudan from the “list of countries supporting terrorism” that was imposed in 1993 for hosting al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.</p><p>The question then remains why Sudan is now withdrawing from Yemen. Sudan has now demonstrated that it wants to act to serve its own direct interests, in which it has none in Yemen. Hamdok has a clear vision for Sudan, that is becoming ever closer to the U.S. His vision for Sudan is to become a leading country in the region that yields significant influence, however, it appears Hamdok does not have much self-confidence and believes this can only be achieved by aligning with Washington.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/sudan-withdrawal-yemen-alignment-u-s/5697470">https://www.globalresearch.ca/sudan-withdrawal-yemen-alignment-u-s/5697470</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp13 Waffenhandel / Arms Trade</span></h2><p>Siehe / Look at cp1</p><p>(* A K P)</p><p>Waffenbauer wegen Jemen angezeigt</p><p>Im Jemen-Konflikt kommen auch Waffen deutscher Firmen zum Einsatz.

Security Council resolutions in exporting arms, which it's not allowed to do," said James Phillips, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington. </p><p>Although the size of the recently seized shipment remains unclear, experts charge that over the years, Iran has delivered a substantial amount of weaponry to its Houthi allies in response to what Tehran sees as growing Saudi Arabian influence in the country. "The weapon cache discovered in that yacht is only a small example of what IRGC Quds Force is sending to Yemen to be used by Houthi rebels," said Babak Taghvaei, a Malta-based military analyst with knowledge of Iran's involvement in regional conflicts, including the one in Yemen. </p><p>He told VOA that a Saudi-led coalition had on several occasions seized Iranian-made weapons that were intended for the Houthis. </p><p><a href="https://www.voanews.com/extremism-watch/analysts-seized-weapons-show-irans-deep-involvement-yemens-war">https://www.voanews.com/extremism-watch/analysts-seized-weapons-show-irans-deep-involvement-yemens-war</a></p><p>My comment: “Analysts” and “experts” sounds good, but it’s little more than propaganda.</p><p>(A P)</p><p>Peace in Yemen elusive one year on from Stockholm</p><p>Today, our disappointment is great because nothing has been achieved following any of the Swedish accords.
