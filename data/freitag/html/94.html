Nur selten erhalten westliche Journalisten Einblick.</p> <p>Der Krieg im Jemen hat viele Menschen vertrieben, die im eigenen Land Schutz suchen. Das Reporterteam reist in ein Lager, in dem Geflüchtete völlig auf sich alleine gestellt sind. Verletzt, krank, traumatisiert - sie alle suchen nach Worten und Antworten auf die Frage, wer die treibenden Kräfte des Krieges sind. Viele wissen es nicht. "Der Jemen ist elend, verwüstet und ein hoffnungsloser Fall", erzählt ein junger Jemenit, der sich und sein Land aufgegeben hat. Während ihrer Reise stoßen die Autoren aber auch auf Menschen wie die 12-jährige Noor, die sagt: "Ich will Architektin werden und mein Land wieder aufbauen."</p> <p>Die Dokumentation zeigt jedoch auch die komplizierte Ausgangslage des Konflikts. Die Hoffnung auf Frieden währt meist nur kurz: So waren durch Vermittlung der Vereinten Nationen mehrere Vereinbarungen zwischen den schiitischen Huthi-Rebellen, die vom Iran unterstützt werden, und der von Saudi-Arabien unterstützten jemenitischen Regierung ausgehandelt worden. Hoffnungen auf einen Waffenstillstand wurden geweckt - und mussten kurz darauf wegen neuer Kämpfe wieder begraben werden</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.zdf.de/politik/auslandsjournal/jemen--der-krieg-die-kinder-und-der-hunger-vom-31-januar-2019-100.htm">https://www.zdf.de/politik/auslandsjournal/jemen--der-krieg-die-kinder-und-der-hunger-vom-31-januar-2019-100.htm</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p> <p><strong>Films by Doctors Without Borders</strong></p> <p>Five days in a Yemeni Hospital Follow <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MSF?src=hash">#MSF</a></span> teams during their daily work in <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mocha?src=hash">#Mocha</a></span> <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a></span> A story we tell in five episodes on this week.</p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/msf_yemen/status/1089880525580484608">https://twitter.com/msf_yemen/status/1089880525580484608</a></span></p> <p>Five days in a Yemeni hospital - December 2018.

Yet Saudi sources claim that up to 920 civilians may have been killed, along with thousands injured and maimed, since 2014 (Masam, 2 January 2019; Arab News, 22 January 2019). Mine blasts have intensified since a coalition of Emirati-backed Yemeni forces started a military campaign in the western province of Hodeidah, which accounts for nearly 60% of total civilian deaths linked to mines planted by the Houthis in 2018 (ACLED, 6 June 2018). Mine incidents have gradually increased over the past year and culminated in December 2018 and January 2019, the deadliest months since ACLED started to record violent events in Yemen.</span></p> <p><span>A closer look at the data, however, could help explain the drivers behind this increase. Between January and May last year, Houthi-planted mines reportedly killed an average of three civilians each month in Hodeidah. After the Emirati-backed Yemeni forces launched the offensive, the figure jumped to twelve between June and December 2018, marking a significant 279% increase. The districts of At Tuhayat, Ad Durahyimi, Al Khawkhah, and Hays – all situated south of Hodeidah – account for more than 70% of the total mine incidents recorded across the province. This spike does not appear to be a mere by-product of flaring violence, but rather seems to replicate a pattern observed in Aden in 2015, when Houthi-Saleh forces retreating from the southern port city indiscriminately deployed thousands of anti-personnel and anti-tank landmines to obstruct the movement of troops (UN Security Council S/2016/73: 36).</span></p> <p><span>In addition to spreading insecurity, the pervasive use of explosive devices is also impairing economic activity. Landmines disseminated in grazing lands have frequently hit farmers and animals, which constitute the main source of livelihood for many families in rural areas (Masam, 12 December 2018). In the Red Sea, the Houthis have reportedly laid sea mines threatening commercial shipping and fishermen, who already face the constant threat of air strikes (Al Jazeera, 30 November 2018; New York Times, 17 December 2018). According to ACLED data, improvised sea mines have killed at least thirteen fishermen off the coast of Hodeidah since last July Map: infographic)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.acleddata.com/2019/01/30/how-houthi-planted-mines-are-killing-civilians-in-yemen/">https://www.acleddata.com/2019/01/30/how-houthi-planted-mines-are-killing-civilians-in-yemen/</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>H1N1 flu infects 107 people in capital Sanaa since beginning of this year</p> <p>The Public Health and Population Bureau of the capital Sana'a on Monday has recorded 107 swine flu cases since the beginning of this year.<br /> 107 people were infected with H1N1 flu, of which 22 people died from the disease since the beginning of 2019, the Director of the Health Bureau in the capital Sanaa, Dr. Mutahar al-Marouni told Saba.<br /> Al-Marouni pointed out that reports of injuries and deaths are received from all hospitals and government and private centers operating in the Secretariat.<br /> He pointed out that there is a shortage of medicines because of the siege imposed by the Saudi-led coalition on all land, sea and air ports.</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news524810.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news524810.htm</a></span></p> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>After Cholera outbreak in <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a></span>, there is Another epidemic affected people in <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a></span> H1N1 alot of H1N1 patients arrive Sana'a hospitals and #<span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a></span> on daily basis &amp; there is no good treatment to care of those patients.

The parties to conflict in Yemen like to pin the blame on UN officials when peace efforts falter. They say the UN is biased, or that UN officials have suspicious agendas. This leads in turn to a lack of cooperation and ballooning distrust.</p> <p>This month, the Houthis <a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2019/1/13/yemens-houthis-boycott-meeting-with-un-led-truce-monitors">boycotted a meeting</a> with the head of the UN monitoring team, expressing their doubt towards his role, and heightening tensions around it. But the fact of the matter is that the problem does not lie solely in the UN monitors or envoys. It lies in Yemen's warring sides and their conflicting interpretations and understandings of peace agreements. This is a crisis of trust. </p> <p>The Houthis protested the role of Cammaert in Hodeida, calling on UN envoy Martin Griffiths to step in. So, will the new head of the monitoring team be able please the Houthis and their opponents alike? This is an arduous job.</p> <p>If the two sides, particularly the Houthis, persist behaving in this way, no UN envoys or monitors will be able to help Yemen reach any peace agreement. Moreover, the UN will go on playing a feeble role so long as punitive measures are not taken against any party that purposefully obstructs the peace process in Yemen. </p> <p>If and when, the UN changes its flimsy rhetoric, and when it adopts a strict plan B agreement where violations occur, peace can be possible. Yet if it continues its lax stances and ineffective resolutions, the cycle of the civil conflict will not cease.</p> <p>Yemenis seem to have abandoned the idea that the UN has the capability to pressure the warring sides into stopping the atrocities in the country. Accordingly, the replacement of the head of the monitoring mission is effectively meaningless for multitudes of Yemenis.</p> <p><span>While the UN seems to understand the dangers associated with the fighting in the city, the parties to the conflict appear willing to risk going to war as the solution. </span></p> <p><span>The time is now ripe for better UN policies for dealing with the conflict in Yemen. Monitors and envoys alone will not help, unless they are accompanied by unequivocal international support for making all UN resolutions a living reality in Yemen.</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2019/1/30/un-monitors-alone-cannot-establish-peace-in-yemen">https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2019/1/30/un-monitors-alone-cannot-establish-peace-in-yemen</a> </span></p> <p><span>(A K pH)</span></p> <p>2 women injured in saudi-led mercenaries' bombardment at Hodeidah</p> <p>Two women were injured on Wednesday when the mercenaries of US-backed saudi-led aggression coalition-fired their artillery's shells at Hodeidah province, an official said.<br /> The shelling targeted residential areas of Durihimi district.<br /> Furthermore, the enemy shelled seperate areas in Kilo -16 of Haly.</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news525081.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news525081.htm</a> </span></p> <p><span>(A K pH)</span></p> <p>Saudi-led mercenaries bombard areas in Hodeida</p> <p>The shelling hit the areas of July 7 and Kilo 16 and led to heavy damage</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news525094.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news525094.htm</a> </span></p> <p><span>(* A K pH)</span></p> <p><span>S</span>audi-led mercenaries commit 248 violations to Hodeidah cease-fire over 72 last hours</p> <p>The Saudi-led coalition and theirs mercenaries have committed 248 violations of UN-brokered cease-fire in Hodeidah over the past 72 hours, said the army spokesman Yahya Sarie on Wednesday said in a statement.<br /> “The violations included artillery and missile attacks, as well as 15 airstrikes on houses and farms of the citizens in districts of Hodeidah,” Sarie said.</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news525093.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news525093.htm</a> </span></p> <p><span>(A K P)</span></p> <p>Saudi-led coalition ready to use 'calibrated force' to push Yemen port deal: UAE</p> <p><span>The Saudi-led coalition is prepared to use “calibrated force” to push the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement to withdraw from Yemen’s Hodeidah port city under a U.N.-sponsored deal, a senior United Arab Emirates official said on Wednesday.</span></p> <p><span>Yemen’s warring parties have failed to pull troops from the country’s main port under a month-old truce, reviving the threat of an all-out assault on Hodeidah that could unleash famine.</span></p> <p>Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said the Western-backed Sunni Muslim Arab coalition struck 10 Houthi training camps outside Hodeidah governorate on Wednesday.</p> <p>“Coalition prepared to use more calibrated force to prod Houthi compliance with Stockholm Agreement,” he tweeted.</p> <p>“To preserve ceasefire &amp; any hope for political process, UN and international community must press Houthis to stop violations, facilitate aid convoys, and move forward on withdrawal from Hodaida city &amp; ports as agreed,” he added.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/saudi-led-coalition-ready-to-use-calibrated-force-to-push-yemen-port-deal-uae-idUSKCN1PO2RQ">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/saudi-led-coalition-ready-to-use-calibrated-force-to-push-yemen-port-deal-uae-idUSKCN1PO2RQ</a></span></p> <p><span>and also </span><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-led-coalition-threatens-force-against-houthis-amid-un-backed-prisoner-swap-1329535263">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-led-coalition-threatens-force-against-houthis-amid-un-backed-prisoner-swap-1329535263</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: The UAE tries to justify in advance that they will reinforce their assault against Hodeidah – which they had stopped quite unwillingly and only urged by the UN and their Western backers. – “Calibrated force”: You first really must conceive this Orwellian wording.

Many analysts see this as Saudi Arabia at war with its arch-rival, Iran. A proxy war between the two regional powers, whose animosity with each other goes back decades. Saudi Arabia is carrying out this economic warfare in Yemen, with the express backing of the Yemeni government. Yemen is being attacked by air and sea, courtesy of Saudi Arabia, with the aim of destroying its economy and stifling every point of entry into the country. This includes the blockade of the major port on the Red Sea, which is the main route used for aid and humanitarian assistance into Yemen.</span></p> <p><span>The obvious question is why has Saudi Arabia involved itself in a conflict that began as an internal Yemeni dispute? Saudi Arabia’s justifies its involvement in the conflict by saying Houthi rebels attacked them and they are responding to this aggression, while at the same time providing assistance to which they see as the legitimate government of Yemen. The Saudis have also said, and have been saying, that victory for them is around the corner. So far victory has been seen for neither the Saudis nor the Houthi rebels.</span></p> <p>America and other Western countries have kept silent and allowed the Saudis to do as they please — damn the human rights violations and the dying children.</p> <p>Why then has it taken so long for Western powers to talk about Yemen? Because to talk about Saudi Arabia and its royal family’s actions does not suit anyone’s interest.</p> <p>There has also been a shift in Western media reporting of the conflict — more of it, more focused, more critical of the Saudis. And of the Americans for their silence. This deserved increased media attention on Yemen has shown us the extent of the misery of Yemen’s children</p> <p>However, even though the conflict has been in the limelight recently, with superpowers like America and regional powers like Saudi Arabia involved — not to mention the arms industry and its vast profits — the war in Yemen is much bigger than us. We are removed from it for far greater reasons then just geography. It is also difficult to see that countries, particularly Western countries, who profess to be beacons of human rights, will actually demand an end to the war or to go as far as hold Saudi Arabia accountable. With the veto power at the UN, it is difficult to see even the UN being able to hold powerful nations to account on this. </p> <p>Progress then is certainly a relative word for onlookers and laypersons. For those of us not in positions of power or influence, for the sake of the children of Yemen, we must ask ourselves whether we really are too insignificant to say or do anything? People power, which has shown to be effective in many parts of the world, should demand the end of this horrific conflict. Everyone must have a way to register their protest and use social media as a collective, global voice to protest. People everywhere must speak truth to power and put pressure on their elected representatives that the war, even when far away from their shores and daily lives, must end, and end now. Nations, no matter how small, also have a moral consciousness and they must exercise it — in bilateral discussions and at larger multilateral forums.

Es wird Arabisch/Deutsch gedolmetscht.</p> <p>Wir möchten beim Auftakt erstmals beraten, wie diese Allianz sich formieren und Einfluss nehmen kann, nachdem die internationale Lage zu Jemen und die für die Menschen im Jemen nicht weiter kommt.Vielen aus der Zivilgesellschaft in Jemen, hier und in Nachbarländern, liegt es sehr am Herzen, etwas zu tun. Sicher wird man sich weiter an die Internationale Gemeinschaft wenden und appellieren. Dennoch scheint die Situation wie eingefroren. Auch die Stockholmer Vereinbarung (13. Dez. 2018) verändert nichts. Alle Argumente und das Dringlichste wie Informationen über das Elend der Menschen in Jemen sind bekannt und ausgetauscht. Humanitäre Organisationen aus Yemen, aus dem Ausland und die Hilfswerke der Vereinten Nationen warten auf einen Waffenstillstand: Nahrung, Medizin, das Nötigste muss zunächst ins Land. Danach könnte ein Aufbau beginnen, die Schulen geöffnet werden, Krankheiten geheilt werden, das Leben beginnen.</p> <p>Nur durch eine gemeinsame Allianz der Zivilgesellschaft könnte Bewegung ins Spiel kommen. </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.peace-for-yemen-now.de/">https://www.peace-for-yemen-now.de/</a></span></p> <p><span>Bemerkung: Hatte am 29.

That’s an average of more than 2,000 children every single day since June last year. And that’s only from Hodeidah, which has seen some of the worst fighting in Yemen.</p> <p>Civilians fleeing violence face life-threatening risks the moment they embark on their journeys. The most immediate danger is death or injury due to explosive weapons which have been used indiscriminately by all parties to the conflict with little regard for their legal obligation to protect civilians in conflict.</p> <p>On August 23rd last year, <a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/2757939">22 children</a> and four women were reportedly killed when an airstrike hit their vehicle as they were trying to flee the fighting in Hodeidah. More recently, at least <a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/2967139">eight civilians were killed</a> in a centre for displaced families in Hajjah, apparently due to shrapnel from shelling nearby. Monitoring group <a href="https://www.acleddata.com/data/">ACLED</a> recorded at least 25 attacks against internally displaced people in just the second half of 2018.</p> <p>If displaced families manage to survive their dangerous journeys and avoid airstrikes and shelling to reach relative safety, they face further difficulties in strained host communities or in camps lacking in adequate food supplies and basic sanitation and hygiene. This puts young children at risk of malnutrition and disease in a country where the health system has all but collapsed and some 14 million people are on the brink of starvation.

More than 14 million are facing starvation, and 85,000 children may have already died from extreme hunger since the war began in 2015. With key ports closed or blockaded, vital food, medicine and humanitarian aid is unable to reach ordinary people, who are now in desperate need. Aid workers are reporting that parents are being forced to feed their children contaminated food and water, or nothing at all.</p> <p>The conflict, now entering its fourth year, has forced millions of people to flee their homes. Many describe running through the night to escape bombings with nothing more than the clothes on their backs. Most people head to ‘safer’ coastal towns and the southern port city of Aden where there is some hope of accessing food supplies. Families are setting up makeshift homes wherever they can find available land – in the desert, on garbage dumps and in abandoned buildings.</p> <p>Tallabah Ali, a widow who fled bombing in the darkness of night, now lives with her family in a flimsy tent in the middle of a graveyard in Taiz, the only space available to them. Despite failing eyesight and difficulty walking, she goes out begging for food every day.</p> <p>“It’s not easy to lose your dignity and resort to begging” she said, “but if I don’t, my family will die from hunger.” “I feel ashamed to say that begging has become our main source of income.”</p> <p>Tallabah describes the chaos of the night she fled her home <em>“we were surrounded in all directions…the bullets were chasing us”</em> she said. But today she’d rather return home than live as a beggar: <em>“It was the worse day of my life when I left my house… but life under battles is better than hunger and suffering in this camp. I hope to return to my home as soon as possible”.</em> She intends to try once the road to her village has reopened.</p> <p>Her thoughts are echoed by Habiba, Rafi’s mother: <em>“The worst decision we ever made in our life was leaving home. There we would be killed only once; here we are dying a hundred times,”</em> she said.</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/urgent-action-needed-help-millions-yemenis-facing-starvation">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/urgent-action-needed-help-millions-yemenis-facing-starvation</a> </span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p>Yemen: the young women and men behind the headlines</p> <p>Millions in need of humanitarian assistance</p> <p>Since the war started in Yemen in 2015, three million people have been displaced and <a href="https://www.unocha.org/yemen/about-ocha-yemen">an estimated 22.2 million people</a> are in need of humanitarian or protection assistance.</p> <p>It has been six years since I was last in Yemen. </p> <p>I often remember the young people I met there and was afraid to think what might have happened to them – but a couple of weeks ago, I reached out to one of the youths I had the privilege of working with back in Aden.</p> <p>He reluctantly mentioned that some of the young people I knew are no longer with us – then after a short pause, he continued: ‘but many of them are now in the front lines, saving lives and helping people.’</p> <p><span><a href="https://plan-uk.org/blogs/yemen-the-young-women-and-men-behind-the-headlines">https://plan-uk.org/blogs/yemen-the-young-women-and-men-behind-the-headlines</a> </span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p><span>Coldness in Yemen capital Sana'a hitting the lowest temperature level since December (image9</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/Shuaibalmosawa/status/1090736789764128768">https://twitter.com/Shuaibalmosawa/status/1090736789764128768</a></span></p> <p>Thousands of families across <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a></span> suffer the bitter winter cold with little to no protection, another hardship that the average Yemeni is forced to endure</p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/YemenSource/status/1090771135770382336">https://twitter.com/YemenSource/status/1090771135770382336</a></span></p> <p><span>Film: IDPs in #Yemen suffered severe cold-weather conditions this winter. #Peace could bring warmth to hundred thousands of families shattered across IDP settlements all over the country.

Some 67 percent (20 million people) of the country’s total population of 29.9 million would be in need of urgent assistance to save their lives and livelihoods. The ongoing conflict has led to a severe economic decline and collapsed essential services, taking an enormous toll on the population and exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. The expansion of the conflict has also led to large-scale displacement of 3.3 million people and high rates of malnutrition. Malnutrition is affecting 3 million people including 1.5 million children, 1.1 million pregnant and lactating women, and 400 000 acutely malnourished children. The agriculture sector is among the worst hit by the current crisis and local food production has been severely compromised.</p> <p>Conflict and insecurity remain the main drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition that have pushed the most vulnerable households to the brink of famine. They include a significant loss of income and disrupted livelihoods, huge population displacement, restricted access, shrinking imports and continuing depreciation of the Yemeni Rial, which deepens the currency and economic crisis.</p> <p>Preventing the country from slipping into famine requires a significant political and economic engagement at all levels from all sides on finding peaceful solutions to end the <span><a href="http://www.fao.org/emergencies/emergency-types/conflicts/en/">conflict</a></span> and an immediate cessation of hostilities. It also requires immediate high impact programmes to bolster and revive disrupted livelihoods for vulnerable rural communities. The Famine Prevention Plan, which is within the framework of the Yemen Famine Prevention Roadmap and the Yemen Famine Prevention Strategy, is just one of the actions that need to be implemented by stakeholders to prevent famine from occurring in the country.</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-famine-prevention-plan-january-june-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-famine-prevention-plan-january-june-2019</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p>Yemen faces population explosion 'time bomb'</p> <p>A population growth rate that is one of the highest in the world is hampering efforts to combat poverty and unemployment.</p> <p>Yemen is facing a security threat, described by one expert as a "time bomb". It is not al Qa'eda, the Houthi rebellion in the north or the secessionist movement in the south, though its influence cuts across all three.</p> <p>It is found in millions of households across the country,</p> <p>High population growth rates are often associated with developing countries, and the ensuing youth bulge is often blamed as a factor in social instability. But when a country is suffering from a natural resource crunch and faltering economic growth, not to mention three internal conflicts, the picture becomes alarming. "If the government doesn't do something, there will be a disaster," said Himyar Abdulmoghni of the United Nations Population Fund in Sana'a.</p> <p>According to the NPC, if population growth remains unchecked, the ailing economy, with an unemployment rate of around 40 per cent, will have to create more than 2.2 million jobs in the next 25 years. The country will need an extra five billion cubic metres of water - which it does not have - and to maintain already patchy health services it will have to train and employ an extra 10,000 doctors.</p> <p>The pressure of rising population levels, which have tripled since 1975, is already being felt in areas such as education, where there is reportedly one teacher for every 80 children, and transport. Abdo Seif, a development specialist with the United Nations Development Programme, said population growth was the most critical problem facing Yemen. "It's the root cause of other problems," he said. Youth unemployment, exacerbated by the entry of several hundred thousand people in to the labour market every year, is widely believed to be an underlying cause of civil unrest in both the north and south of Yemen.</p> <p>The international community is particularly concerned that the lack of economic opportunities is making young people vulnerable to radicalisation. Youth unemployment "is a security threat," Mr Seif said. </p> <p><span>The government has started to tackle the problem, and began to promote family planning in 2005, hoping to cut the population growth from its current level of three per cent to 2.2 per cent in 2025. However, the assistant secretary general of the National Population Council, Motahar Ahmed Zabarah, said they were unlikely to meet that target, and instead have settled for 2.5 per cent. The problem is partly one of resources. For a cash-strapped government struggling with so many immediate concerns, there is a difference between recognising something as an issue to be dealt with and allocating a budget to it, Mr Zabarah said.</span></p> <p>According to the UN population fund, the number of 10 to 25-year-olds will rise from 8.6 million to 20.8 million in the next 25 years if nothing is done to curb growth. It is not clear where these young people will live, how they will be fed, watered, educated and employed; or how they will be prevented from discontent, rioting, forming gangs and joining armed insurgencies. If the national family planning policy fails to make any change, Yemen will soon find out.</p> <p><span>Another obstacle, he said, is a lack of available contraceptives and family planning services in rural areas – by Abigail Fielding-Smith</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/yemen-faces-population-explosion-time-bomb-1.510447">https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/yemen-faces-population-explosion-time-bomb-1.510447</a></span></p> <p><span>Remark: Published by an Emirati media, but by a Western author.</span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p><span>Film: </span>With Saudi Coalition attacking hospitals and civilians, Children in Yemen cannot get the medication they need</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/YemenNotAlone/videos/vb.339499086619796/548206485699818/">https://www.facebook.com/YemenNotAlone/videos/vb.339499086619796/548206485699818/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span>6,700 children killed, injured in Yemen: UNICEF</span></p> <p>Thousands of children have been killed and injured in war-torn conflict since 2015, UN children’s fund (UNICEF) said on Wednesday. </p> <p>“Over 6,700 children [were] verified killed or injured since 2015,” UNICEF said on Twitter. </p> <p>It said nearly 358,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition require immediate treatment, going on to call for halting attacks in the war-torn country. </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/6-700-children-killed-injured-in-yemen-unicef/1379209">https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/6-700-children-killed-injured-in-yemen-unicef/1379209</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: Severe understatement, coming close to whitewashing the actors.</span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p>Director of National Authority for Humanitarian Affairs: Over 225,000 Families in Sana’a Need Food</p> <p>The humanitarian situation is worsening to a real humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen, the director of National Authority for Humanitarian Affairs in capital Sana’a, Abdul Wahab Sharaf Al-Din warns.</p> <p>According to Yemen Press Agency, Sharaf Al-Din said that the World Food Program targets 83,000 households monthly, and that the proportion of the humanitarian need for food reached 65% , which is over than 225,000 families in the capital Sana’a.</p> <p>Sharaf Al-Din indicated that the poor international deal with the humanitarian file in Yemen seriously threatens the humanitarian situation, and can not be prevented or controlled at all.</p> <p>He explained that the humanitarian intervention in Yemen did not rise to the level and magnitude of the food disaster which the Yemeni people suffered, that needs an emergency and rapid response, according to UN reports.</p> <p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=5154">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=5154</a></span></p> <p><span>Remark: Sanaa government authority.</span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span>WFP warnt vor Verschärfung der Lage im Jemen</span></p> <p><span>Das Welternährungsprogramm UN World Food Programme, WFP, warnt vor einer Hungersnot und Verschlechterung der humanitären Lage im Jemen.</span></p> <p><span><a href="http://parstoday.com/de/news/middle_east-i45769-wfp_warnt_vor_versch%C3%A4rfung_der_lage_im_jemen">http://parstoday.com/de/news/middle_east-i45769-wfp_warnt_vor_versch%C3%A4rfung_der_lage_im_jemen</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H K)</span></p> <p><span>Film von Ärzte ohne Grenzen: </span>Landminen im Jemen sorgen für tägliche Angst</p> <p>Amarah spielte auf einem Feld, auf dem Landminen versteckt waren.

Der bewaffnete Konflikt hat ein ohnehin schon armes Land hart getroffen. Eine wirtschaftliche Talfahrt, die speziell die Währung enorm an Wert verlieren ließ, der Zusammenbruch staatlicher Institutionen, die Blockade der Häfen und Zugangswege sind nur einige Gründe, warum sich die humanitäre Lage trotz enormer Anstrengung von Hilfsorganisationen weiter verschärft. Neue Studien der Vereinten Nationen gehen davon aus, dass in diesem Jahr mehr als 24 Millionen Menschen humanitäre Hilfe benötigen. Das sind 80 Prozent der Bevölkerung und eine Steigerung um 10 Prozent im Vergleich zum letzten Jahr. Und mehr als 15 Millionen Menschen sind von einer Hungersnot bedroht.</p> <p>Viele Menschen wissen nicht, wo sie das Essen für den nächsten Tag herbekommen sollen, nehmen deshalb nur eine Mahlzeit täglich zu sich oder essen nur alle paar Tage etwas.

Obwohl sich die Zahlen der neuen Infektionen verringert, ist die Gefahr an Cholera zu erkranken immer noch hoch. Das gilt besonders in abgelegenen Gebieten, wo die Versorgung mit sauberem Trinkwasser wegen Bombenangriffen oder durch fehlende Wartung von Brunnen oder Leitungen nicht mehr gewährleistet werden kann.</p> <p>Viele Menschen im Jemen könnten ohne humanitäre Hilfe nicht überleben.

Julian, ACTED country director, reports on the humanitarian situation in an interview in January 2019.</span></p> <p><span>Yemen is the worst humanitarian disaster in contemporary history. The armed conflict has hit an already poor country hard. The slowdown in economic activity,—which has led to a considerable decline in the value of the currency—the collapse of State institutions, the bureaucracy of the parties to the conflict— several of whom have delayed projects for several months— are just some of the reasons why the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate despite the enormous efforts of humanitarian organizations. The United Nations estimates in its “Overview of Humanitarian Needs for 2019” that more than 24 million people will require humanitarian assistance. This represents 80% of the population and a 10% increase compared to 2018.</span></p> <p><span>The most important needs are in the area of food security. According to a study, more than 15 million people are threatened by famine. Many people do not know where to get food for tomorrow and therefore eat only one meal a day. There is enough food almost everywhere in Yemen, so the problem is not availability. The problem is that people can no longer afford to eat for many reasons. For example, civil servants’ salaries have not been paid at all for years, or have been paid with large deductions, so even the former middle class no longer has the means to feed itself.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to food security, drinking water is scarce in many places. Years of war have destroyed vital infrastructure. The lack of clean drinking water led to the worst cholera outbreak ever measured in the country in late 2017. Although the number of new infections is decreasing, the risk of cholera remains high. This is particularly true in remote areas where drinking water supplies can no longer be guaranteed due to bomb attacks or lack of infrastructure maintenance.</span></p> <p>In Yemen, a very large part of the population depends on humanitarian aid as their only source of food. The World Food Programme (WFP) provides food rations to nearly 10 million people every month. The terrible thing about this situation is that, in other crises around the world, people often have their own reserves in addition to WFP rations. Their dependence on rations is limited in time. In Yemen, millions of people have depended on food for survival for years. But rations are not designed for this and people who live on food rations alone have exhausted their fat reserves by the second year at the latest and suffer from severe pain due to poor nutrition.</p> <p>International NGOs like ACTED are trying to help people meet their basic needs through cash transfer programmes. ACTED and Welthungerhilfe provide financial support to the people of Yemen.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.acted.org/en/current-situation-in-yemen/">https://www.acted.org/en/current-situation-in-yemen/</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-more-15-million-people-are-threatened-famine">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-more-15-million-people-are-threatened-famine</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span>UN Children's Fund: </span>Humanitarian Action for Children 2019 - Yemen</p> <p><span>The conflict-driven humanitarian crisis in Yemen has been described as the largest emergency in the world, with more than 22 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.</span></p> <p>UNICEF’s strategy in Yemen is informed by the humanitarian needs overview, the humanitarian response plan, cluster strategies and programme priorities.8 UNICEF’s humanitarian operations are decentralized, with five field offices managing interventions locally with partners. With the collapse of public services, UNICEF will focus on improving access to primary health care by providing supplies and responding to communicable disease outbreaks. Community prevention and management of malnutrition will remain essential components of the response.<br /> The water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programme will support the rehabilitation and sustainability of local water management systems to increase access to safe water. AWD/cholera prevention and response will focus on high-risk areas, including through the provision of oral cholera vaccines.9 Vulnerable children will be targeted with victim assistance, education on mines/explosive remnants of war and resilience building. UNICEF will continue to rehabilitate damaged schools, establish temporary safe learning spaces and provide learning/pedagogical kits for conducive learning environments for children. School-based staff will receive incentives to ensure education for children.10 The shifting humanitarian context requires a flexible response strategy aimed at reaching people in need regardless of their location.<br /> The multisectoral Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) will be leveraged to assist newly displaced families and respond to immediate needs.</p> <p>As of 31 October 2018, UNICEF had US$479.7 million available against the revised appeal of US$423.9 million (100 per cent funded).11 This enabled UNICEF to immediately respond to the AWD/cholera outbreak through an integrated nutrition, health, WASH and communication for development plan.<br /> Some 4.9 million people accessed safe drinking water and 9.5 million people engaged in awareness and behaviour change activities. Health facilities received supplies and operational support. More than 4.1 million children were vaccinated against polio with UNICEF support, and over 1 million children under 5 years received primary health care.<br /> In addition, more than 229,000 children with SAM received treatment. UNICEF’s child protection programme reached more than 625,000 children with psychosocial support in child-friendly spaces, and some 1.3 million children and adults with risk education on mines/explosive remnants of war. Ninety-one per cent of reported incidents of grave violations against children were verified and documented through the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism. With UNICEF support, 41,700 school bags were distributed to schoolchildren, and some 157,400 children accessed education services in safe learning spaces.<br /> Psychosocial support services in schools benefited more than 133,000 students. UNICEF has been mobilizing resources for teacher incentives in order to resume the school year nationwide.</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/humanitarian-action-children-2019-yemen">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/humanitarian-action-children-2019-yemen</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/unicef">UN Children's Fund</a></span>: UNICEF Yemen Humanitarian Situation Report (December 2018)</p> <p><span>Almost four years of conflict, Yemen faces one of the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The escalation of conflict and violence has led to economic collapse, a destruction of basic services, pushed more families into poverty and into famine. With no end in sight to the conflict, the economic crisis, disease and displacement, the situation of Yemeni children and families is set to worsen, with an anticipated 24 million people (80 per cent of the population) in need of humanitarian assistance and protection and an estimated 3.9 million people who have been displaced since the conflict.</span></p> <p><span>The country is currently facing one of the largest food crisis in the world, rendering food and nutritional support one of the main humanitarian priorities. Going into the new year, 18 million people are food insecure, including 8.4 million who suffer from extreme hunger. Seven million Yemeni’s are malnourished, including almost two million children and more than one million pregnant and lactating women. This builds on the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis publicized in December 2018, which noted that 17 per cent of the population (about 5 million people) analyzed will be in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and 36 per cent (about 10.8 million people) will be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). In terms of severity, the worst affected areas are in Al Hudaydah, Amran, Hajjah, Taiz and Saada Governorates.</span></p> <p><span>UNICEF and other humanitarian actors are making every effort to avoid famine and increase assistance. To this end, UNICEF has accelerated the creation of specialized programmes to prevent and treat severe acute malnutrition in children in existing health facilities and using Mobile Teams to access hard-to-reach areas. UNICEF also provides essential supplies including for example ready to use therapeutic foods, antibiotics and therapeutic milk.</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unicef-yemen-humanitarian-situation-report-december-2018">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unicef-yemen-humanitarian-situation-report-december-2018</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span>Save the Children: MOURNING LOST CHILDREN: STORIES FROM YEMEN</span></p> <p><span>My name is Claire Nicoll and I work for the Humanitarian Operations Team at Save the Children. This summer, I lived and worked in Yemen. During my time there, I met many children, mothers and fathers whose stories stuck with me. Here is one of them.</span></p> <p>HAJJAH, YEMEN – 23<sup>RD</sup> AUGUST</p> <p>I’ve spoken to so many mothers mourning their lost children, that their stories have become a sad hallmark of my time in Yemen.</p> <p>Today I met Amal, whose three-year-old son, Ahmed, died of tonsillitis because the local health facility had run out of basic antibiotics. She spent a week’s worth of money on the bus fare to the hospital, and while she was trying to scrape together the money to go to a different health facility, Ahmed died.</p> <p>Amal said that she feels angry at her son’s fate and cheated out of the future he should have had.<em>“</em>I had to watch my child die in front of my eyes and there was nothing I could do. He deserved a future.”</p> <p>I’ve lost count of the number of similar stories I’ve heard, where parents can’t take their sick children to hospital in time because the transport costs are just too high.</p> <p>In the car on the way back from the health facility where I met Amal, I tried to comfort myself with the knowledge that Save the Children runs more than a hundred health facilities across the country. As much as we can, we try to be there with free healthcare to families who desperately need it. We also pay transport costs to help families reach hospitals in time. For many families, it’s literally a matter of life and death.</p> <p>But I can’t stop thinking about the children who aren’t so lucky, like Ahmed who died at home, in pain and from entirely preventable causes. Amal did everything she possibly could to save her son, but there were just too many obstacles stacked against her.</p> <p>She said the only thing she could do for her son was hold him in his final moments.</p> <p>A CRIPPLED HEALTH SYSTEM</p> <p>Ahmed is not an isolated case, and even those who do make it to public hospitals can be told on arrival that they have to pay for medicines and treatment, or even bring their own. This isn’t possible for many families and they leave empty handed, forced to take their children home – often to die.</p> <p>Half of all health facilities in Yemen are closed, and those that are still open lack vital life-saving medicines, specialist staff, even electricity. I saw pharmacies with near-empty shelves, staffed by exhausted doctors who said they simply don’t have the medicines they need to keep children alive any more: “How can we treat a missing limb with a plaster?”</p> <p>In many health centres incubators for premature and malnourished babies are missing essential parts – so staff are forced to make-do with whatever they can find, like plastic sheeting to help cover the incubator and prevent babies from being infected by germs.</p> <p>HEALTH FACILITY UNDER ATTACK</p> <p>Many hospitals are out of action because they’ve been destroyed in the fighting or are occupied by fighters.</p> <p>So why am I still here? Why do we all keep working day and night, when it can feel like all we do is put plasters on gaping wounds? It is because children like Ahmed could have been saved, and parents like Amal could be spared unimaginable heartbreak. And even though many more will die as long as the conflict grinds on, one child’s life alone is worth all of our time – by Claire Nicoll</p> <p><span><a href="https://blogs.savethechildren.org.uk/2019/01/mourning-children-stories-yemen">https://blogs.savethechildren.org.uk/2019/01/mourning-children-stories-yemen</a></span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p>Yemeni pet shop survives despite the odds</p> <p>In Yemen, where almost four years of war have brought millions to the brink of famine and ravaged the economy, Mourad Jamal struggles to keep his small pet shop in the capital Sanaa afloat.</p> <p>Fluffy white cats and birds are on show in cages along the wall.

We follow the stations and take samples of water periodically so that the water is not contaminated," Abdullah explains.</p> <p>The team of 120 workers employees starts the day very early with visits to Al-Kawather water stations as a part of their work duties where the campaign is targeting over 400 stations across the five governorates. Their main job is to ensure that the facilities are in compliance with sanitary conditions, water hygiene, and packaging.</p> <p>The group also pays close attention to the requirements used to sterilize water and for this, they have at hand tools that use ultraviolet radiation and various types of filters to monitor the quality of the water. Also, they help the owners of these stations to develop and ensure access to clean water to all customers and gain their confidence.</p> <p>Based on the last quality report from the National Water Resources Authority, the Water Stations improved on all the targeted indicators with an increase of more than 30 per cent comparing that to the to the start of the monitoring campaign.

John would whisper something, and the Emirati would question Salvatore.</p> <p>Once the questions ended, rougher treatment began. The Emirati interrogator, Salvatore would hear while blindfolded, would call out to colleagues by nicknames “and tell them what to do.” One of those colleagues was known by the nickname Hitler.</p> <p>Hitler would “electrify me,” Salvatore said. “They would strip me naked, they would beat me very harshly and slowly you start to understand the dynamics in the room. These are the two people, one of them is overseeing the whole interrogation”—by which Salvatore meant John, the presumed American—“and the other is doing the questioning and ordering the torture.”</p> <p>Salvatore’s account is fragmentary, as is that of another ex-detainee interviewed by The Daily Beast named Adel Salem Nasser al-Hasani, who gave similar accounts of a U.S. presence in Yemeni torture prisons based on what he saw—victims weren’t always blindfolded—heard, and heard other prisoners say. You don’t have to take these two former detainees’ word for it, however: The U.S. military now admits that American troops are in the facilities. But Salvatore and al-Hasani’s accounts also challenge the official U.S. position, which is that despite American service-members being present in Yemeni prisons, the U.S. doesn’t know anything about any torture that happens in detention centers run by U.S. allies.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/detainees-describe-an-american-presence-in-their-torture-chambers">https://www.thedailybeast.com/detainees-describe-an-american-presence-in-their-torture-chambers</a></span></p> <p>Remark: There hads been a lot of reporting on this matter.

They are now having power and an defend their options. <br /> Saleh added: “The southern cause now has a rightful political representative, that is the southern transitional council that managed to impose the cause on all international fields. It is no longer and internal affair as Sanaa regimen is trying to put it to the world. The southern support to the legitimacy and the Arab Coalition was only to face Al-Houthi project. But this doesn’t mean to accept any projects that deny the southern people their right in self-determination. The Yemeni legitimacy should recognize that its existence in Aden is only for helping Yemen to defeat Al-Houthi project and in appreciation of the Arab coalition’s role. But certainly, it doesn’t mean to accept any projects the legitimacy is trying to establish”. <br /> He indicated that the southern refused to participate in the Yemeni dialogue as it was not honest and their will was falsified.

We are seeing that lesson in the killing fields of Afghanistan and Yemen.</p> <p>Fragile peace agreements are emerging in both conflicts, thanks to skillful diplomats. There are a hundred reasons each negotiation may fail, and in assessing Middle East conflicts, we should remember that, unfortunately, “pessimism pays,” as my former Wall Street Journal colleague Karen Elliott House observed nearly 40 years ago.</p> <p>Recent diplomatic efforts are bolstered by fatigue and frustration at the existing, costly stalemates in both battlefields. The Trump administration (despite the president’s own clumsy statements) has found a balance between saying (rightly) that the wars must end and (wrongly) setting a precise timetable for withdrawing U.S. military support. Ambiguity is the mother of peace deals.</p> <p>Body counts can be misleading, since they don’t measure the underlying will to keep fighting, but they suggest the awful human cost.</p> <p>Growing public outrage has been a factor in curbing both conflicts.</p> <p>War has a momentum that’s hard to stop, even when there’s a broad yearning to end a conflict. </p> <p>But generals don’t end modern wars; diplomats do.</p> <p>Democratic societies fight wars at a disadvantage. The public wants the decisive outcome of victory, but as wars grind on, and people watch the savage endgame live, they hate what they see. The wires get crossed: The putative “good guys” appear to be savage killers; the terrorizing insurgents come to seem the innocent victims.</p> <p>What slows the killing machine are fatigue, popular rage at the human cost of continued fighting and peacemaking formulas that allow each side to claim a measure of success and avoid humiliation. These are the kind of delicate but essential deals that diplomats are struggling to craft in Yemen and Afghanistan.

And in 2003 when the Iraq war was looming, he wrote: “</span>My own gut tells me that this is a war worth fighting.

And in early 2019, he lamented against Trump’s idea to withdraw from Syria (<span><a href="https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2019/01/05/david-ignatius-trumps-perilous-withdrawal-from-syria/">https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2019/01/05/david-ignatius-trumps-perilous-withdrawal-from-syria/</a></span> ). – Does the US ever learn that meddling into other countries’ affairs will have devastating effects anyway? No. Greetings from Venezuela, just now. The regime change game is started again and again. Now in Venezuela, civil war (or even worse) is looming. But also Ignatius will not get it.

Millions of poor people around the world have been harmed as a result of such caprice.</p> <p>In 2017, Prince Turki bin Abdullah , the CEO of the $4 billion King Abdullah Foundation, was arrested on orders from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, better known as MBS. Abdullah is still being detained although hasn’t been charged with any crime. The assets of the foundation were frozen and are currently held at the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. Saudi philanthropist Amr Al-Dabbagh’s U.K.-based Stars Foundation’s activities have also been frozen, as have Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi’s charitable projects in Africa. In addition, members of the King Abdullah family and other prominent businessmen and royal family members have had their Saudi-based bank accounts zeroed out.</p> <p>Why does this matter? The King Abdullah Foundation, the legacy of the late king, is one of the world’s major philanthropies. It has given millions of dollars for health care, low-income housing, and refugee relief. And it planned to give far more. All that has come to a screeching halt, harming many would-be beneficiaries.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/01/30/saudi_leaders_are_choking_charitable_giving___139313.html">https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/01/30/saudi_leaders_are_choking_charitable_giving___139313.html</a></span></p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p><span>Saudi Arabia winds down 15-month anti-corruption campaign</span></p> <p>Saudi Arabia has ended a sprawling crackdown on corruption ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that it said had recovered more than $106 billion through settlements with scores of senior princes, ministers and top businessmen.</p> <p>A royal court statement said the government had summoned 381 people, some as witnesses, under the campaign launched in November 2017, but it provided no names.

Yet, for the frequency with which the US turns to coalitions as a preferred mode of fighting, remarkably little has been done to examine the relationship between coalition operations and civilian casualties. Without examining what makes them unique, it’s hard to know whether coalitions prevent or cause more civilian casualties than unilateral operations, and why.</span></p> <p><span>Research recently concluded by the Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC) suggests a somewhat unsatisfying answer: it depends. The political process of enlisting participation and buy-in from coalition participants can lead to greater accountability and collective restraint, but it can also produce compromises that facilitate or obscure harm. Meanwhile, the parallel chains of command and varied national preferences characteristic of multinational coalitions may allow more cautious members to veto operations that could cause casualties, while also introducing obstacles to preventing and accounting for civilian harm. Most importantly, our research suggests ways to help coalitions better prevent and respond to civilian casualties.</span></p> <p><span>Understanding what makes coalitions different when it comes to civilian harm requires understanding their most important defining features: their parallel command structures and their political character.</span></p> <p>The <span>U.S.</span> military <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/28/james-mattis-defense-secretary-us-isis-annihilation">says</a> it does “everything humanly possible” to avoid civilian casualties.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). “And when it does it will be the first time in the history of our country that a War Powers resolution would have passed both the House and the Senate to stop war. It’s long overdue, and this is going to do an enormous amount to end the suffering in Yemen.”</p> <p>A spokesman for Sanders said both the Vermont senator and Khanna plan to re-introduce the joint resolution later this week.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/house-democrats-challenge-trump-yemen-1133142">https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/house-democrats-challenge-trump-yemen-1133142</a></span></p> <p><span>and also <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/427639-bicameral-coalition-kicks-off-renewed-fight-over-saudi-arabia-yemen">https://thehill.com/policy/defense/427639-bicameral-coalition-kicks-off-renewed-fight-over-saudi-arabia-yemen</a> </span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/01/30/lawmakers-reintroduce-war-powers-resolution-end-carnage-yemen-and-reclaim-congress">https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/01/30/lawmakers-reintroduce-war-powers-resolution-end-carnage-yemen-and-reclaim-congress</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://lieu.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-lieu-yoho-and-malinowski-introduce-bill-prohibit-coalition">https://lieu.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-lieu-yoho-and-malinowski-introduce-bill-prohibit-coalition</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1090660651297591297">https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1090660651297591297</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/lawmakers-block-support-saudi-uae-war-yemen-190130204842754.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/lawmakers-block-support-saudi-uae-war-yemen-190130204842754.html</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-lawmakers-vow-to-end-us-support-saudi-led-forces-yemen-1628387301">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-lawmakers-vow-to-end-us-support-saudi-led-forces-yemen-1628387301</a></span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p><span>Film: </span>Sens.

Recall that in November and December of last year, Paul Ryan, in a final act of his tenure as House speaker, blocked Khanna’s bill from a vote by the full House.</p> <p>For Khanna, this is the culmination of several years of legislative opposition to the US intervention in Yemen. I spoke to Khanna recently about the legislation, what he hopes to achieve by it, and the bill’s prospects for passage.</p> <p>This interview has been edited for clarity and length.</p> <p><em>JC: What did you make of that argument that we have to support the Saudis in order to counter growing Shia influence in the Middle East?</em></p> <p>Ro Khanna: Well, it’s the wrong way of looking at American interests or human rights in the Middle East. This type of thinking has gotten us into trouble, whether it was demonizing Saddam Hussein and creating the conditions for going in to Iraq; or whether it was calling for regime change in Libya or Syria.</p> <p>Now the target seems to be Iran, and there is an obsession with figuring out how to confront Iran. I’m not an apologist for Iran’s actions. Iran certainly has supported activities of terrorism and the Houthis don’t have clean hands. The Houthis have engaged in crimes too.</p> <p>But the idea that that justifies American involvement in a civil war in Yemen doesn’t make any sense strategically. We have no stake in whether Yemen has some Iranian influence or not.</p> <p><em>JC: Yet the Israel lobby gets all the attention.</em></p> <p><span>RK: It’s a sizable lobby. Every time we were trying to get the Yemen vote, they would be out in full force with members of Congress. It’s a significant lobby, and they wine and dine staff and members. And it’s unfortunate that they have the influence they do. I think they suffered a huge blow, though, post-Khashoggi, where sentiments started to really turn against the Saudi regime.</span></p> <p><span>JC: What’s their main tool? Is it the think tanks?</span></p> <p><span>RK: It’s think tanks. They’re publishing op-eds in the papers. It’s influencing the foreign-policy establishment in this country. Then there are the big lobbying firms who continually make the argument that the Saudis contribute to the stability in the Middle East, that without them things would be more chaotic.</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/ro-hanna-war-powers-resolution-yemen/">https://www.thenation.com/article/ro-hanna-war-powers-resolution-yemen/</a></span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Getting the Vote: Ro Khanna’s Fight to End U.S. Involvement in Yemen</p> <p>He’s been fighting the same fight going on two years. In that time, he’s learned to take every victory and build off it, and inch by inch, public opinion has shifted. The flashpoint came in October with the brutal murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but an earlier event—the August school bus bombing in Saada by coalition jets using American bombs that left 44 children dead—also played a role.</p> <p>In December, Sanders and Murphy even managed to secure a victory in the Senate for a war powers resolution to end US involvement in Yemen. However, that victory was short lived as Khanna’s mirror resolution in the House was blocked by then-Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI)</p> <p>Still, even that single victory was a far cry from where the effort stood when Khanna was first approached by peace groups and activists in 2017. He tells me that he’d originally wanted to recruit a more senior House member to be the face behind the effort, but was informed that nobody else was interested. “They were candid and said ‘well we can’t get anyone to introduce a war powers resolution, we’ve been trying and you’re our best bet,’” he explains. “So I introduced it and we started gaining momentum.”</p> <p>We briefly touch on how that momentum came about, despite heavy opposition from the Saudi lobby and the GOP as well as pushback from fellow Democrats. “When we first introduced the legislation in 2017, we were told it was a bad idea,” Khanna would later elaborate in a follow-up email. “We were advised against pushing the legislation and told it would split the Democratic caucus. At the time, believe it or not, not all Democrats wanted to end US involvement in the war and many did not like the War Powers Resolution vehicle.”</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/01/getting-the-vote-ro-khannas-fight-to-end-us-involv.html">https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/01/getting-the-vote-ro-khannas-fight-to-end-us-involv.html</a> </span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(A H P)</span></p> <p>Oxfam response to re-introduction of Yemen War Powers Resolution</p> <p>“Today’s re-introduction of the Yemen War Powers Resolution is another clear signal that members of Congress will no longer accept the United States’ unconditional support for the Saudi-led coalition’s role in Yemen’s deadly war.</p> <p><span>“The eyes of the American people and our elected officials are fixed on this crisis and the role that America has played in it.

Significant credit for that resolution’s earlier momentum, say people closely involved in the process, belongs indirectly to Sarah Smith, a long-shot congressional candidate who challenged Democratic Rep. Adam Smith in Washington last year, making it to the general election before losing. Adam Smith at the time was the top-ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee and is now the panel’s chair, and Sarah Smith mounted her challenge largely in opposition to what she cast as his hawkish foreign policy approach, with a specific emphasis on Yemen.</p> <p>Adam Smith, facing the challenge from Sarah Smith, became an outspoken advocate of using the War Powers Resolution in the fall to go up against the Trump administration, including by becoming a leading sponsor of a new War Powers resolution on Yemen. Now that he has won re-election, he remains a supporter of the effort, but his enthusiasm for it has changed noticeably.</p> <p>“The War Powers resolution thing,” <span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2018/12/adam-smith-doubts-750b-budget-praises-army-downplays-yemen-war-powers-bill/">Smith told trade reporters </a></span>who cover the Pentagon and the weapons industry in a post-election interview in December, before groaning. “There’s no way in the world you can write these stories that’s going to come out in a way that’s positive for me, but I’ll say it anyway: The War Powers resolution is only so useful.”</p> <p>His shift in rhetoric underscores the impact primary challenges can have on internal House politics, but it also could make him vulnerable to another challenge in two years.</p> <p><span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/01/30/adam-smith-yemen-war/">https://theintercept.com/2019/01/30/adam-smith-yemen-war/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p><span>Film: “NewsGuard”: Browser-App entscheidet über “glaubwürdige” oder “unglaubwürdige” News</span></p> <p><span>Das Unternehmen NewsGuard stellt ein Plugin zur Verfügung, das online sämtliche aufgerufenen Nachrichten in glaubwürdig und unglaubwürdig unterteilt.

In many regards, this stems from Cairo’s historic status within the Arab world. Many Yemenis come here to study; an astounding percentage of Yemeni ministers have degrees from Cairo University. Others come here for business related reasons; many of Yemen’s wealthier families have long maintained apartments in the city. Still others came here to plot revolution — or went into exile here after falling on the wrong end of political machinations.</p> <p>The upshot of this is one of the world’s most matured Yemeni diaspora communities. In contrast to, say, Istanbul, the concentrations long predate the war; Doqqi and Manial have had a noticeable Yemeni presence, I’m told, for decades.</p> <p><span>What does this mean on the culinary front? – by Adam Baron</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://medium.com/@adambaron_69940/bab-al-yemen-arabeeska-cairo-ad890cf0398c">https://medium.com/@adambaron_69940/bab-al-yemen-arabeeska-cairo-ad890cf0398c</a></span></p> <p><span>(A K P)</span></p> <p>Le bombe italiane che uccidono i bambini in Yemen.

Doch er landete im Gefängnis. Der Folter ist er knapp entkommen, aber nicht seinen schlechten Träumen.</p> <p>Mit Ausnahme der Provinz Mahra – ganz im Osten des Landes – könne er nicht mehr zurück in seine jemenitische Heimat, erzählt Suwari. Beide Parteien des Bürgerkriegs würden ihn sofort verhaften: auf der einen Seite die mit Iran verbandelte Huthi-Miliz, auf der anderen Seite die von Saudiarabien und den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten unterstützte, international anerkannte Regierung.</p> <p>Sosehr er die Huthi ablehnte, Suwari wurde zunehmend kritischer gegenüber den ausländischen Verbündeten der jemenitischen Regierung Präsident Hadis. «Iran ist ein wichtiger Partner der Huthi, aber diese treffen ihre schlechten Entscheidungen allein», erklärt Suwari. Im Gegensatz dazu übten die Saudi die volle Kontrolle aus: «Anstatt die international anerkannte Regierung zu stärken, schwächen sie sie.»</p> <p>Über Facebook rekrutierte Suwari nach eigenen Angaben 24 Mann für seine Brigade, und er überzeugte den Militärkommandanten der Stadt Marib von seiner Idee. Während eines Monats erhielten die Rekruten im Camp der Sondereinheiten eine militärische Ausbildung und die Geschichte des zum Guerillaführer gewandelten Journalisten machte in <a href="https://www.yemen-24.com/news27504.html">jemenitischen Medien Schlagzeilen</a>.</p> <p>Und Suwari musste sich selbst eingestehen, nicht für den Krieg geschaffen zu sein: «Ich bin kein Superheld.»</p> <p>Der damals 25-Jährige kehrte zum Journalismus zurück. Diesmal allerdings nicht an die Front des Krieges, sondern auf die jemenitische Inselgruppe Sokotra – rund 350 Kilometer von der Küste entfernt. Nachdem Truppen der Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate das von der Unesco geschützte «Galapagos des Indischen Ozeans» im April 2018 besetzt hatten, machte sich Protest in der lokalen Bevölkerung breit.
