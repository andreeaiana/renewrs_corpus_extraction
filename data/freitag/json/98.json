They face a multiplicity of immediate and long-term challenges. Yemen, prior to the war the country with the highest illiteracy rate in the region, is now creating a new generation of illiterate adults, as more than 2 million children (a quarter of the school age population) who should be in education are not.[1] More than 2500 schools are unusable (16% of the total), either because they have been damaged or destroyed by military action (2/3 of cases) or because they have been closed due to lack of staff, are used as shelters for displaced people or have been taken over by the military.", "In a country with limited natural resources, any successful future economic development will depend on highly educated adults able to participate in the modern economy. Better-educated people find higher paid jobs and their likelihood of unemployment is significantly lower, and are therefore less likely to join or support extremist groups.", "In addition to the generation of children who remain out of education, those schools which are actually functioning only do so in a minimal level without equipment or other basics and with staff who, in many cases, have not been paid their salaries for well over two years now. Many teachers have stopped work, seeking an income elsewhere, or simply unable to afford the transport costs. Not only is education essential for the country\u2019s future but, even now, while children are at school, they are far less vulnerable to risks such as recruitment as child soldiers, child labour or, in the case of girls, early marriage.", "Leaving aside the implications for the future of Yemen of millions of uneducated adults, children are currently suffering from many immediate problems which will affect them in the post-war period. As has been amply demonstrated worldwide, low birth weight children are more vulnerable to diseases and early childhood malnutrition reduces people\u2019s intellectual and physical abilities throughout their lives.", "As of December 2018, about 1.1 million pregnant or breast-feeding women and 1.8 million children are malnourished. Many are basically starving", "Close to 1.5 million children have been displaced, millions more are suffering from the trauma resulting from proximity to war zones, including the many active fronts, but also fearing attacks by drones, air strikes and other terrifying events which can happen anywhere in the country suddenly out of clear skies, day or night.", "The fear and terror induced by this situation, combined with increasingly difficult, not to say, unbearable, living (or more accurately, survival) conditions are creating a generation of psychologically scarred people, many of whom will never be able to live normal lives.", "We have not even mentioned here the issue of child soldiers; in an environment where there are no jobs, where families are desperate and adults [when \u2018employed\u2019] have not been paid, joining a militia or other military organisation features as a positive option for boys from an early age.", "Most importantly, once this pointless and murderous war ends, the future of Yemen will depend on its children. They will inherit a country destroyed by the self-serving leaderships which have brought horrific and unprecedented levels of suffering to Yemenis, showing neither compassion nor commitment to find solutions to Yemen\u2019s fundamental problems.

As such, the handling of government ministries taken over by them when they entered Sanaa has not been efficient, and their holding of the purse strings has not been without corruption. Perhaps most alarming has been the rough handling of journalists and dissenters", "What they are not: For all their faults and the original sin of having precipitated the violence with their coup against the Hadi government, the Houthis are not international terrorists. Through their wars first against and then alongside former president Saleh, they never showed any interest in exporting violence outside their region. Their attacks on Saudi Arabia, to include rocket launches, were undertaken only after Saudi forces attacked them.", "Further, despite their anti-American slogans, they have not undertaken any attacks against Americans, whether inside or outside Yemen.", "The Houthis have been party to several agreements with the central government as well as with Saudi Arabia.", "All this to say, their profile is not that of a terrorist organization bent only on causing death and destruction.", "The Houthis have engaged in peace talks before, are currently involved in implementing the Sweden accords and have also issued invitations to the international media and representatives of western governments to visit Sanaa and observe the situation on the ground for themselves.", "Abdulmalek al-Houthi may not be the easiest person to reach, but he surrounds himself with a political council of 10-14 individuals with varying degrees of savviness and the ability to conduct talks and negotiations.

Better-educated people find higher paid jobs and their likelihood of unemployment is significantly lower, and are therefore less likely to join or support extremist groups.", "In addition to the generation of children who remain out of education, those schools which are actually functioning only do so in a minimal level without equipment or other basics and with staff who, in many cases, have not been paid their salaries for well over two years now. Many teachers have stopped work, seeking an income elsewhere, or simply unable to afford the transport costs. Not only is education essential for the country\u2019s future but, even now, while children are at school, they are far less vulnerable to risks such as recruitment as child soldiers, child labour or, in the case of girls, early marriage.", "Leaving aside the implications for the future of Yemen of millions of uneducated adults, children are currently suffering from many immediate problems which will affect them in the post-war period. As has been amply demonstrated worldwide, low birth weight children are more vulnerable to diseases and early childhood malnutrition reduces people\u2019s intellectual and physical abilities throughout their lives.", "As of December 2018, about 1.1 million pregnant or breast-feeding women and 1.8 million children are malnourished.
