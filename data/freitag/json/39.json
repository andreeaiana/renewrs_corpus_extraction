The humanitarian situation in Yemen, in its sixth year of conflict, is still the worst in the world.", "Some 24 million people, which is 80 per cent of the country\u2019s entire population, require some form of assistance or protection.", "2. COVID-19 is now in Yemen, and we are running out of time.", "The country needs urgent support to deal with the pandemic. Epidemiologists warn that COVID-19 in Yemen could spread faster, more widely and with deadlier consequences than in many other countries. Nearly 18 million people in Yemen do not have regular access to clean water, and the conflict has destroyed health-care facilities and left people with some of the lowest levels of immunity and highest levels of acute vulnerability in the world.", "3. Major UN programmes in Yemen face reduction or closure, with devastating impact on efforts to prepare for COVID-19.", "Of the UN\u2019s 41 major programmes in Yemen, 31 will start to close in the next few weeks if we do not secure additional funds. Up to 1 million displaced people will not be able to receive critical supplies \u2013 including hygiene items that help protect against diseases such as cholera and COVID-19. Nutrition programmes will also be cut, affecting 260,000 severely malnourished children and 2 million more children with moderate malnutrition. At least 80 per cent of health services provided through the response could stop at the end of April. This could mean disbanding local health teams that have been and would be essential in detecting COVID-19 and containing past disease outbreaks such as cholera.", "4. Yemen\u2019s currency could collapse as the global economy grapples with the impact of COVID-19.", "Rapid, uncontrolled currency depreciation was a key factor in bringing Yemen to the brink of widespread famine 18 months ago. The price of oil, Yemen\u2019s main source of revenue, has fallen, which will make it harder for the country to pay for salaries or for imports, which the country relies heavily on. Most Yemenis depend on remittances, which is estimated to bring in more than $3 billion a year. But economists predict that remittances could drop by as much as 70 per cent in the coming months as COVID-19 slows down economies.", "5. Yemen\u2019s health system is on the verge of collapse.", "Nearly half of health facilities are non-functioning or partially functioning. Equipment and medical supplies are inadequate or obsolete, and health workers have gone without pay or received irregular pay for more than two years.", "6. Malnutrition rates among women and children in Yemen remain among the highest in the world", "More than 1 million women and 2 million children require treatment for acute malnutrition.", "7. Civilians, mostly children, are bearing the brunt of the violence.", "In the first quarter of this year, civilian casualties have risen every month, with more than 500 people killed or injured. One in every three civilian casualties has been a child. In Al Jawf \u2013 where hostilities escalated in mid-January \u2013 that rate is now one in two.", "8. Humanitarian aid has been a lifeline for many Yemenis.", "Every month, we help more than 13 million people across Yemen, and provide food to nearly 12 million of those people. In 2019, humanitarian agencies supported 3,100 health facilities and conducted 17 million medical consultations. More than 11 million people were able to access clean water and sanitation and nearly 1 million acutely malnourished children were treated.", "9. UN agencies estimate they need more than $900 million to carry them through July.", "So far, we have received about $800 million in pledges and contributions for the response this year. At this time in 2019, the equivalent figure was more than three times higher \u2013 about $2.6 billion.

This financial aid is further reduced by corruption and payoffs that plague both the Yemeni government, Houthi forces and the in-country staff of NGO\u2019s who have siphoned off millions via protection, ghost shipments, uncompetitive contracts or just blatant theft. The crisis is so rampant, that the UNDP believes the few medical centres in operation struggle with shortages of essential medicines, supplies, healthcare workers, safe water, fuel and power, despite the hundreds of millions in funding provided for their assistance.", "At the heart of the issue, the amount of aid needed to successfully implement wide-scale medical and social support structures in war-torn nations is exceedingly large. It simply is not being met by the international community.", "This means budgeting for vaccine programs or medical centres is drastically limited, placing groups like the International Red Cross or the WHO into a hopeless situation, as the large amount of work they carry out is achievable only by working with the factions that have split Yemen in half. Several ex-officials interviewed by the AP believe that this capitulation to the militia groups is causing more harm than good.", "The clearest evidence of medical assistance being used to economically support the war effort has been the Houthi run Ministry of Health demand in 2018, for the UN to supply 45 ambulances that were subsequently placed into front line military use. The UN\u2019s complete lack of understanding of the political situation in the region provides a clear view of how the political and military climate of Yemen has crippled the fight to get Cholera vaccines and basic medical equipment to at-risk populations. It has directly resulted in economic material and political support from international peacekeeping groups going to the war fighters, culminating in more harm for the civilian populations that the WHO has sworn to protect.", "The weakening of the international rules-based order, combined with the UN\u2019s weak position and their reliance on government-approved visas, have crippled any attempts by officials to speak out about corruption within all levels of the medical and governmental systems.", "When approached for comment by the Associated Press, Youssef al-Hadri, the spokesman of the Houthi-run Health Ministry, asserted that claims of Houthis blocking shipments were false, stating that \u201cthis is all baseless, and I challenge the agencies to say this officially,\u201d knowing that in doing so, the agencies would be signing their deportation papers. This strong-arming forces Geert Cappelaere, the Middle East director for UNICEF, to simply state to the Associated Press of an existing \u201cskepticism among the authorities on both sides\u201d about the value of cholera vaccines. A statement as spineless as it is telling about how the powers that be view the aid they are provided, not as a source of assistance but as an economic commodity to be milked for all its worth.", "However, the mismanagement would be limited to simple state-run extortion if it wasn\u2019t for the rampant corruption inside NGO\u2019s and UN office staff deployed to Yemen.", "The politicisation of NGO\u2019s supply of medical aid and economic support within Yemen is dictated by the Republic of Yemen\u2019s legal system, which rules that \u201cThe Minister has the right to, for security or political reasons, freeze/suspend the operations of any organization, and the Minister also has the right to present the case to the judiciary.\u201d It cripples NGOs\u2019 ability to make any statements or refusals to any of the minister\u2019s requests, since doing so would likely result in the organisation\u2019s visas being cancelled outright. This initial act of complicit corruption by the NGO\u2019s and UN agencies caused a ripple effect throughout all organisational levels. It directly affects the people of Yemen, who are now neglected by both their government and the international community \u2013 by Callum Reeves", "https://theowp.org/reports/corruption-cripples-yemen/", "My comment: This report is by \u201cOrganization for World Peace\u201d. It is very critical on behalf of the Houthis \u2013 which certainly is reasonable in this regard.

The Yemeni Abductees\u2019 Mothers Association documented about 244 prisons and places of detention used by the Houthi group spreading all over Yemen. According to field reports, the number of abductees and enforced disappearance cases by the Houthi group reached about 12,636 in 20 Yemeni governorates, including doctors, politicians, academics, activists, and educators.", "Unofficial prisons are known locally to be former government buildings and state institutions. Secret detention centers are usually located at checkpoints, homes of political opponents and citizens, places of worship, and schools, which were taken over by the group to hide and torture civilians.

COVID-19 is now in Yemen, and we are running out of time.", "The country needs urgent support to deal with the pandemic. Epidemiologists warn that COVID-19 in Yemen could spread faster, more widely and with deadlier consequences than in many other countries.

Nutrition programmes will also be cut, affecting 260,000 severely malnourished children and 2 million more children with moderate malnutrition. At least 80 per cent of health services provided through the response could stop at the end of April.

The price of oil, Yemen\u2019s main source of revenue, has fallen, which will make it harder for the country to pay for salaries or for imports, which the country relies heavily on. Most Yemenis depend on remittances, which is estimated to bring in more than $3 billion a year. But economists predict that remittances could drop by as much as 70 per cent in the coming months as COVID-19 slows down economies.", "5.

The UN\u2019s complete lack of understanding of the political situation in the region provides a clear view of how the political and military climate of Yemen has crippled the fight to get Cholera vaccines and basic medical equipment to at-risk populations.
