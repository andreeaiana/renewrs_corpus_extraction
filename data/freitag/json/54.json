The Saudi government\u2019s murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in late 2018 galvanized the international community to scrutinize Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights violations in Yemen and their own potential complicity in these abuses through arms sales.  The Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi armed group fighting since March 2015 are responsible for laws-of-war violations and human rights abuses. The conflict has killed and injured thousands of civilians. A United Nations report in September 2019 found that: \u201cparties to the conflict in Yemen are responsible for an array of human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law. Some of these violations are likely to amount to war crimes.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s well-established that the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi forces are indiscriminately attacking, forcibly disappearing, and obstructing food and medicine to Yemeni civilians, among other abuses,\u201d said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe international community, including states allied with parties to the conflict, should use the leverage they have to press the warring parties to end their violations and ensure accountability.\u201d", "Since March 2015, the coalition has conducted scores of indiscriminate and disproportionate airstrikes killing thousands of civilians and hitting civilian objects in violation of the laws of war, using munitions sold by the United States, United Kingdom, and others. The airstrike on a detention center in August 2019 that killed and wounded at least 200 people was the single deadliest attack since the war began.  Houthi forces have used banned antipersonnel landmines and fired artillery indiscriminately into cities such as Taizz and Hodeida, killing and wounding civilians, and indiscriminately launched ballistic missiles into Saudi Arabia.  The conflict has had a devastating impact on the lives of ordinary Yemenis, placing millions of people at risk of famine. Yemen\u2019s economy, already fragile prior to the conflict, has been gravely affected. Hundreds of thousands of families no longer have a steady source of income, and many public servants have not received a regular salary in several years.  Houthi forces, the Yemeni government, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, and various UAE and Saudi-backed Yemeni armed groups have arbitrarily detained people, including children, and committed forced disappearances. Houthi forces have held people hostage. Yemeni officials in Aden have beaten, raped, and tortured detained migrants and asylum seekers from the Horn of Africa, including women and children.

The establishment of these forces, however, has encountered mixed results depending on local contexts. As seen in this piece, SBF, for instance, have gone rather unchallenged in Lahij, where they seem to enjoy considerable support from political elites and the population. In Abyan, the province of origin of President Hadi, they have, on the other hand, been faced with opposition by pro-Hadi forces. In Aden, they seem to have gained significant influence \u2014 they managed to overtake the city twice in the past two years \u2014 but this has been restrained by Riyadh, which cannot afford to see the Hadi government ousted from the country\u2019s interim capital after it already lost Sana\u2019a in 2014.", "In Shabwah, if the Shabwani Elite Forces have managed to become primary actors of the governorate based on the fight against militant jihadi groups, underlying tensions with pro-Hadi forces led to outbreaks of violence in August 2019. These can arguably be explained by the economic significance of the governorate, which, in addition to housing its own oil and gas fields, also acts as a crucial gateway for the gas coming from neighboring Marib, delivered at the controversial Balhaf facility (L\u2019Observatoire des armements, SumOfUs and Les Amis de la Terre France, 7 November 2019). Control over Shabwah therefore yields economic power.", "On the other hand, clashes did not erupt in neighboring Hadramawt, where Hadrami Elite Forces (HEF) also established themselves as primary actors after ousting AQAP from its capital Mukalla in April 2015. Unlike in Shabwah, a tacit understanding seems to exist between pro-Hadi and HEF in Hadramawt. Despite recurrent calls from the STC leadership for the takeover of inland Hadramawt by the HEF, the latter remains focused on the coastal regions, while pro-Hadi forces operate mostly in Hadramawt Valley and the upper desert areas. Arguably, the strong subnational Hadrami identity also prevents a splitting up of the governorate.", "In Socotra and Mahrah, the establishment of local pro-STC forces has been much less successful. Despite initial reports on the formation of \u2018Socotri Elite Forces\u2019, pro-STC forces on the island are now referred to as SBF. If their successes in establishing positions and gaining popularity is yet not entirely clear, a spike in protests calling for the dismissal of the local governor has been registered by ACLED since June 2019, coinciding with the arrival of SBF on the island. In Mahrah, initial reports of the formation of Mahri Elite Forces in February 2019 never materialized. All Saudi-led coalition activity in the governorate is being faced with strong popular opposition, which is likely, at least in part, instrumentalized by neighboring Oman. Former Deputy for Desert Affairs Ali Salim Al-Hurayzi, for instance, announced the creation of the Southern National Salvation Council in October 2019 as a rival to the STC, which he accuses of being a foreign agent in Yemen (Masa Press, 6 November 2019).", "If similarities can be found across most governorates, the above shows that Southern Yemen cannot be addressed as a monolithic unit of study.

Diese Faktoren f\u00fchren zu einer allgemeinen ideologischen Sto\u00dfrichtung der Nachrichteninhalte: bestimmte Sachverhalte und Fakten werden hervorgehoben andere bagatellisiert.", "In gro\u00dfen Teilen der deutschen Medienkultur gilt die Auffassung, dass der von den USA angef\u00fchrte Westen beim \u201eKrieg gegen den Terror\u201c in Afghanistan und anderen L\u00e4ndern mit grunds\u00e4tzlich \u201eguten\u201c Absichten auftritt. Demnach ginge es bei dem Einsatz, an dem sich ja auch Deutschland seit Dezember 2001 beteiligt, darum, Terroristen zu bek\u00e4mpfen und beispielsweise in Afghanistan f\u00fcr Frieden, Sicherheit und Stabilit\u00e4t zu sorgen. Auch konzentriert sich die Berichterstattung auf die Taliban, die in den Medien als \u201eKiller\u201c und \u201eFeinde der Menschlichkeit\u201c bezeichnet und daher, so wird es suggeriert, von unseren Soldaten bek\u00e4mpft werden m\u00fcssen. Es mag erstaunlich klingen: Die in der deutschen Medienberichterstattung \u00fcber Afghanistan verwendeten ideologischen Erkl\u00e4rungsmuster \u00e4hneln zum Teil den Diskursen der sowjetischen Staatspresse. Das zeigt eine Studie des britischen Medienwachhundes Media Lens, die die sowjetische Medienberichterstattung \u00fcber die sowjetische Intervention in Afghanistan in den 1980er Jahren mit der westlichen Medienberichterstattung der US-angef\u00fchrten Intervention in Afghanistan in den 2000er Jahren vergleicht. 1979 marschierten sowjetische Truppen in Afghanistan ein, um einen Aufstand militanter Gruppen, der auch zuk\u00fcnftige F\u00fchrer der Taliban miteinbezog, zu bek\u00e4mpfen. Die auf den Einmarsch folgende Besatzung dauerte bis 1989 und hatte verheerende Folgen f\u00fcr das Land. Staatsgesteuerte sowjetische Presseorgane wie Krasnaya Zvezda oder Pravda bezeichneten die sowjetische Milit\u00e4rkampagne in Afghanistan als eine friedenssichernde Mission. Laut der Sowjetpresse sei es bei der Intervention darum gegangen, afghanische Zivilisten vor Jihadisten und Terroristen zu sch\u00fctzen und f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Region und in der russischen Heimat zu sorgen. \u00dcber die enorme Zahl get\u00f6teter Afghanen, die auf 1.5 Millionen gesch\u00e4tzt wird, berichteten die Sowjetmedien kaum.", "So ist es, aber auch bei uns werden solche Zahlen unter den Teppich gekehrt. Konservative Sch\u00e4tzungen gehen davon aus, dass seit Beginn des \u201eKrieg gegen den Terror\u201c 480.000 Menschen durch direkte Gewalt in Afghanistan, Pakistan und Irak get\u00f6tet wurden, wobei die Zahl der indirekten Todesf\u00e4lle (durch Krankheit, Vertreibung und Zerst\u00f6rung vitaler Infrastruktur) wohl im Millionenbereich liegt. Durch das von US-Pr\u00e4sident Barack Obama durchgef\u00fchrte Drohnen-Programm wurden innerhalb von f\u00fcnf Jahren 2.400 Menschen in Pakistan, Jemen und Somalia get\u00f6tet, viele davon Zivilisten. Nach Angaben der New American Foundation handelte es sich nur bei etwa 3 Prozent (51 Personen) der get\u00f6teten in Pakistan um \u201eF\u00fchrer der Militanten\u201c von denen 30 Mitglieder von Al-Qaida waren.", "Wie gehen Medien nun mit diesen Fakten um?", "Sie spielen sie runter. Genauso wie die Frage, ob es sich beim \u201eKrieg gegen den Terror\u201c um ein global-hegemoniales Projekt des Westens handeln k\u00f6nnte. Daten des Costs of War Projects zeigen: US-amerikanische \u201eAntiterror\u201c-Einheiten sind derzeit weltweit in 76 L\u00e4ndern (39% des Erdballs) stationiert. Von dort aus werden Drohnen- und Luftschl\u00e4ge koordiniert und paramilit\u00e4rische Milizen ausgebildet. Ein Netz von 700-800 US-Milit\u00e4rbasen dient der Projektion und Sicherung westlicher Macht. Und genau diese Politik erh\u00f6ht die Wahrscheinlichkeit f\u00fcr Terroranschl\u00e4ge im Westen.

Pape verweist auf eine eindeutige Beziehung zwischen westlichen Milit\u00e4rbesatzungen und Selbstmordterrorismus (Pape hat in seiner Studie 315 Selbstmordattentate zwischen 1980 und 2003 untersucht). Demnach sei das Hauptmotiv des Selbstmordterrorismus ein s\u00e4kulares und strategisches Ziel: moderne Demokratien sollen gezwungen werden, ihre milit\u00e4rischen Kr\u00e4fte von dem Hoheitsgebiet abzuziehen, das die Terroristen als ihr Heimatland ansehen.

Noting that experience shows that military de-escalation cannot be sustained without political progress, he said that daily detailed negotiations can lead to key appointments in Aden in the coming days in line with the Riyadh Agreement, representing a starting point to open a new page to reach a political solution. Regarding the Hudaydah Agreement signed in Stockholm in 2018, no one should be satisfied with the record of its implementation. Although violence continues in southern districts, relative calm on the frontlines of the city demonstrate that de-escalation measures are working, with the Redeployment Coordination Committee engaged in discussions on opening humanitarian corridors.", "Despite these achievements, he remained concerned about persistent restrictions on the freedom of movement of personnel of the United Nations Mission to Support the Hudaydah Agreement (UNMHA), calling for the immediate resumption of Mission patrols of the city and ports.

Nonetheless, hostilities are flaring again along several front lines, particularly in Al Dhale\u2019e, Hudaydah and Shabwah, and while mostly contained, mass casualty incidents persist across the country amid daily reports of civilians killed or injured when shells land on their homes, snipers fire on their communities or landmines explode. \u201cIt is unacceptable that civilians should do disproportionately bear the brunt of this conflict,\u201d he said, urging parties to uphold their international humanitarian law obligations and to move as quickly as possible to a nationwide ceasefire.", "On humanitarian access, he said that access constraints affect 6.7 million people in need of assistance, a figure that has never been so high amid harassment and violence against humanitarian agencies in northern Yemen. Staff are harassed and arbitrarily detained \u2014 sometimes for extended periods \u2014 while missions are delayed or cancelled. His Office engages continuously with the Ansar Allah authorities about such concerns and was encouraged that its officials had agreed, without conditions, to the assessment of the SAFER oil tanker decaying off the Hudaydah coast and at risk of rupturing. The Office was later disappointed when other officials reversed that position and it is now following up with authorities to confirm how to proceed.

Smugglers, who belong to Yemeni and African mafias, help the victims to get out of their country by transporting them to Yemen, via small and inadequately equipped fishing boats that take them to the Yemeni shores.", "As of February 2018, Yemen was hosting about 281,000 refugees, many of whom were Somalis who are recognized as refugees and asylum seekers.

The aim of the series is to uncover the various patterns of political violence playing out in the South of Yemen and its different actors, amid a context of increased state fragmentation exacerbated by the current conflict.", "Along with the fight against militant jihadi groups, the main feature of political violence in most of Southern Yemen in the last five years has been the emergence of pro-STC and UAE-backed armed forces, which effectively operate as paramilitary forces despite being formal state actors of the Hadi government. The establishment of these forces, however, has encountered mixed results depending on local contexts. As seen in this piece, SBF, for instance, have gone rather unchallenged in Lahij, where they seem to enjoy considerable support from political elites and the population. In Abyan, the province of origin of President Hadi, they have, on the other hand, been faced with opposition by pro-Hadi forces. In Aden, they seem to have gained significant influence \u2014 they managed to overtake the city twice in the past two years \u2014 but this has been restrained by Riyadh, which cannot afford to see the Hadi government ousted from the country\u2019s interim capital after it already lost Sana\u2019a in 2014.", "In Shabwah, if the Shabwani Elite Forces have managed to become primary actors of the governorate based on the fight against militant jihadi groups, underlying tensions with pro-Hadi forces led to outbreaks of violence in August 2019. These can arguably be explained by the economic significance of the governorate, which, in addition to housing its own oil and gas fields, also acts as a crucial gateway for the gas coming from neighboring Marib, delivered at the controversial Balhaf facility (L\u2019Observatoire des armements, SumOfUs and Les Amis de la Terre France, 7 November 2019). Control over Shabwah therefore yields economic power.", "On the other hand, clashes did not erupt in neighboring Hadramawt, where Hadrami Elite Forces (HEF) also established themselves as primary actors after ousting AQAP from its capital Mukalla in April 2015. Unlike in Shabwah, a tacit understanding seems to exist between pro-Hadi and HEF in Hadramawt. Despite recurrent calls from the STC leadership for the takeover of inland Hadramawt by the HEF, the latter remains focused on the coastal regions, while pro-Hadi forces operate mostly in Hadramawt Valley and the upper desert areas. Arguably, the strong subnational Hadrami identity also prevents a splitting up of the governorate.", "In Socotra and Mahrah, the establishment of local pro-STC forces has been much less successful. Despite initial reports on the formation of \u2018Socotri Elite Forces\u2019, pro-STC forces on the island are now referred to as SBF. If their successes in establishing positions and gaining popularity is yet not entirely clear, a spike in protests calling for the dismissal of the local governor has been registered by ACLED since June 2019, coinciding with the arrival of SBF on the island. In Mahrah, initial reports of the formation of Mahri Elite Forces in February 2019 never materialized. All Saudi-led coalition activity in the governorate is being faced with strong popular opposition, which is likely, at least in part, instrumentalized by neighboring Oman. Former Deputy for Desert Affairs Ali Salim Al-Hurayzi, for instance, announced the creation of the Southern National Salvation Council in October 2019 as a rival to the STC, which he accuses of being a foreign agent in Yemen (Masa Press, 6 November 2019).", "If similarities can be found across most governorates, the above shows that Southern Yemen cannot be addressed as a monolithic unit of study. Despite actors such as the STC claiming to be the sole representative of the Southern people, the specificities of each local context needs to be taken into account in any attempt at stabilizing Southern Yemen.", "https://www.acleddata.com/2020/01/16/yemens-fractured-south-acleds-three-part-series/ = https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-s-fractured-south-acled-s-three-part-series", "(** B P)", "Florian Zollmann \u00fcber Auslandsberichterstattung: \u201eDas f\u00fchrt zum Versagen der Demokratie\u201c", "Wie sieht es aus, wenn Medien mit zweierlei Ma\u00df messen?

Wie wir in unserem letzten Interview festgestellt haben, sind Nachrichten das Resultat einer vorherrschenden Ideologie und Kultur. Miteinander verbundene Interessen aus Politik und Wirtschaft beeinflussen die Medien in ihrer Eigenschaft als Quellen des \u201eobjektiven\u201c Journalismus. Aber auch Eigentumsstrukturen, Anteilseignung, Werbeabh\u00e4ngigkeit, Netzwerke und Lobbying spielen eine Rolle. Diese Faktoren f\u00fchren zu einer allgemeinen ideologischen Sto\u00dfrichtung der Nachrichteninhalte: bestimmte Sachverhalte und Fakten werden hervorgehoben andere bagatellisiert.", "In gro\u00dfen Teilen der deutschen Medienkultur gilt die Auffassung, dass der von den USA angef\u00fchrte Westen beim \u201eKrieg gegen den Terror\u201c in Afghanistan und anderen L\u00e4ndern mit grunds\u00e4tzlich \u201eguten\u201c Absichten auftritt. Demnach ginge es bei dem Einsatz, an dem sich ja auch Deutschland seit Dezember 2001 beteiligt, darum, Terroristen zu bek\u00e4mpfen und beispielsweise in Afghanistan f\u00fcr Frieden, Sicherheit und Stabilit\u00e4t zu sorgen. Auch konzentriert sich die Berichterstattung auf die Taliban, die in den Medien als \u201eKiller\u201c und \u201eFeinde der Menschlichkeit\u201c bezeichnet und daher, so wird es suggeriert, von unseren Soldaten bek\u00e4mpft werden m\u00fcssen. Es mag erstaunlich klingen: Die in der deutschen Medienberichterstattung \u00fcber Afghanistan verwendeten ideologischen Erkl\u00e4rungsmuster \u00e4hneln zum Teil den Diskursen der sowjetischen Staatspresse. Das zeigt eine Studie des britischen Medienwachhundes Media Lens, die die sowjetische Medienberichterstattung \u00fcber die sowjetische Intervention in Afghanistan in den 1980er Jahren mit der westlichen Medienberichterstattung der US-angef\u00fchrten Intervention in Afghanistan in den 2000er Jahren vergleicht. 1979 marschierten sowjetische Truppen in Afghanistan ein, um einen Aufstand militanter Gruppen, der auch zuk\u00fcnftige F\u00fchrer der Taliban miteinbezog, zu bek\u00e4mpfen. Die auf den Einmarsch folgende Besatzung dauerte bis 1989 und hatte verheerende Folgen f\u00fcr das Land. Staatsgesteuerte sowjetische Presseorgane wie Krasnaya Zvezda oder Pravda bezeichneten die sowjetische Milit\u00e4rkampagne in Afghanistan als eine friedenssichernde Mission. Laut der Sowjetpresse sei es bei der Intervention darum gegangen, afghanische Zivilisten vor Jihadisten und Terroristen zu sch\u00fctzen und f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Region und in der russischen Heimat zu sorgen. \u00dcber die enorme Zahl get\u00f6teter Afghanen, die auf 1.5 Millionen gesch\u00e4tzt wird, berichteten die Sowjetmedien kaum.", "So ist es, aber auch bei uns werden solche Zahlen unter den Teppich gekehrt. Konservative Sch\u00e4tzungen gehen davon aus, dass seit Beginn des \u201eKrieg gegen den Terror\u201c 480.000 Menschen durch direkte Gewalt in Afghanistan, Pakistan und Irak get\u00f6tet wurden, wobei die Zahl der indirekten Todesf\u00e4lle (durch Krankheit, Vertreibung und Zerst\u00f6rung vitaler Infrastruktur) wohl im Millionenbereich liegt. Durch das von US-Pr\u00e4sident Barack Obama durchgef\u00fchrte Drohnen-Programm wurden innerhalb von f\u00fcnf Jahren 2.400 Menschen in Pakistan, Jemen und Somalia get\u00f6tet, viele davon Zivilisten. Nach Angaben der New American Foundation handelte es sich nur bei etwa 3 Prozent (51 Personen) der get\u00f6teten in Pakistan um \u201eF\u00fchrer der Militanten\u201c von denen 30 Mitglieder von Al-Qaida waren.", "Wie gehen Medien nun mit diesen Fakten um?", "Sie spielen sie runter. Genauso wie die Frage, ob es sich beim \u201eKrieg gegen den Terror\u201c um ein global-hegemoniales Projekt des Westens handeln k\u00f6nnte. Daten des Costs of War Projects zeigen: US-amerikanische \u201eAntiterror\u201c-Einheiten sind derzeit weltweit in 76 L\u00e4ndern (39% des Erdballs) stationiert. Von dort aus werden Drohnen- und Luftschl\u00e4ge koordiniert und paramilit\u00e4rische Milizen ausgebildet. Ein Netz von 700-800 US-Milit\u00e4rbasen dient der Projektion und Sicherung westlicher Macht. Und genau diese Politik erh\u00f6ht die Wahrscheinlichkeit f\u00fcr Terroranschl\u00e4ge im Westen.

Demnach sei das Hauptmotiv des Selbstmordterrorismus ein s\u00e4kulares und strategisches Ziel: moderne Demokratien sollen gezwungen werden, ihre milit\u00e4rischen Kr\u00e4fte von dem Hoheitsgebiet abzuziehen, das die Terroristen als ihr Heimatland ansehen.

Staff are harassed and arbitrarily detained \u2014 sometimes for extended periods \u2014 while missions are delayed or cancelled.

The aim was to show that in the Middle East, Sunni and Shiite affiliations matter in the relationship between the regional powers and respective proxies, as opposing to realist statement that alliances, conflicts and political developments are only governed by pragmatic power interests. Additionally, the work examines whether religious national identities have impact on the dynamics of proxy conflicts. Overall, the objective was to establish comprehensive image of how ideational/constructivist and pragmatic/realist factors work in combination to influence alliances, enmities and conflicts in the Middle East. Using qualitative methods of research, religious (national) identities of Saudi Arabia, Iran and their allies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen were constructed so as to create ideational and realist points of departure, and then interlinked to show how convergence of religious identities helps in creating durable alliances if used in targeted manner as a strategic tool which can help safeguard national interests. The work shows notable differences in the use of this tool between Saudi Arabia and Iran, suggesting that it may influence foreign policy successes and failures.

The workshop participants agreed that Yemen\u2019s human capital accumulation has almost certainly regressed since the current conflict began. However, there is a dearth of reliable data to assess the scope and nature of this regression and thus how to best direct responses. There was also a consensus that many of the obstacles to improving Yemen\u2019s human capital were present prior to the current conflict. In line with these findings, this brief recommends: countrywide population surveys; more funding of development projects over emergency humanitarian assistance; education reforms; and the targeting of sectors with high human capital returns. Crucially, policymakers should not wait for the end of the conflict to implement these recommendations. Investment in Yemen\u2019s human capital now, specifically in geographic areas away from frontline fighting, should hasten the speed of the post-conflict economic recovery and lay the foundations for the sustainable development of the economy beyond the war.", "From the Introduction", "While workshop participants agreed that the current conflict has likely precipitated a regression in Yemen\u2019s human capital accumulation, much of this decline can be attributed to a magnification of pre-existing problems. For decades, rather than investing in human capital, the Yemeni government pursued a narrow economic vision based on Yemen\u2019s depleting oil reserves. Acknowledgment of the historically entrenched, structural constraints that have hindered human capital development in Yemen fed into discussions on how best to reverse this trend in the short, medium and long term. Participants sought to identify opportunities to instigate change in spite of the ongoing conflict, with the ideal (but not easily achievable) goal of identifying measures that would not only provide immediate relief but also endure beyond the conflict.", "Amid weakened state governance in Yemen since the outbreak of the current conflict, there is scope for greater private sector investment in human capital. The state still has a lead role to play in terms of oversight and policy formation, but the private sector is in a stronger, more flexible position to assist with the implementation of certain policies designed to strengthen Yemen\u2019s human capital development. Participants stressed the need for greater coordination between the public and private sectors concerning Yemen\u2019s education system and the provision of knowledge and skills that will better prepare Yemenis for the domestic and foreign job markets.
