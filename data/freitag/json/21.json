Incidents Assessment Team\u201d (JIAT) neither is \u201cindependent\u201d, nor it is a team to investigate the Saudi coalition air raids \u2013 it\u2019s nothing more than a scam to pretend that the coalition is caring for human rights. The only function is whitewashing Saudi coalition war crimes and giving the international public a pretense to continue arms sales and further support. The methods used are: Simply denial; claiming that there had been any \u201cmilitary target\u201d at the site; claiming that there had been \u201cHouthis\u201d at the site. Also just keep in mind that in this war, there could not exist any \u201clegitimate\u201d military targets, as it\u2019s a war of aggression, what excludes the possibility that that any target \u2013 whatever it actually is \u2013 could be a \u201clegitimate\u201d military target.", "Zabid, Al Hodeida, Jan. 3, 2018:", "http://www.sabanews.net/en/news483749.htm", "http://www.sabanews.net/en/news483782.htm", "Photos: Most of them are more available, saved by me", "https://twitter.com/narrabyee/status/949147160351657985", "Film: Deleted by facebook, thus covering war crimes, making clear that Facebook is taking sides with war criminals (films had been saved by me)", "Mothalath Ahim market, Hajjah: July 4, 2015:", "Photos: http://poorworld.net/Yemen/YemenImages105.htm", "http://poorworld.net/Yemen/YemenImages106.htm", "Report: http://www.sabanews.net/ar/news399111.htm", "Film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTPWlg1vNHk", "Bellingcat report: https://yemen.bellingcat.com/investigations/the-yemen-project-haj10003-aahim-triangle-bani-hassan-hajjah, concluding: From the open sources available it is clear that on the night of 2015-07-04 a munition, most likely air-dropped, detonated in the middle of Muthalith Aahim, close to restaurants and a water truck.
