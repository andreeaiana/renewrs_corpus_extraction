Though maternal mortality still lies at the heart of maternal health indicators, there is a growing concern about the impact of mental and behavioural health on maternal health outcomes. World Health Organization (WHO) is proposing a stronger focus on mental health for an integrated delivery of services for Maternal- and Child Health (MCH).  Aim: The overall aim is to gain insight into the experience of Yemeni women of modern and traditional care during childbirth, their perceived mental status and health care seeking patterns. The focus of the thesis is on women\u2019s reproductive mental health in the context of culture and health care systems.  Methods:", "A multi-stage (stratified-purposive-random) sampling process was used. Two hundred and twenty women with childbirth experience in five governorates \u2013 Aden, Lahej, Hadramout, Taiz and Hodeidah \u2013 were interviewed by means of a semi-structured questionnaire. Half of the women lived in urban, half in rural areas. Questions concerned the most recent pregnancy and childbirth (location, attendance and perceived quality); postpartum period; women\u2019s empowerment and social and demographic information. A pre-test of the questionnaire was carried out in Taiz.", "Interviews were made by two Yemeni nurse-midwives and two medical doctors, one of whom was an obstetrician-gynaecologist, and one a Sudanese nurse-midwife. All women approached for an interview were initially explained about the purpose of the study and asked whether they would agree to participate. Interviews lasted for 1-3 hours. All performed interviews were discussed daily among team members.", "Results: A large majority of women perceived childbirth as a situation of danger. Fear of death and childbirth complications stemming from previous traumatic childbirth and traumatic experience in the community was rampant. Husbands\u2019 and in-laws\u2019 disappointment in a girl infant constituted a strong sociocultural component of fear. Women without fear gave reasons of faith, social belonging and trust in either traditional or modern childbirth practice, past positive experience of childbirth and the desire for social status associated with children (I). Women in areas with a matrilineal past who were often unassisted during childbirth experienced little fear (I, II).", "A graded negative association was found between the perceived authority of the woman in childbirth and the level of biomedical training of staff. Women who had their questions answered and requests met during childbirth had 83% higher probability to perceive their own authority and women who reported skin-to-skin contact/ newborn in arms 28% higher probability of not fearing birth (III). Three main themes explained their sense of authority: (i) \u2018Being at the centre\u2019; (ii) \u2018A sense of belonging\u2019 and (iii) \u2018Husband\u2019s role in childbirth\u2019. Authority was experienced primarily among women within the traditional childbirth sector and among women with a matrilineal past (II, III). Women who had previously been able to follow their own individual choice in matters of childbirth were six times more likely to plan a future childbirth in the same location (IV).  Conclusions: Women's perceived own authority during childbirth is decreasing in the context of Safe Motherhood and the expansion of modern delivery care. This is an important reason why women underutilize professional care. Antenatal care has an important role in reducing fear of childbirth including that of institutional childbirth and in strengthening a couple in welcoming a female infant. Yemeni women\u2019s low utilization of modern delivery care should be seen in the context of their low autonomy and status. We call for cooperation between modern and traditional childbirth care. In areas of Yemen with a matrilineal past women\u2019s choice of place of delivery does not seem to be influenced by a need for authority during childbirth.", "https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/handle/10616/46740", "and thesis in full: https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10616/46740/Thesis_Annica_Kempe.pdf", "(** B H K)", "The Suffering Beyond the Stalemate: The Humanitarian Context in Serwah District", "The people of Serwah in Marib governorate have suffered through more than four years of conflict, with an active frontline that continues to divide their land and block the main road through the district.

From the local perspective, a key reason for the prolonged fighting in the district is that Serwah\u2019s natives are split amongst themselves and divided between the main conflicting parties. The confrontations are concentrated in the center of the district, mainly in the Serwah sub-district [3] where Serwah\u2019s central market (\u0633\u0648\u0642] (1] is located, and across the spacious Sarawah plain.", "As a result of the conflict, local infrastructure has suffered significant damage. Residential homes and property have been subjected to thousands of indiscriminate airstrikes and shells, reducing public life to a near standstill.

In addition to heightened petrol prices and general instability, ten vital roads were damaged, causing the disruption of traffic and forcing people to use alternative rough roads.", "As for Serwah, it was reported that there are around 3,476 families who are internally displaced within the district itself. Out of the IDPs in Serwah, it is estimated that around 85 percent of them are from Serwah and other district in Marib, while around 15 percent are from outside Marib.14 Residents of Serwah who have become displaced outside of the district have primarily relocated to Sana'a governorate, the capital secretariat (Sana\u2019a city), and neighbouring Marib districts such as Marib city.", "Displaced people in Serwah live in unorganized gatherings.", "Before the fighting reached Serwah in 2015, locals were mainly dependent on farming, raising livestock, trade and government jobs as livelihood sources.

In addition to this, there is a need for greater treatment and support for those suffering from chronic diseases, critical cases, and those in need of a specialist in mental and neurological disorders. Conditions such as asthma, malaria, cholera, dengue fever, and skin diseases continue to develop among the displaced community, as well as disabilities resulting from the war among children.", "Part 4: Conclusion", "This report has aimed to address one of the gaps in publicly accessible research on the humanitarian impact of the conflict in Yemen at the local level, especially as it relates to internal displacement. The population of Serwah is not as large as other areas of the country that are more frequently featured in news headlines, and like other areas with small populations it is often dropped to the bottom of the priority list for international humanitarian assistance.

The aim of this study was to explore FOC in a high maternal mortality setting in the Arab region, Yemen.", "METHODS:", "A multi-stage (stratified-purposive-random) sampling process was used. We interviewed 220 women with childbirth experience in urban/rural Yemen. Answers to the question 'Were you afraid of giving birth?' were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.", "RESULTS:", "Women perceived childbirth as a place of danger. Fear of death and childbirth complications stemming from previous traumatic childbirth and traumatic experience in the community was rampant. Husbands' and in-laws' disappointment in a girl infant constituted a strong sociocultural component of FOC. Women's perception of living in tension 'between worlds' of tradition and modernity reinforced fear of institutional childbirth. Women without FOC gave reasons of faith, social belonging and trust in either traditional or modern childbirth practice, past positive experience of childbirth and the desire for social status associated with children.", "CONCLUSIONS:", "The numerous maternal and infant deaths have a strong impact on women's FOC. Antenatal care has an important role in reducing fear including that of institutional childbirth and in strengthening a couple in welcoming a female infant.

Authority was experienced primarily among women within the traditional childbirth sector although a general complaint among women delivered by trained medical staff was the loss of own authority.", "KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:", "these findings show that women's authority during childbirth is decreasing in the context of Safe Motherhood and the expansion of modern delivery care. This is likely to be an important reason why women underutilise professional care. Acquisition of knowledge from the traditional childbirth sector regarding how women exercise authority to facilitate childbirth would constitute an asset to skilled delivery and Safe Motherhood.

Women's social and demographic background played no role for their perceived own authority at birth.", "CONCLUSIONS:", "This paper argues that supporting Yemeni women to exercise their own authority during childbirth would significantly facilitate their ability to give birth successfully and with personal satisfaction. In a country where women are routinely disempowered, their personal empowerment at birth is very important to them. Skilled birth assistants often, in women's perceptions, work against their personal power and authority, most especially MDs but also midwives.

Though maternal mortality still lies at the heart of maternal health indicators, there is a growing concern about the impact of mental and behavioural health on maternal health outcomes. World Health Organization (WHO) is proposing a stronger focus on mental health for an integrated delivery of services for Maternal- and Child Health (MCH).  Aim: The overall aim is to gain insight into the experience of Yemeni women of modern and traditional care during childbirth, their perceived mental status and health care seeking patterns. The focus of the thesis is on women\u2019s reproductive mental health in the context of culture and health care systems.  Methods:", "A multi-stage (stratified-purposive-random) sampling process was used. Two hundred and twenty women with childbirth experience in five governorates \u2013 Aden, Lahej, Hadramout, Taiz and Hodeidah \u2013 were interviewed by means of a semi-structured questionnaire. Half of the women lived in urban, half in rural areas. Questions concerned the most recent pregnancy and childbirth (location, attendance and perceived quality); postpartum period; women\u2019s empowerment and social and demographic information. A pre-test of the questionnaire was carried out in Taiz.", "Interviews were made by two Yemeni nurse-midwives and two medical doctors, one of whom was an obstetrician-gynaecologist, and one a Sudanese nurse-midwife. All women approached for an interview were initially explained about the purpose of the study and asked whether they would agree to participate. Interviews lasted for 1-3 hours. All performed interviews were discussed daily among team members.", "Results: A large majority of women perceived childbirth as a situation of danger. Fear of death and childbirth complications stemming from previous traumatic childbirth and traumatic experience in the community was rampant. Husbands\u2019 and in-laws\u2019 disappointment in a girl infant constituted a strong sociocultural component of fear. Women without fear gave reasons of faith, social belonging and trust in either traditional or modern childbirth practice, past positive experience of childbirth and the desire for social status associated with children (I). Women in areas with a matrilineal past who were often unassisted during childbirth experienced little fear (I, II).", "A graded negative association was found between the perceived authority of the woman in childbirth and the level of biomedical training of staff. Women who had their questions answered and requests met during childbirth had 83% higher probability to perceive their own authority and women who reported skin-to-skin contact/ newborn in arms 28% higher probability of not fearing birth (III). Three main themes explained their sense of authority: (i) \u2018Being at the centre\u2019; (ii) \u2018A sense of belonging\u2019 and (iii) \u2018Husband\u2019s role in childbirth\u2019. Authority was experienced primarily among women within the traditional childbirth sector and among women with a matrilineal past (II, III). Women who had previously been able to follow their own individual choice in matters of childbirth were six times more likely to plan a future childbirth in the same location (IV).  Conclusions: Women's perceived own authority during childbirth is decreasing in the context of Safe Motherhood and the expansion of modern delivery care. This is an important reason why women underutilize professional care. Antenatal care has an important role in reducing fear of childbirth including that of institutional childbirth and in strengthening a couple in welcoming a female infant. Yemeni women\u2019s low utilization of modern delivery care should be seen in the context of their low autonomy and status. We call for cooperation between modern and traditional childbirth care. In areas of Yemen with a matrilineal past women\u2019s choice of place of delivery does not seem to be influenced by a need for authority during childbirth.", "https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/handle/10616/46740", "and thesis in full: https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10616/46740/Thesis_Annica_Kempe.pdf", "(** B H K)", "The Suffering Beyond the Stalemate: The Humanitarian Context in Serwah District", "The people of Serwah in Marib governorate have suffered through more than four years of conflict, with an active frontline that continues to divide their land and block the main road through the district.

From the local perspective, a key reason for the prolonged fighting in the district is that Serwah\u2019s natives are split amongst themselves and divided between the main conflicting parties. The confrontations are concentrated in the center of the district, mainly in the Serwah sub-district [3] where Serwah\u2019s central market (\u0633\u0648\u0642] (1] is located, and across the spacious Sarawah plain.", "As a result of the conflict, local infrastructure has suffered significant damage.

In addition to this, there is a need for greater treatment and support for those suffering from chronic diseases, critical cases, and those in need of a specialist in mental and neurological disorders.

We interviewed 220 women with childbirth experience in urban/rural Yemen. Answers to the question 'Were you afraid of giving birth?' were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.", "RESULTS:", "Women perceived childbirth as a place of danger. Fear of death and childbirth complications stemming from previous traumatic childbirth and traumatic experience in the community was rampant. Husbands' and in-laws' disappointment in a girl infant constituted a strong sociocultural component of FOC. Women's perception of living in tension 'between worlds' of tradition and modernity reinforced fear of institutional childbirth. Women without FOC gave reasons of faith, social belonging and trust in either traditional or modern childbirth practice, past positive experience of childbirth and the desire for social status associated with children.", "CONCLUSIONS:", "The numerous maternal and infant deaths have a strong impact on women's FOC. Antenatal care has an important role in reducing fear including that of institutional childbirth and in strengthening a couple in welcoming a female infant.

Authority was experienced primarily among women within the traditional childbirth sector although a general complaint among women delivered by trained medical staff was the loss of own authority.", "KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:", "these findings show that women's authority during childbirth is decreasing in the context of Safe Motherhood and the expansion of modern delivery care. This is likely to be an important reason why women underutilise professional care. Acquisition of knowledge from the traditional childbirth sector regarding how women exercise authority to facilitate childbirth would constitute an asset to skilled delivery and Safe Motherhood.

In a country where women are routinely disempowered, their personal empowerment at birth is very important to them. Skilled birth assistants often, in women's perceptions, work against their personal power and authority, most especially MDs but also midwives.
