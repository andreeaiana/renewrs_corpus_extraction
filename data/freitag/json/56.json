It does so through the lens of domestic politics by tracing the monarchy\u2019s response to the opposition in both time periods, and how this was informed by the different regional contexts of the 1960s and the 2011 Arab Spring.", "The study argues that Saudi Arabia enhanced its own institutions, including a pan-Islamic ideological justification to rule, in response to aggression from Egypt and its revolutionary pan-Arab ideology. This contributed to a relatively cautious Saudi foreign policy in response to regional threats from Arab nationalism, along with a strategy of co-optation within the kingdom. In contrast, the non-ideological threat embodied in the Arab Spring posed a more existential threat to Saudi legitimacy. The new crown prince manipulated the regime\u2019s sense of anxiety from this to consolidate power through further scapegoating of the Shi\u2019a minority, exacerbated tensions with foreign rivals, and, most blatantly, the 2015 intervention in Yemen.", "Comparing Saudi foreign policy changes from the Arab nationalist period to the post-Arab Spring period, this volume is a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in political science, history, international relations and Middle East politics.", "https://www.routledge.com/Saudi-Interventions-in-Yemen-A-Historical-Comparison-of-Ontological-Insecurity/Tynan/p/book/9780367456382", "cp1 Am wichtigsten / Most important", "(** B P)", "Where is Saudi Arabia Headed in Yemen?", "The scope and scale of Saudi Arabia\u2019s military intervention in Yemen has to be seen in the broader context of the revolution in its foreign policy in the wake of the ascendancy of Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in early 2015.[1]In the short period between 2015 and 2018, the previously cautious Kingdom launched a brutal war in Yemen, led the blockade of its neighbor Qatar,[2]initiated a diplomatic spat with Canada,[3]kidnapped the Lebanese prime minister and forced him to resign on television, and assassinated a prominent critic, Jamal Khashoggi, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.", "It is striking, however, that MBS has not launched comparably reckless foreign policy adventures since late 2018, and that his aggressive and ambitious rhetoric has toned down. Why is that the case? Arguably, there has been a growing realization that the country\u2019s foreign policy since 2015 was increasingly costly, and that this was unsustainable in the long term. How this learning process came about, however, is not clear: whether MBS truly understood the costs of his actions and concluded he needed to slow down his ambitions remains a matter of debate, as is the role that his father, King Salman, and senior advisors played in moderating the impetuous Crown Prince\u2019s ambitions.", "The sudden shift in Saudi foreign policy has partially reversed since the assassination of Khashoggi in October 2018, but this does not imply a return to the pre-2015 status quo. Indeed, adventurist regional endeavors continue, even if new wars have not been launched: the diplomatic and economic embargo of Qatar and the war in Yemen, in particular, show little sign of abating.", "What does this partial recalibration mean for Saudi involvement in Yemen? Riyadh wants to remain involved in Yemen, but it also wants to lower the costs of its intervention. This is, of course, far easier said than done, and Saudi Arabia has yet to devise and implement a strategy that would allow it to do so.", "Riyadh, first, cannot afford to withdraw completely from Yemen, given the geo-strategic importance of the latter to the former and the 1,800 kilometer border they share; it is rather looking to recalibrate its role. Riyadh still perceives, in particular, that its support is vital to ensure the survival of the loose and heteroclite coalition supporting President Hadi, which includes the Islah party, some remnants of the General People\u2019s Congress (the party of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh), and a diverse array of tribal militias, business interests, and loyalist units in the military and security services. Riyadh believes, correctly, that its sudden withdrawal would lead to the weakening or the disintegration of this coalition, which would benefit the Houthis \u2013 and their external benefactor, Iran.", "At the same time, Riyadh wants to reduce the costs of its intervention in Yemen. It has come to realize, in particular, that the financial and military costs are unsustainable[4]and that the diplomatic costs \u2013 in terms of its image in the West, both in the media and in political circles \u2013 are mounting. This, in turn, complicates its ability to leverage its close partnerships with Western governments, which it views as essential to its security. This could become especially true in the case of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most important relationship, that with the United States, where frustration with Riyadh is gradually mounting.", "Devising and implementing this recalibration is a very hard balancing act to strike, one which Riyadh has failed to achieve so far. Engineering such a change in policy, first, is complex, and made more difficult by Saudi\u2019s weak bureaucratic and institutional capacity. Second, perhaps the greatest challenge for Saudi strategy in Yemen is Hadi himself. Riyadh has completely tied its fortunes to him; as president of the internationally-recognized government, he leads the coalition that Saudi Arabia supports to counter the Houthis and Iran. Hadi is, as such, indispensable. He is, however, weak, corrupt, and ineffective. This poses a major constraint on Riyadh\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives in Yemen.", "A related problem for Riyadh is that the anti-Houthi front is weak and fragmented, with Hadi as its leader in name only, further reducing its leverage in talks with the Houthis.", "Looking forward, Riyadh will continue, and probably intensify its efforts to unify and build up the anti-Houthi front, but prospects for success are low given its fragmentation and Riyadh\u2019s absence of alternatives to Hadi.

Gender-based violence was reported to have increased by 70% within five months of the escalation of the conflict in 2015, and as of 2017 two thirds of girls were married by the age of 18. UNICEF has reported that children as young as eight have been married off as families turn to extreme survival measures in the face of acute poverty.", "Six years into the war, women must conform to the demands of the religious extremists who have risen to power through the chaos. In some areas, burqas have become universal, whilst women are subject to the rules of mahram, that is, needing a man\u2019s permission to leave the house and being escorted by male relatives when outside. Women\u2019s rights organisations report the targeting of women who speak out against the Houthis, the armed Shia movement in control of the capital Sana\u2019a and elsewhere. Women face widespread arbitrary detention, and torture and sexual violence in prison, whilst lives have been destroyed by baseless prostitution charges.", "Deteriorating access to water and sanitation services as a result of the conflict has also had a disproportionate impact on women across the country. It is primarily women that shoulder the burden of collecting water, women that are most at risk of violence when they do so, women that are most in need of private and hygienic toilets and women that suffer from a lack of sanitary products.", "Water infrastructure has been a casualty of Yemen\u2019s conflict, whether through direct targeting, ancillary damage caused by urban warfare, the cumulative impact of years without maintenance or the breakdown of water and sewage systems caused by a lack of fuel and other inputs. Such damage has direct environmental impacts, as sewage goes untreated and pollution is not dealt with.", "Forthcoming research by CEOBS into the impact of the conflict on water resources in Yemen has uncovered instances of the streets of Sana\u2019a flooding with sewage; untreated sewage being used to irrigate crops; treatment plants failing to process waste; and effluent overflowing from treatment plants onto land and into the sea. Coupled with the lack of fresh water for drinking and washing faced by 17.8 million people, this has contributed to a public health catastrophe: Yemen\u2019s cholera epidemic is the worst in recorded history whilst dengue fever and other diseases are on the march.", "The impacts of a society subjected to extreme levels of disease are felt disproportionately by women. It is pregnant and breastfeeding women, particularly those that are malnourished, who are most at risk of death. Women\u2019s role as caregivers becomes more physically and emotionally taxing as diseases spread, and according to the United Nations Population Fund, in Yemen they may face increased exposure to cholera as a result of this role. Yet they may also be less able to seek medical care if they become ill due to having less power over decision making and less control over household resources.", "This analysis, however, fails to recognise the role of women as agents of positive change. Women are at the forefront of efforts to fight the spread of disease.

It does so through the lens of domestic politics by tracing the monarchy\u2019s response to the opposition in both time periods, and how this was informed by the different regional contexts of the 1960s and the 2011 Arab Spring.", "The study argues that Saudi Arabia enhanced its own institutions, including a pan-Islamic ideological justification to rule, in response to aggression from Egypt and its revolutionary pan-Arab ideology. This contributed to a relatively cautious Saudi foreign policy in response to regional threats from Arab nationalism, along with a strategy of co-optation within the kingdom. In contrast, the non-ideological threat embodied in the Arab Spring posed a more existential threat to Saudi legitimacy. The new crown prince manipulated the regime\u2019s sense of anxiety from this to consolidate power through further scapegoating of the Shi\u2019a minority, exacerbated tensions with foreign rivals, and, most blatantly, the 2015 intervention in Yemen.", "Comparing Saudi foreign policy changes from the Arab nationalist period to the post-Arab Spring period, this volume is a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in political science, history, international relations and Middle East politics.", "https://www.routledge.com/Saudi-Interventions-in-Yemen-A-Historical-Comparison-of-Ontological-Insecurity/Tynan/p/book/9780367456382", "cp1 Am wichtigsten / Most important", "(** B P)", "Where is Saudi Arabia Headed in Yemen?", "The scope and scale of Saudi Arabia\u2019s military intervention in Yemen has to be seen in the broader context of the revolution in its foreign policy in the wake of the ascendancy of Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in early 2015.[1]In the short period between 2015 and 2018, the previously cautious Kingdom launched a brutal war in Yemen, led the blockade of its neighbor Qatar,[2]initiated a diplomatic spat with Canada,[3]kidnapped the Lebanese prime minister and forced him to resign on television, and assassinated a prominent critic, Jamal Khashoggi, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.", "It is striking, however, that MBS has not launched comparably reckless foreign policy adventures since late 2018, and that his aggressive and ambitious rhetoric has toned down. Why is that the case? Arguably, there has been a growing realization that the country\u2019s foreign policy since 2015 was increasingly costly, and that this was unsustainable in the long term. How this learning process came about, however, is not clear: whether MBS truly understood the costs of his actions and concluded he needed to slow down his ambitions remains a matter of debate, as is the role that his father, King Salman, and senior advisors played in moderating the impetuous Crown Prince\u2019s ambitions.", "The sudden shift in Saudi foreign policy has partially reversed since the assassination of Khashoggi in October 2018, but this does not imply a return to the pre-2015 status quo. Indeed, adventurist regional endeavors continue, even if new wars have not been launched: the diplomatic and economic embargo of Qatar and the war in Yemen, in particular, show little sign of abating.", "What does this partial recalibration mean for Saudi involvement in Yemen? Riyadh wants to remain involved in Yemen, but it also wants to lower the costs of its intervention. This is, of course, far easier said than done, and Saudi Arabia has yet to devise and implement a strategy that would allow it to do so.", "Riyadh, first, cannot afford to withdraw completely from Yemen, given the geo-strategic importance of the latter to the former and the 1,800 kilometer border they share; it is rather looking to recalibrate its role. Riyadh still perceives, in particular, that its support is vital to ensure the survival of the loose and heteroclite coalition supporting President Hadi, which includes the Islah party, some remnants of the General People\u2019s Congress (the party of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh), and a diverse array of tribal militias, business interests, and loyalist units in the military and security services. Riyadh believes, correctly, that its sudden withdrawal would lead to the weakening or the disintegration of this coalition, which would benefit the Houthis \u2013 and their external benefactor, Iran.", "At the same time, Riyadh wants to reduce the costs of its intervention in Yemen. It has come to realize, in particular, that the financial and military costs are unsustainable[4]and that the diplomatic costs \u2013 in terms of its image in the West, both in the media and in political circles \u2013 are mounting. This, in turn, complicates its ability to leverage its close partnerships with Western governments, which it views as essential to its security. This could become especially true in the case of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most important relationship, that with the United States, where frustration with Riyadh is gradually mounting.", "Devising and implementing this recalibration is a very hard balancing act to strike, one which Riyadh has failed to achieve so far. Engineering such a change in policy, first, is complex, and made more difficult by Saudi\u2019s weak bureaucratic and institutional capacity. Second, perhaps the greatest challenge for Saudi strategy in Yemen is Hadi himself. Riyadh has completely tied its fortunes to him; as president of the internationally-recognized government, he leads the coalition that Saudi Arabia supports to counter the Houthis and Iran. Hadi is, as such, indispensable. He is, however, weak, corrupt, and ineffective. This poses a major constraint on Riyadh\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives in Yemen.", "A related problem for Riyadh is that the anti-Houthi front is weak and fragmented, with Hadi as its leader in name only, further reducing its leverage in talks with the Houthis.", "Looking forward, Riyadh will continue, and probably intensify its efforts to unify and build up the anti-Houthi front, but prospects for success are low given its fragmentation and Riyadh\u2019s absence of alternatives to Hadi.
