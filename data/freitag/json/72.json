Despite many hailing Mukalla\u2019s April 2016 \u201cliberation\u201d by U.S.-backed forces on the ground as a major success in the struggle against terrorism in Yemen, the reality is that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula remains a grave threat in the war-torn country for a host of reasons, including a willingness by some of Washington\u2019s allies to coordinate with the group in their fight against Iran-allied Houthis.", "From Washington\u2019s vantagepoint, AQAP\u2019s capture of an airport, the port in Mukalla, and an oil export terminal constituted an unacceptable development in the Yemeni crisis. Thus, in no small part due to pressure from the U.S., Abu Dhabi, and its allies in Yemen concentrated on removing AQAP from power in Mukalla. The Emiratis amassed a force of 12,000 Yemeni and Emirati fighters, primarily made up of tribal fighters from Hadramaut, to expel AQAP from Mukalla.", "That the U.S.-backed forces successfully took back Mukalla rapidly enabled the UAE to better position itself vis-\u00e0-vis Washington and other Western capitals as a rising power in the Arab world that carries out its responsibilities in the global \u201cwar on terror.\u201d", "Since AQAP\u2019s loss of Mukalla, U.S.-backed Emirati operations against the terrorist group have also led to AQAP losing significant power", "Over the past three years, AQAP has benefited from its established financial networks and ability to recruit disenfranchised Yemenis who support the group\u2019s Salafist ideology. AQAP\u2019s success in maintaining its foothold in Yemen since losing Mukalla has been largely attributable to the organization\u2019s projection of a more moderate image in the eyes of Yemenis", "Another factor which has boded well for AQAP has been the Saudi-led military coalition\u2019s focus on combating Houthis", "From an American standpoint, the gravest threats to U.S. national security out of Yemen are the local al-Qaeda and ISIS branches.", "Looking ahead, the threat that AQAP poses not only to Yemenis, but to global security at large will remain real.

It is true that AQAP occupied Mukalla and part of Hadramaut in 2015-2016. In 2016 a deal was done and Al Qaeda moved from Mukalla and UAE forces moved in. Although it was claimed that there was a fight, there was credible evidence that this was a deal as fighters moved out in an organised manner with their equipment - and money presumably - to other governates like Shabwa. The graves of the alleged 800 dead fighters have never materialised.", "A detailed investigation by AP asserted that many of the previous AQ fighters from Mukalla were then recruited by UAE for brigades such as Shabwa elite forces, Giant Brigades, Security Belt, although a denial by UAE said that these were fighters forced to align with AQ who then defected to support the UAE militias. Either way, these new UAE paid fighters were all from very conservative Sunni backgrounds, the same background that recruits AQAP members. This story gives the narrative from the perspective of the Saudi coalition in its entirety.", "So it's not surprising that AQAP are in Yemen - they never left, although the hard core Al Qaeda have been attacked by UAE funded militias - and US drones - since then with some success. Interestingly recent rumours suggest that these AQAP fighters have recently been pushed back by Houthi militias, in places like Al Dhalea and Al Bayda, and they are now approaching Aden again four years after they were expelled. The Houthis have far more motivation to defeat AQAP than the UAE paid militias who are after all Al Qaeda lookalikes by many accounts.
