Many have been trapped in conflict-affected locations and are at risk for living in damaged shelters and unfinished buildings. Their degree of resilience and positive coping mechanism have reduced due to the protracted nature of the conflict. The ability to provide their basic household needs have decreased due to the economic recession that left hundred thousands of Yemeni people unemployed. Salaries for health facility staff, teachers and other public sector workers go increasingly unpaid, leaving 1.25 million state employees and their 6.9 million dependents or nearly 30 per cent of the population without an income at a time of shortages and rising prices. As of 1 August 2018, the Task Force for Population Movement (TFPM) which is a Technical Working Group to the Inter-Cluster Coordination Mechanism (ICCM) has identified, 2,331,264 internally displaced persons (IDPs) (388,544 households) who have been displaced due to conflict and natural disasters since March 2015, dispersed across 22 governorates. The current number of displaced persons represent 7% of total Yemeni population based on Yemen\u2019s pre-crisis population of 28,923,127 individuals. The majority of IDPs are living with host. For the same period, the TFPM has identified 1,012,464 returnees (168,744 households), across 22 governorates. The majority of returnees are residing in their original house of habitual residence. Immediate emergency assistance for newly displaced families remains a significant challenge as the majority of displaced families tend to live in precarious situations for several weeks before basic emergency shelter and NFI assistance can be provided. Majority of IDPs in Yemen are living with host families but displacement already lasted longer than anticipated, resources run out and the capacity of host families is extremely stretched. In other hand, over course of the year, an increasing number of IDPs families who are living in rented accommodation admitted to owing their landlords large sums of money for rent, others left their rented accommodation out of shame or were forced out by the landlords and ended up residing in IDPs hosting sites or host families.", "https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/shelternficccm-cluster-information-management-strategy-yemen-2018-2019", "cp5 Nordjemen und Huthis / Northern Yemen and Houthis", "Siehe / Look at cp1", "(A H P)", "Film: Summer Nasser: Was a guest at Al-Jazeera English discussing WFP statement regarding Houthi corruption of aid in Yemen.", "https://www.facebook.com/1066147805/posts/10215512617543008/", "(* A P)", "Baha'is fear for members excluded from Yemen prisoner swap", "The Baha'i community voiced fresh concern Monday for members of the faith detained under Yemen's Huthi rebels, saying that prisoners have been excluded from a swap planned with the government.", "But the Baha'is, whose religion is opposed by Iran's Shiite clerical regime, said the rebels had balked at including six Baha'is who had been on the list.", "Instead, the community said it has learned that the rebels were pressing for an abrupt appeals hearing to take place Tuesday on Hamed bin Haydara, a Baha'i who has been sentenced to death, and for quick verdicts against 24 other detained Baha'is who could also face the death penalty on religious grounds.", "https://www.france24.com/en/20181231-bahais-fear-members-excluded-yemen-prisoner-swap = https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6542845/Bahais-fear-members-excluded-Yemen-prisoner-swap.html", "and also by the Bahai organization: https://www.bic.org/news/houthis-push-abrupt-court-hearings-sanaa-endangering-bahais-yemen", "(A P)", "Internal Houthi conflict results in injury of a Houthi leader and death of his brother at Hajjah", "Local sources reported Monday that undersecretary of Hajjah governorate appointed by the Houthis Taha El Hamzi, was wounded and his brother shot dead by gunmen in Mabeen in Hajjah Directorate.", "The sources noted that Hamzi was seriously injured and taken to Republican hospital after he was shot upon by other Houthi gunmen in the directorate, and this comes among the internal conflict between the group leaders over royalties and backdrop of recruitments.", "http://almasdaronline.com/articles/162664", "(A P)", "Dhamar security arrests 60 recruits for aggression during December", "The Dhamar security arrested on Sunday 60 recruits of Saudi- paid mercenaries to fight Yemenis during December.", "An official told Saba that \" the mercenaries' recruits they were set through their reluctance to and from the camps of aggression\" the army was arrested a mercenary who \"admitted that he had been lured into financial promises\"", "While the other mercenaries' recruits were arrested after they returned from Saudi' camp after their recognition the dangerously of commission of aggression crimes against Yemen.", "http://www.sabanews.net/en/news521015.htm", "(* B P)", "Houthis in Yemen: Who are they and why is everybody out to get them?", "It is important to note that this conflict began not as a Sunni-Shiite divison, but a battle between different Yemeni groups for turf, influence and power.", "But there are sectarian overtones.
