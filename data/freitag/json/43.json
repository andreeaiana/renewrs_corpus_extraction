The most basic elements of health care are not available. \u2022 The government's apparent failure to deal with the recent natural disaster as well as its disregard for the lives and dignity of the people, contrary to what was apparent in the government\u2019s direct attention in Yemen's Marib.", "The legitimacy continued to systematically backup the Brotherhood militias\u2019 move towards Shabwa, Abyan and Aden. \u2022 The Yemeni government\u2019s forces violated and arrested public members in Shabwa, Abyan, Hadhramaut Valley, Al-Mahra and Socotra \u2022 According to the Riyadh Agreement, the current government is considered illegitimate and the politics of the agreement must be implemented. The Yemeni government blocked all ways to implement that part of the agreement, while the Arab coalition did not challenge them. \u2022 The Southern Transitional Council reiterates that it sent several letters to the leadership of the Arab Coalition to inform them that the leadership of the STC must return to Aden. The most recent letter sent was on Sunday when the leadership of the STC informed the brothers in Saudi Arabia during a televised meeting between the President of the Southern Transitional Council and His Excellency the Ambassador of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques to the Republic of Yemen.
