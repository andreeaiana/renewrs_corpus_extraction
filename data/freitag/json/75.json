Every single household in Yemen is bearing the repercussions of this interruption.", "Starvation Is a Weapon of War", "Many employees left their government jobs and switched to the private sector in order to make a living. However, teachers and employees in the education sector were forced to continue working due to the threat of dismissal and replacement. They were hit the hardest by the suspension of salaries, since this sector is not considered as a profit-generating sector that can provide employees with small sums of money every once in a while, like in other sectors.", "The central bank was moved from Sana\u2019a to Aden, and the fates of thousands of employees in the public sector were thrust into the unknown, particularly for those living in areas under the control of Ansar Allah armed group (Houthis). The government did not treat them as citizens and did not pay them their salaries, nor did the Houthis consider themselves responsible for paying their salaries.", "Ahmed says: \u201cWe continue working in order to keep our job and undertake our obligations.

Hence, we can do our jobs and at the same time work elsewhere to cover our own expenses.\u201d Pride and Humanitarian Assistance", "Prior to the war, Ahmed considered it shameful for university professors to receive aid, which was distributed as humanitarian aid to the needy and poor during the holy month of Ramadan and religious events. Now, he is standing in line, waiting for his turn to get his share. He says: \u201cYour respect for yourself declines in the face of your poor ability to cover your needs. All you think about is meeting and covering your needs and not saving your image. You give up appearances, status and prestige in return for providing the basics of living.\u201d", "This barrier began to disappear over time, and he started demanding the right to receive these food baskets provided by international organizations as assistance to those affected by the conflict. Receiving assistance is not humiliating or shameful but rather it\u2019s an attempt to remedy an emergency humanitarian situation.", "Travelling in order to Receive a Salary", "The Hadi authority has adopted a particular procedure to pay the salaries of employees in the areas under the control of the Houthi group, which stipulates the necessity of traveling to Aden governorate with the status of \u201cdisplaced person\u201d in order to receive their salaries. This requires great efforts and is dangerous, especially with the presence of security points and the security belt that prevents citizens from the northern areas from entering Aden.", "Houses that Are Falling Apart", "Employees are left with two empty pockets in front of their children, unable to provide basic meals or to provide the value of medical service, in case of an illness. They also face the threat of losing their places of residence and families after being unable to pay the rent.", "Many families could not bear the consequences of the salary cuts. Many households did not survive this stormy tide of need, destitution and disability. The economic conditions quickly forced numerous families to disintegrate and break up. People spend dozens of years trying to build their families, but in light of such a crisis, they are unable to protect or maintain them and can\u2019t meet their requirements and their responsibilities.", "Ahmed lost his wife because of his deteriorating financial state. His heart aches when he remembers her and he says: \u201cI lost my wife because of our financial situation. We were separated as a result of these circumstances and I was unable to provide the requirements and undertake my obligations. She didn\u2019t ask for much but I couldn\u2019t even provide that. Family visits also became very limited due to salary interruptions and the sharp increase in transportation costs.\u201d", "The lives of many employees have been destroyed, and it is impossible for them to return to their old lives even if they are paid.

The indication from these discussions is that the meetings were another opportunity missed. A best-case scenario emerging from the talks would have been that hundreds of thousands of civil servants would receive regular salaries for the first time in three years, helping to bring an income to millions of their family members in the midst of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Meaningful progress in Amman would also have helped kickstart the Stockholm Agreement; instead, the lack of progress may now paralyze UN-mediated peace efforts.", "Despite the stakes, the two delegations never met face-to-face during the talks \u2013 though they smoked shisha together one evening. UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths never showed up. Indeed, Griffiths had initially scheduled just one day for the talks, which were extended to three days only after requests for the extension from both delegations.", "The primary issue dividing the parties was what to do with revenues from the three ports around Hudaydah City \u2013 Ras Issa, Saleef, and Hudaydah, the busiest ports in Yemen and the primary entry points for the country\u2019s commercial and humanitarian shipments.", "The Stockholm Agreement stipulated that revenues from the ports should be deposited in the Central Bank of Yemen\u2019s (CBY) Hudaydah branch, and used to contribute to the payment of civil servant salaries in Hudaydah and \u201cthroughout Yemen.\u201d Going into the talks in Amman, the government position was that the CBY in Hudaydah should be completely under the authority of the CBY in Aden. This entailed rescinding all Houthi appointments since 2014, and moving forward, the Hudaydah branch would have to follow all directives from, and report all activities to, the Aden CBY. The Yemeni government also wanted all state revenues from Hudaydah governorate \u2013 not just from the ports \u2013 submitted to the Hudaydah CBY. These would be used to pay the salaries of all public sector workers in Hudaydah, based on the 2014 payroll \u2013 meaning the removal of any Houthi-appointed personnel. Any remaining revenues were to be allocated to pay salaries of health and education staff elsewhere in Yemen that are not currently being paid. As a starting point the Houthi delegation wanted to discuss all state revenues in Yemen, with the submission of revenues from Hudaydah port to the authority of the Aden CBY being contingent on all civil servant salaries in the country being paid.", "The revenues from Hudaydah\u2019s ports were a central motivator for the Saudi-led military coalition \u2013 which backs the internationally recognized Yemeni government \u2013 launching its campaign to take the city last year, regardless of its claims of weapons smuggling through the ports. While the Stockholm Agreement would mean the Houthis giving up the ports, there were several counterbalancing factors from their perspective: full civil servant salary payments would allow them to gain revenue through taxes and increased economic activity in their areas, especially considering that most civil servants live in Houthi-controlled territory. Houthi forces also avoided a battle for Hudaydah, which would have been costly in manpower and money.", "Signing a deal on Hudaydah revenues without an agreement to pay civil servant salaries country-wide would have meant only revenue losses for the Houthis, and thus was something they weren\u2019t willing to do. For exactly that reason, the government of Yemen wanted the ports\u2019 revenues to be used to pay civil servant salaries in Hudaydah only, rather than the whole of Yemen \u2013 as this would deprive the Houthis of an avenue to recover lost revenues. Rather, the Yemeni government delegation advocated a gradual approach of paying the salaries in Hudaydah first and then financing Hudaydah public services, with the disbursement of any remaining revenue to be agreed on at a later stage.", "So after three days of UN staff running back and forth between the delegations, there were no concessions \u2013 By Spencer Osberg and Hannah Patchett", "http://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/7433", "Remark by Judith Brown: The crisis in Yemen is essentially an economic one - the country's economy ceased to function four years ago and salaries of civil servants have not been paid for three years, since Hadi moved the Central Bank. Yet Martin Griffiths just didn't turn up to a crucial meeting in Amman on the payment of salaries. The article also states that the Houthis handed over support of the port of Hodeida to Houthi supporters. I don't know why anyone thinks this is strange. They were hardly likely to hand over the port to someone who supported Hadi and his government - that would have been akin to surrender. And so, after the three day meeting I can report that nothing whatsoever has changed.", "https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157608800823641", "My comment: This article shows how the Hadi government tried to eat the cake alone: They wanted to get 100 % control by negotiations.

This entailed rescinding all Houthi appointments since 2014, and moving forward, the Hudaydah branch would have to follow all directives from, and report all activities to, the Aden CBY. The Yemeni government also wanted all state revenues from Hudaydah governorate \u2013 not just from the ports \u2013 submitted to the Hudaydah CBY. These would be used to pay the salaries of all public sector workers in Hudaydah, based on the 2014 payroll \u2013 meaning the removal of any Houthi-appointed personnel. Any remaining revenues were to be allocated to pay salaries of health and education staff elsewhere in Yemen that are not currently being paid. As a starting point the Houthi delegation wanted to discuss all state revenues in Yemen, with the submission of revenues from Hudaydah port to the authority of the Aden CBY being contingent on all civil servant salaries in the country being paid.", "The revenues from Hudaydah\u2019s ports were a central motivator for the Saudi-led military coalition \u2013 which backs the internationally recognized Yemeni government \u2013 launching its campaign to take the city last year, regardless of its claims of weapons smuggling through the ports. While the Stockholm Agreement would mean the Houthis giving up the ports, there were several counterbalancing factors from their perspective: full civil servant salary payments would allow them to gain revenue through taxes and increased economic activity in their areas, especially considering that most civil servants live in Houthi-controlled territory. Houthi forces also avoided a battle for Hudaydah, which would have been costly in manpower and money.", "Signing a deal on Hudaydah revenues without an agreement to pay civil servant salaries country-wide would have meant only revenue losses for the Houthis, and thus was something they weren\u2019t willing to do. For exactly that reason, the government of Yemen wanted the ports\u2019 revenues to be used to pay civil servant salaries in Hudaydah only, rather than the whole of Yemen \u2013 as this would deprive the Houthis of an avenue to recover lost revenues. Rather, the Yemeni government delegation advocated a gradual approach of paying the salaries in Hudaydah first and then financing Hudaydah public services, with the disbursement of any remaining revenue to be agreed on at a later stage.", "So after three days of UN staff running back and forth between the delegations, there were no concessions \u2013 By Spencer Osberg and Hannah Patchett", "http://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/7433", "Remark by Judith Brown: The crisis in Yemen is essentially an economic one - the country's economy ceased to function four years ago and salaries of civil servants have not been paid for three years, since Hadi moved the Central Bank. Yet Martin Griffiths just didn't turn up to a crucial meeting in Amman on the payment of salaries. The article also states that the Houthis handed over support of the port of Hodeida to Houthi supporters. I don't know why anyone thinks this is strange.
