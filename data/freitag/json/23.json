The purpose of identifying patterns that constitute serious violations, and of analyzing the kinds of procedures and practices leading to such attacks, is to assess whether their recurrence makes further, similar attacks more likely.", "GLAN has identified specific problems in Coalition practices which give rise to routine violations of IHL and show that, far from being \u201cisolated incidents,\u201d such attacks are part of an ongoing trend.
