In the twenty-first century, worthy victims are generally Westerners who are killed or severely injured in terrorist attacks (e.g. victims of 9/11) while unworthy victims are non-Westerners who are killed by Western military operations (e.g. Yemeni civilians.)", "Essentially, atrocities committed by the US are far less likely to be covered than those committed by other, non-Western nations.", "And while major Western news outlets may cover deadly airstrikes in Yemen, they largely avoid discussing US and Saudi military relations. An Associated Press piece, for example, covered a Saudi coalition airstrike that killed 13 Yemeni civilians earlier this month, but failed to mention that the US government provides weapons and intelligence to the coalition.", "With that in mind, reporting on Yemen requires American journalists to confront the dark reality that the US is complicit in war crimes against the Yemenis.

As Jehan Hakim, the chair of the Yemeni Alliance Committee, puts it, \u201cThe same hand we're asking to feed Yemen is the same hand that is helping bomb them.\u201d", "On June 15, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres removed the U.S.-Saudi military coalition, which has been waging war in Yemen for more than five years, from an international blacklist of states and armed groups responsible for killing and maiming children, in a huge P.R. win for Saudi Arabia. He cited a supposed decrease in child killings, even as he acknowledged the coalition was responsible for killing 222 children last year, 171 of them from bombings\u2014a number that certainly does not include the toll of famine and disease outbreaks (including Covid-19) worsened by the war and blockade.

On June 2, the UN co-hosted a virtual donors\u2019 summit with Saudi Arabia to raise money for humanitarian relief in Yemen, which is being devastated by Covid-19, in large part because the U.S.-Saudi coalition has decimated its hospital system, and a Saudi-led blockade is cutting off critical medical supplies. Guterres, who made the recent decision to scrub Saudi Arabia from the blacklist, gave the opening remarks for the event. \u201cI thank the Government of Saudi Arabia for co-hosting this pledging event, and for your continued commitment to humanitarian aid to the people of Yemen,\u201d he said.", "Saudi Arabia was the highest donor at the event, pledging a token $500 million in aid, the exact amount of money Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, spent on his personal yacht. The United States pledged $225 million, or less than the cost of three of the numerous F35 fighter jets the U.S. military has purchased from Lockheed Martin.", "These numbers also pale in comparison to the value of the arms the United States ships to Saudi Arabia\u2014amounting to at least $3 billion in 2019\u2014despite calls for a global embargo due to Saudi atrocities in Yemen. Yet the event, the global equivalent of a GoFundMe campaign for Yemen aid, fell $1 billion short of its goal, or roughly the equivalent of only two of the Leonardo Da Vinci paintings bin Salman bought for himself in 2017.", "El-Tayyab says he is concerned about whether the U.S. aid that was pledged will be sent to Houthi-held areas, where a majority of Yemen\u2019s population lives. \u201cWe don't know if the aid is going to get to north Yemen,\u201d he said.", "Shireen Al-Adeimi, Yemeni-American anti-war activist, board member of Just Foreign Policy, and frequent contributor to In These Times, agreed with El-Tayyab\u2019s explanation for why the coalition was removed from the UN blacklist. According to Al-Adeimi, the UN lives in fear that the very countries responsible for unleashing humanitarian crises will withdraw funding for humanitarian aid.", "One could argue that the UN is forced to perform ethical gymnastics, due the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt withdrawal of tens of millions of dollars in assistance from USAID, the World Food Programme\u2019s 50% cut to aid in Houthi-held areas, and threats to close critical UN-run food aid programs in Yemen, all as Covid-19 is battering the country. The UN has no choice, therefore, but to do what any fundraiser must do: cavort with unsavory donors, and flatter the wealthy in hopes that they will keep the organization afloat.", "But the UN is not just a passive observer of the Yemen war: By shielding the United States and Saudi Arabia from even the most modest political consequences for a war that has unleashed the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, it has used its institutional power to enable this onslaught. In 2015, just six months into the war, Saudi Arabia launched a diplomatic campaign to prevent the UN from launching a human rights investigation, abetted by the silence of the Obama administration.

The disturbing imagery can also traumatize the investigators who must comb through and watch the footage. Now an initiative that will soon mount a challenge in the UK court system is trialing a machine-learning alternative. It could model a way to make crowdsourced evidence more accessible and help human rights organizations tap into richer sources of information.", "The initiative, led by Swansea University in the UK along with a number of human rights groups, is part of an ongoing effort to monitor the alleged war crimes happening in Yemen and create greater legal accountability around them. In 2017, the platform Yemeni Archive began compiling a database of videos and photos documenting the abuses. Content was gathered from thousands of sources\u2014including submissions from journalists and civilians, as well as open-source videos from social-media platforms like YouTube and Facebook\u2014and preserved on a blockchain so they couldn\u2019t be tampered with undetected.", "Along with the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), a nonprofit that sues states for human rights violations, the investigators then began curating evidence of specific human rights violations into a separate database and mounting legal cases in various domestic and international courts. \u201cIf things are coming through courtroom accountability processes, it\u2019s not enough to show that this happened,\u201d says Yvonne McDermott Rees, a professor at Swansea University and the initiative\u2019s lead. \u201cYou have to say, \u2018Well, this is why it\u2019s a war crime.\u2019 That might be \u2018You\u2019ve used a weapon that\u2019s illegal,\u2019 or in the case of an air strike, \u2018This targeted civilians\u2019 or \u2018This was a disproportionate attack.\u2019\u201d", "In this case, the partners are focusing on a UK-manufactured cluster munition, the BLU-63. The use and sale of cluster munitions, explosive weapons that spray out smaller explosives on impact, are banned by 108 countries, including the UK.", "So they decided to develop a machine-learning system to detect all instances of the BLU-63 in the database. But images of BLU-63s are rare precisely because they are illegal, which left the team with little real-world data to train their system. As a remedy, the team created a synthetic data set by reconstructing 3D models of the BLU-63 in a simulation.", "While Harvey is still in the middle of generating more training examples\u2014he estimates he will need over 2,000\u2014the existing system already performs well: over 90% of the videos and photos it retrieves from the database have been verified by human experts to contain BLU-63s", "Human experts would still need to verify the footage after the system filters it, but the gain in efficiency changes the game for human rights organizations looking to mount challenges in court.", "\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at, for example, the targeting of hospitals, having one video that shows a hospital being targeted is strong; it makes a case,\u201d says Jeff Deutch, the lead researcher at Syrian Archive, who also launched Yemeni Archive. \u201cBut if you can show hundreds of videos of hundreds of incidents of hospitals being targeted, you can see that this is really a deliberate strategy of war. When things are seen as deliberate, it becomes more possible to identify intent. And intent might be something useful for legal cases in terms of accountability for war crimes.\u201d", "As the Yemen collaborators prepare to submit their case, evidence on this scale will be particularly relevant.

On June 2, the UN co-hosted a virtual donors\u2019 summit with Saudi Arabia to raise money for humanitarian relief in Yemen, which is being devastated by Covid-19, in large part because the U.S.-Saudi coalition has decimated its hospital system, and a Saudi-led blockade is cutting off critical medical supplies. Guterres, who made the recent decision to scrub Saudi Arabia from the blacklist, gave the opening remarks for the event. \u201cI thank the Government of Saudi Arabia for co-hosting this pledging event, and for your continued commitment to humanitarian aid to the people of Yemen,\u201d he said.", "Saudi Arabia was the highest donor at the event, pledging a token $500 million in aid, the exact amount of money Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, spent on his personal yacht.

Yet the event, the global equivalent of a GoFundMe campaign for Yemen aid, fell $1 billion short of its goal, or roughly the equivalent of only two of the Leonardo Da Vinci paintings bin Salman bought for himself in 2017.", "El-Tayyab says he is concerned about whether the U.S. aid that was pledged will be sent to Houthi-held areas, where a majority of Yemen\u2019s population lives. \u201cWe don't know if the aid is going to get to north Yemen,\u201d he said.", "Shireen Al-Adeimi, Yemeni-American anti-war activist, board member of Just Foreign Policy, and frequent contributor to In These Times, agreed with El-Tayyab\u2019s explanation for why the coalition was removed from the UN blacklist.

The UN has no choice, therefore, but to do what any fundraiser must do: cavort with unsavory donors, and flatter the wealthy in hopes that they will keep the organization afloat.", "But the UN is not just a passive observer of the Yemen war: By shielding the United States and Saudi Arabia from even the most modest political consequences for a war that has unleashed the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, it has used its institutional power to enable this onslaught.

Now an initiative that will soon mount a challenge in the UK court system is trialing a machine-learning alternative. It could model a way to make crowdsourced evidence more accessible and help human rights organizations tap into richer sources of information.", "The initiative, led by Swansea University in the UK along with a number of human rights groups, is part of an ongoing effort to monitor the alleged war crimes happening in Yemen and create greater legal accountability around them. In 2017, the platform Yemeni Archive began compiling a database of videos and photos documenting the abuses. Content was gathered from thousands of sources\u2014including submissions from journalists and civilians, as well as open-source videos from social-media platforms like YouTube and Facebook\u2014and preserved on a blockchain so they couldn\u2019t be tampered with undetected.", "Along with the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), a nonprofit that sues states for human rights violations, the investigators then began curating evidence of specific human rights violations into a separate database and mounting legal cases in various domestic and international courts. \u201cIf things are coming through courtroom accountability processes, it\u2019s not enough to show that this happened,\u201d says Yvonne McDermott Rees, a professor at Swansea University and the initiative\u2019s lead. \u201cYou have to say, \u2018Well, this is why it\u2019s a war crime.\u2019 That might be \u2018You\u2019ve used a weapon that\u2019s illegal,\u2019 or in the case of an air strike, \u2018This targeted civilians\u2019 or \u2018This was a disproportionate attack.\u2019\u201d", "In this case, the partners are focusing on a UK-manufactured cluster munition, the BLU-63. The use and sale of cluster munitions, explosive weapons that spray out smaller explosives on impact, are banned by 108 countries, including the UK.", "So they decided to develop a machine-learning system to detect all instances of the BLU-63 in the database. But images of BLU-63s are rare precisely because they are illegal, which left the team with little real-world data to train their system. As a remedy, the team created a synthetic data set by reconstructing 3D models of the BLU-63 in a simulation.", "While Harvey is still in the middle of generating more training examples\u2014he estimates he will need over 2,000\u2014the existing system already performs well: over 90% of the videos and photos it retrieves from the database have been verified by human experts to contain BLU-63s", "Human experts would still need to verify the footage after the system filters it, but the gain in efficiency changes the game for human rights organizations looking to mount challenges in court.", "\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at, for example, the targeting of hospitals, having one video that shows a hospital being targeted is strong; it makes a case,\u201d says Jeff Deutch, the lead researcher at Syrian Archive, who also launched Yemeni Archive. \u201cBut if you can show hundreds of videos of hundreds of incidents of hospitals being targeted, you can see that this is really a deliberate strategy of war. When things are seen as deliberate, it becomes more possible to identify intent.

In the twenty-first century, worthy victims are generally Westerners who are killed or severely injured in terrorist attacks (e.g. victims of 9/11) while unworthy victims are non-Westerners who are killed by Western military operations (e.g. Yemeni civilians.)", "Essentially, atrocities committed by the US are far less likely to be covered than those committed by other, non-Western nations.", "And while major Western news outlets may cover deadly airstrikes in Yemen, they largely avoid discussing US and Saudi military relations. An Associated Press piece, for example, covered a Saudi coalition airstrike that killed 13 Yemeni civilians earlier this month, but failed to mention that the US government provides weapons and intelligence to the coalition.", "With that in mind, reporting on Yemen requires American journalists to confront the dark reality that the US is complicit in war crimes against the Yemenis.

As Jehan Hakim, the chair of the Yemeni Alliance Committee, puts it, \u201cThe same hand we're asking to feed Yemen is the same hand that is helping bomb them.\u201d", "On June 15, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres removed the U.S.-Saudi military coalition, which has been waging war in Yemen for more than five years, from an international blacklist of states and armed groups responsible for killing and maiming children, in a huge P.R. win for Saudi Arabia. He cited a supposed decrease in child killings, even as he acknowledged the coalition was responsible for killing 222 children last year, 171 of them from bombings\u2014a number that certainly does not include the toll of famine and disease outbreaks (including Covid-19) worsened by the war and blockade.

On June 2, the UN co-hosted a virtual donors\u2019 summit with Saudi Arabia to raise money for humanitarian relief in Yemen, which is being devastated by Covid-19, in large part because the U.S.-Saudi coalition has decimated its hospital system, and a Saudi-led blockade is cutting off critical medical supplies. Guterres, who made the recent decision to scrub Saudi Arabia from the blacklist, gave the opening remarks for the event. \u201cI thank the Government of Saudi Arabia for co-hosting this pledging event, and for your continued commitment to humanitarian aid to the people of Yemen,\u201d he said.", "Saudi Arabia was the highest donor at the event, pledging a token $500 million in aid, the exact amount of money Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, spent on his personal yacht. The United States pledged $225 million, or less than the cost of three of the numerous F35 fighter jets the U.S. military has purchased from Lockheed Martin.", "These numbers also pale in comparison to the value of the arms the United States ships to Saudi Arabia\u2014amounting to at least $3 billion in 2019\u2014despite calls for a global embargo due to Saudi atrocities in Yemen. Yet the event, the global equivalent of a GoFundMe campaign for Yemen aid, fell $1 billion short of its goal, or roughly the equivalent of only two of the Leonardo Da Vinci paintings bin Salman bought for himself in 2017.", "El-Tayyab says he is concerned about whether the U.S. aid that was pledged will be sent to Houthi-held areas, where a majority of Yemen\u2019s population lives. \u201cWe don't know if the aid is going to get to north Yemen,\u201d he said.", "Shireen Al-Adeimi, Yemeni-American anti-war activist, board member of Just Foreign Policy, and frequent contributor to In These Times, agreed with El-Tayyab\u2019s explanation for why the coalition was removed from the UN blacklist. According to Al-Adeimi, the UN lives in fear that the very countries responsible for unleashing humanitarian crises will withdraw funding for humanitarian aid.", "One could argue that the UN is forced to perform ethical gymnastics, due the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt withdrawal of tens of millions of dollars in assistance from USAID, the World Food Programme\u2019s 50% cut to aid in Houthi-held areas, and threats to close critical UN-run food aid programs in Yemen, all as Covid-19 is battering the country. The UN has no choice, therefore, but to do what any fundraiser must do: cavort with unsavory donors, and flatter the wealthy in hopes that they will keep the organization afloat.", "But the UN is not just a passive observer of the Yemen war: By shielding the United States and Saudi Arabia from even the most modest political consequences for a war that has unleashed the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, it has used its institutional power to enable this onslaught. In 2015, just six months into the war, Saudi Arabia launched a diplomatic campaign to prevent the UN from launching a human rights investigation, abetted by the silence of the Obama administration.

The disturbing imagery can also traumatize the investigators who must comb through and watch the footage. Now an initiative that will soon mount a challenge in the UK court system is trialing a machine-learning alternative. It could model a way to make crowdsourced evidence more accessible and help human rights organizations tap into richer sources of information.", "The initiative, led by Swansea University in the UK along with a number of human rights groups, is part of an ongoing effort to monitor the alleged war crimes happening in Yemen and create greater legal accountability around them. In 2017, the platform Yemeni Archive began compiling a database of videos and photos documenting the abuses. Content was gathered from thousands of sources\u2014including submissions from journalists and civilians, as well as open-source videos from social-media platforms like YouTube and Facebook\u2014and preserved on a blockchain so they couldn\u2019t be tampered with undetected.", "Along with the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), a nonprofit that sues states for human rights violations, the investigators then began curating evidence of specific human rights violations into a separate database and mounting legal cases in various domestic and international courts. \u201cIf things are coming through courtroom accountability processes, it\u2019s not enough to show that this happened,\u201d says Yvonne McDermott Rees, a professor at Swansea University and the initiative\u2019s lead. \u201cYou have to say, \u2018Well, this is why it\u2019s a war crime.\u2019 That might be \u2018You\u2019ve used a weapon that\u2019s illegal,\u2019 or in the case of an air strike, \u2018This targeted civilians\u2019 or \u2018This was a disproportionate attack.\u2019\u201d", "In this case, the partners are focusing on a UK-manufactured cluster munition, the BLU-63.

But images of BLU-63s are rare precisely because they are illegal, which left the team with little real-world data to train their system. As a remedy, the team created a synthetic data set by reconstructing 3D models of the BLU-63 in a simulation.", "While Harvey is still in the middle of generating more training examples\u2014he estimates he will need over 2,000\u2014the existing system already performs well: over 90% of the videos and photos it retrieves from the database have been verified by human experts to contain BLU-63s", "Human experts would still need to verify the footage after the system filters it, but the gain in efficiency changes the game for human rights organizations looking to mount challenges in court.", "\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at, for example, the targeting of hospitals, having one video that shows a hospital being targeted is strong; it makes a case,\u201d says Jeff Deutch, the lead researcher at Syrian Archive, who also launched Yemeni Archive. \u201cBut if you can show hundreds of videos of hundreds of incidents of hospitals being targeted, you can see that this is really a deliberate strategy of war.
