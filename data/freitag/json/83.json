Dabei wird er zumeist als ein Krieg zwischen Sunniten mit der saudisch/emiratisch-gef\u00fchrten Milit\u00e4rkoalition auf der einen Seite und Schiiten mit dem Iran auf der anderen Seite dargestellt. Jemenitische Akteure werden bei dieser Darstellung oft nur als Marionetten ihrer ausl\u00e4ndischen Schutzmacht verstanden. Eine andere weitverbreitete und sehr vereinfachte Sichtweise beschreibt den Krieg als einen Konflikt zwischen den Huthi-Rebellen und der international anerkannten Hadi-Regierung, die aus Sanaa geputscht wurde. Dieses Bild des Krieges wurde erst zuletzt bei den UN-vermittelten Friedensverhandlungen in Stockholm im Dezember 2018 best\u00e4tigt, da nur diese zwei Konfliktparteien an den Gespr\u00e4chen teilnahmen.

Der Krieg hat die bereits vor 2015 bestehende Fragmentierung des Landes noch weiter vorangetrieben und mit ihr auch die St\u00e4rkung lokaler Macht- und Regierungsstrukturen, die eine R\u00fcckkehr zu zentralistischen Staatsstrukturen, wie sie vor 2011 \u00fcblich waren, unm\u00f6glich macht.", "Die Huthi-regierten Gebiete", "Der S\u00fcd\u00fcbergangsrat", "Nach der Befreiung Adens griff Pr\u00e4sident Hadi besonders auf Unterst\u00fctzung von S\u00fcdjemeniten zur\u00fcck, setzte sie in hohe staatliche \u00c4mter oder als Soldaten an der Front ein.

It was the UAE that initiated the military operation in the South in April 2016, using local paramilitary forces trained and equipped by the UAE military to liberate almost the entire Arabian Sea coast in Yemen from the control of Ansar al-Sharia, a group loyal to the leaders of the banned terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).", "The terrorists\u2019 imperious claims in the South, which had pledged loyalty to the AC, shocked the local population, which had been fighting radical Islamists consistently for over 15 years. The establishment of quasi-administrative bodies in these cities by the Islamists was accompanied by violence against the local Sunni population.

In early 2016, the informal leader of the party\u2019s military wing, General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, was appointed deputy commander and vice president of Yemen. That appointment led to an emerging rift in the AC between the pro-Saudi and pro-UAE wings. The Yemenis\u2019 attitude towards the general and the Al-Islah party determined, to a certain extent, the subsequent shifts in political sentiment both in the North and in the South.", "Although the UAE-led antiterrorist military operation in the southern port cities was bloodless, and the militants were allowed to leave the cities and move to their camps with their weapons to avoid civilian casualties, it clearly showed that the UAE and the majority of the population of the South would not tolerate AQAP terrorists or even Muslim Brothers from the Al-Islah party in this part of the country.", "In May 2017, the Southern Transitional Council (STC) was established in the South, headed by Aidarus al-Zoubaidi who had been dismissed the day before by President Hadi as governor of the Aden province.

This is just part of a larger ball of contradictions that had existed in Yemen even before the foreign intervention, but have now reemerged in a new shape as a result of the disastrous war. Neighboring powers are vying in pursuit of their geopolitical interests in Yemen, and this fact keeps interfering with local developments, upsetting the balance of power between Yemen\u2019s centers of political influence located in Aden and Sana'a.", "Iran\u2019s involvement in the Yemen conflict as the military campaign enters its fifth year is highly doubtful.", "The absolute dominance of Ansarullah, a movement 50% comprised of the former ruling party GPC, in the the coalition regime established in Sana'a in August 2016 and having proved resilient since then, is equally dubious.

Still, gains in the south of the country could not be forfeited, nor could the UAE's local allies be abandoned. That is why Abu Dhabi decided to allow the secessionist Southern Transitional Council (STC) to execute a coup against the Yemeni president and his government.", "It is quite likely that the battle for Aden and its strategic facilities is only the beginning of a series of showdowns elsewhere whose ultimate aim is to remove all vestiges of Hadi's control in the south.", "Whither Saudi Arabia?", "Saudi Arabia's position on what happened in Aden in early August has been rather murky.

Jemenitische Akteure werden bei dieser Darstellung oft nur als Marionetten ihrer ausl\u00e4ndischen Schutzmacht verstanden. Eine andere weitverbreitete und sehr vereinfachte Sichtweise beschreibt den Krieg als einen Konflikt zwischen den Huthi-Rebellen und der international anerkannten Hadi-Regierung, die aus Sanaa geputscht wurde.
