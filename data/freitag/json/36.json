The country\u2019s many conflicts are interconnected and can no longer be separated by clear divisions between external and internal actors and events. Throughout 2019, the Houthis and the Government of Yemen made little headway towards either a political settlement or a conclusive military victory. In a continuation from 2018, the belligerents continued to practice economic warfare: using economic obstruction and financial tools as weapons to starve opponents of funds or materials. Profiteering from the conflict is endemic.", "In the south, the Government of Yemen confronted the military challenges posed by the forces affiliated with the southern transitional council. The vice-president of the council, Hani Ali Salem Binbrek, initiated a conflict when he used force to remove what little authority the Government of Yemen held in Aden. Ongoing clashes on the Abyan and Shabwah borders and the limited progress in the implementation of the Riyadh Agreement indicate that the situation in the south remains volatile.", "In the north, the Houthis continued to consolidate their political and military control, in particular through their pervasive intelligence services, which include both the preventative security and a new security and intelligence bureau. Houthi forces also engaged in the brutal suppression of tribal opposition and political dissent. The Panel of Experts on Yemen has identified a Houthi network involved in the repression of women who oppose the Houthis, including through the use of sexual violence, headed by the director of the Sana\u2019a-based criminal investigation department, Sultan Zabin.", "Throughout most of 2019, the Houthi forces continued and intensified their aerial attacks on Saudi Arabia. In addition to the previously known weapon systems, they used a new type of Delta-design uncrewed aerial vehicle and a new model of land attack cruise missile. The Panel has investigated the high-profile attack on 14 September 2019 on the Saudi Aramco facilities in Abqaiq and Khurays and finds that, despite claims to the contrary, the Houthi forces are unlikely to be responsible for the attack, as the estimated range of the weapon systems used does not allow for a launch from Houthi-controlled territory. Nevertheless, a number of other attacks on Saudi Arabia can clearly be attributed to the Houthi forces.", "Following the attack in September, the Houthis made a public offer to establish a ceasefire. The ceasefire has been broadly complied with. Both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis now publicly state that they are engaged in discussions, while the launching of longer-range uncrewed aerial vehicles and missile strikes by Houthi forces against Saudi Arabia has abated.", "With regard to potential violations of the targeted arms embargo, the Panel observes two major trends: the first is the transfer of commercially available parts, such as uncrewed aerial vehicle engines, servo actuators and electronics, which are exported from industrialized countries through a network of intermediaries to the Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, where they are integrated into locally assembled uncrewed aerial vehicles and waterborne improvised explosive devices; the second is the continued reception by Houthi forces of military support in the form of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, anti-tank guided missiles and more sophisticated cruise missile systems. Some of those weapons have technical characteristics similar to arms manufactured in the Islamic Republic of Iran. For both commercial parts and weapons, the main smuggling route seems to run overland from Oman and the southern coast of Yemen, through territory controlled by the Government of Yemen, towards Sana\u2019a. The high-profile seizure on 25 November 2019 of a dhow carrying anti-tank guided missiles and other missile parts in the Arabian Sea indicates that, as in previous years, sea transport continues to play a role in potential violations of the targeted arms embargo.", "The absence of the rule of law and oversight in Yemen allows for the illicit enrichment of a small number of predatory entrepreneurs, some of whom hold official posts in public institutions. Within this context, and with the lack of any accountability, national wealth and external aid are increasingly either diverted or lost owing to corrupt practices by officials of the Government of Yemen and the Houthis. As tools of economic warfare, the parties have created obstacles to block the financing of the importation of goods and caused delays for the vessels carrying them to Yemen.", "The Panel found indications of illicit enrichment through the manipulation of foreign exchange rates by the Central Bank of Yemen in Aden. The Panel found that the Houthis were involved in cases of violations of asset freeze measures by allowing the diversion of frozen assets and public funds through false contracts for the benefit of individuals acting on behalf of Abdulmalik al-Houthi (YEi.004). Saleh Mesfer Alshaer, a Houthi general in charge of logistics, was also instrumental in the diversion of funds unlawfully appropriated from Houthi opponents.", "Violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law continued to be widely committed by all parties in Yemen with impunity. The air strikes conducted by the Coalition to Support Legitimacy in Yemen, led by Saudi Arabia, and the indiscriminate use of explosive ordnance, including landmines, by Houthi forces continue to disproportionately affect civilians and civilian infrastructures. Arbitrary arrest and detention, enforced disappearances, ill-treatment and the torture of detainees continue to be conducted by the Government of Yemen, Saudi Arabia, the Houthis and the forces affiliated with the United Arab Emirates. In Aden, the absence of the rule of law allows armed groups affiliated with the United Arab Emirates to conduct such violations and to operate outside the control of the Government of Yemen. Threats and acts of violence against humanitarians, as well as administrative hurdles to the delivery of assistance, are increasing in Houthi-controlled areas.", "https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/letter-dated-27-january-2020-panel-experts-yemen-addressed-president-security-council-0", "and letter in full: https://undocs.org/en/S/2020/326", "My comment: And now all sides of the conflict will start cherrypicking.", "(** B K P)", "After Another \u2018Coup\u2019 in Aden, Which Government in Yemen Is \u2018Legitimate\u2019?", "Meanwhile, the powerless deposed president can only sit and watch as he loses control to the Houthis and the STC. Indeed, he has spent most of the war far away and safely in Riyadh, only having made six visits to Yemen in five years. At times, his Saudi patrons have even put him under house arrest and have barred him from traveling to Yemen out of fear of his safety. Indeed, even a couple of weeks before the latest STC coup in Aden five scholars with an expert knowledge about Yemen contracted by the Sana\u2019a Center for Strategic Studies were unanimous in the fact that Hadi has negligible effective power. Still, in the press his government \u2013 even though it is hardly functioning \u2013 religiously remains quoted as \"legitimate\" and \"internationally recognized.\"", "The Houthis: \"rebels\" and \"Iranian proxies,\" but no government", "The Houthis, on the other hand, who have retained governance over large swaths of the most populous regions of the country for five years, in the press do not even get the courtesy of being described as in power of a government \u2013 let alone a \"legitimate\" one. They are strenuously called \"rebels\" fighting an insurgency against the sovereign government. True, since Hussein al-Houthi founded the movement in the early 2000s, that is indeed what they have done for years, first against the Saleh and then the Hadi regime. But when they overthrew Hadi and took over the capital, they also took over the government and have governed to the extent that this is possible given the circumstances of war and international isolation and blockade. In that capacity, they have ruled over 70-80% of Yemen\u2019s population for years. Even when Saleh terminated the fragile alliance, turned his forces against the Houthis and was killed by Houthi fighters in 2017, the group did not only manage to maintain its power, but tens of thousands of its supporters rallied the streets to celebrate Saleh\u2019s death.", "It should be noted that the Houthis took power in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and have ruled the country undemocratically ever since. But like so many dictators in the region, the West supported Saleh\u2019s autocratic rule for 33 years without protest, nor are any of the countries within the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis democratic. Most are hereditary monarchies who rule without any pretense of democracy, while some, like Egypt, are as much of a sham democracy as the Hadi regime itself. The war can thus not be justified as a Wilsonian crusade to bring democracy to the Middle East.", "Additionally, it can be argued that the Houthis have an appalling ruling record and are guilty of war crimes, too.", "But again, the same atrocities have been committed by Western allies.", "If not for humanitarian or democratic reasons, what then is the war really about? The answer can be found in the media\u2019s other common description of the Houthis, that of \"Iranian proxies.\" Indeed, underneath the pretext of reinstalling Hadi, rolling back Iran\u2019s alleged influence in Yemen is the real raison d\u2019\u00eatre on which the Saudi-led war on the people of Yemen is predicated. American and Gulf officials endlessly claim that their classified intelligence demonstrates that Iran has deployed elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) forces on the ground and are shipping weapons to the Houthis. Yet, they have never provided any shred of evidence so that these claims can be publicly falsified. Just as in the cases of WMDs in Iraq, Iran\u2019s nuclear bomb and Syria\u2019s gas attacks, the public is to belief these officials on their word.", "In fact, on a few occasions the most mainstream of publications have themselves debunked the unfounded notion that the Houthis are merely Iranian proxies with no real agenda or agency of their own. The Washington Post, Foreign Policy, Brookings Institute and Chatham house have all pointed out that Iranian support to the Houthis is marginal at best and have highlighted political grievances rooted in anti-imperialism at the origins of the movement instead.", "Western policy makers like to describe conflicts in the Middle East as exclusively sectarian-based in order to downplay the role of Western and Israeli interventionism in the region. Based on the teachings of Bernard Lewis and Samuel Huntington, neoconservative pundits claim that the \"clash of civilizations\" thesis proofs that Islam is an inherently violent religion and that unsurmountable Shi\u2019a-Sunni divisions lay at the foundations of conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere. They fail to explain, however, that the common denominator in all these conflicts is that Shi\u2019as and Sunnis largely coexisted peacefully up until foreign intervention brought conflict and stoked sectarian strife. Even then, very much like the mislabeled \"Religious Wars\" of early modern Europe, opportunistic and strategic cross-religious alliances are made all the time.", "That is not to say that religion does never play any part in Middle Eastern conflicts, but rather that it usually serves a secondary role of catalysator", "Recently, the Trump administration has started to backtrack on the claim that it is fighting Iran in Yemen. Brian Hook, the hawkish special representative for Iran, for instance, was in September of last year still claiming that Iran was \"controlling and deploying\" the Houthis as a \"terror front.\" In December, however, he admitted that \"Iran clearly does not speak for the Houthis.\" With that admission, any accuse in favor of this devastating war on the Yemeni people falls flat on its face.", "How to stop the suffering?", "With the war having all but decimated the health care system of what was already the Middle East\u2019s poorest country, many commentators have sounded the alarm about the damage the incipient coronavirus outbreak in the country could wreak. Yet, however alarming, Sana\u2019a-based journalist Nasser Arrabyee reminds us that the main threat to the Yemeni people remains the Saudi-led destruction visited upon the country by the blockade, fighting and bombing. This, more than anything else, prevents Yemenis from arming themselves against the virus", "Both the Hadi and Houthi regimes claim to be Yemen\u2019s legitimate government. After five years of war, neither have succeeded in taking over the whole country and imposing sovereignty. But only the Houthis have managed to retain their dominance over a vast majority of the population, possibly because of their perceived record of anti-corruption and battling foreign meddling. Meanwhile, failure to pay salaries to Gulf-backed mercenaries was cited as one of the core reasons for the STC\u2019s latest coup in Aden, demonstrating that lavish Gulf funds have artificially inflated the demand for resistance against the Houthis. Thus, neither the STC nor the Hadi regime enjoy unambivalent consent of the governed in the sparsely populated south, where al-Qaeda and ISIS militants keep filling the power vacuum. Conversely, the Houthis never came close to losing their control of Sana\u2019a even without major funds and under pains of international isolation. In short, only the Houthis have been able to maintain a monopoly of violence over large swaths of the population for a considerable time. Therefore, though the desirability of their rule can be debated, only they can be said to be in control of a functioning state in the most basic, Weberian sense of the word.", "Recognizing this fact is the first step in ending one of the greatest humanitarian disasters of the 21st century. As the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s most powerful allies, the Western powers hold the key to end the war.", "As this article has made clear, the truth is the reverse. Strong Western condemnations of the inhumane blockade, the halting of arms sales to Gulf countries, a general departure from the Western-Gulf alliance and opening diplomatic relations with the Houthi regime are some of the steps that could embolden the strained negotiations and speed up the pressure on the Saudi-led coalition to admit defeat and come to terms with a settlement.

Independent journalism hasn\u2019t existed in Sana\u2019a since the Houthis seized power in September 2014 and media organizations began shutting down, leaving only hand-picked sectarian propaganda outlets in their wake. Along with the closures, 10 journalists were abducted in 2015, jailed and tortured. Such a climate of fear breeds self-censorship among those left standing \u2014 play by the rules or lose your job, your freedom, your dignity, and perhaps even your life \u2014 and silences important stories like those of the abused women.", "The climate was only poisoned more on April 11, when a deeply flawed \u201ctrial\u201d concluded for the abducted journalists, whose charges included spying for the anti-Houthi military coalition. Four of them \u2014 Abdel-Khaleq Amran, Akram al-Walidi, Hareth Hamid and Tawfiq al-Mansouri \u2014 were sentenced to death, and six others convicted with them were ordered released on time served. By month\u2019s end, only one, Salah al-Qaedi, was free. The journalists had been forcibly disappeared for six months, tortured, denied medical treatment and deprived of their right to due process. The Houthis lack any legal or constitutional legitimacy to run courts, meaning carrying out the sentences would amount to extrajudicial killings.", "Houthi authorities are well aware of the threat independent journalism is to a regime that relies on corruption, intimidation, violence and abuse \u2014 though their animosity runs surprisingly deep. They have shown reckless disregard toward journalists again and again, including when they held Abdullah Kabil and Yousef Alaizry captive in 2015 in a building that had been repeatedly bombed only for them to be buried in its rubble on its next hit. Furthermore, since the war began, the Houthis have exchanged prisoners with Al-Qaeda, released hundreds of enemy forces\u2019 fighters and, most recently, offered an exchange for five Saudi soldiers including a pilot shot down over Al-Jawf in February, but have rejected every call for the release of the journalists now on death row, rebuffing foreign and domestic mediation attempts.

A major point of contention dealt with the future makeup of Yemen. Southerners aligned with the Hadi government backed plans to transform Yemen into a six-region federation, which was proposed in February 2014 and rejected at the time by most Southern Movement factions. Meanwhile, the STC was adamant about the secession of southern Yemen. A second factor in the tensions is historical and linked to the intense rivalry between two political-social groups.", "The STC benefitted in 2017 from the momentum of the southern cause, and used that to solidify itself politically, expand its geographic influence, build its internal structure to function both as a party and to mimic a state, and increase its military capacity. However, at this point, it remained a de facto power and did not attempt to leverage its strength into becoming a ruling authority like the Houthi movement did in northern Yemen.", "In January 2018, clashes broke out between the government and STC-aligned forces in Aden, but there were several reasons the \u201csouthern-southern\u201d division stopped short of reaching the point of no return.", "On the surface, it seemed that the situation exploded after the Houthi assassination of Abu al-Yamama, commander of the Security Belt forces in Aden and an iconic Southern Movement and resistance leader. The missile attack that killed him, and recriminations by STC figures that Islah had collaborated with the Houthis, sparked a chain of events that quickly had Hadi government soldiers and STC-allied forces turning on each other, with the former eventually ejected from the city. On a deeper level, however, the UAE\u2019s decision earlier in the year to begin withdrawing troops from Yemen was the main impetus behind the escalation of events. The STC\u2019s rivals and their respective regional backers \u2014 the Houthis and Iran, Hadi and Saudi Arabia, Islah and Qatar and Turkey \u2014 wanted to preempt a power vacuum in southern Yemen and put an end to Abu Dhabi\u2019s policy of empowering its local allies, which had dramatically bolstered the STC\u2019s military capabilities over the years. Meanwhile, the STC leadership pressed hard in response to the targeting of its commanders, attempting to grab territory before the fragile strategic balance in the south was disturbed.", "In the end, the Houthis succeeded in pitting their rivals against one another.", "Synchronizing political and security measures would represent the magical solution needed for the Riyadh Agreement to succeed, but Riyadh has struggled to activate the political components of the agreement and has instead focused its efforts on security arrangements \u2014 an approach the STC views as directly targeting it and empowering its rivals.", "The radical change in the balance of power in southern Yemen in favor of Riyadh and its allies deprived the STC of the space to maneuver that it had when the UAE was present there, and it undermined its political ability to curb the Hadi government\u2019s obstructive behavior. Instead of accepting self-erosion, it made the dramatic announcement of self-rule across southern Yemen. The STC\u2019s call was not welcomed in most southern governorates, but it succeeded in shaking up the political stalemate surrounding the Riyadh Agreement.", "Saudi Arabia has a real interest in seeing the Riyadh Agreement is implemented, and this is why the agreement is still standing despite the STC\u2019s escalation and the Hadi government\u2019s obstruction. The agreed upon power-sharing framework may help avoid a repeat of the full-blown descent into open violence witnessed in August of last year.

The content of the STC\u2019s self-rule statement appears to be mostly directed against Saudi Arabia, and reflects the deteriorating relations between the group and Riyadh. The text, which spoke about conspiracies, noted that wages had not been paid to the council\u2019s military and security forces; frontline areas had not been supplied with weapons, ammunition and food; and support for the wounded and families of martyrs had stopped. Following the UAE pullout from Yemen and the signing of the Riyadh Agreement, the Saudis assumed complete control, meaning these responsibilities fell under their purview.", "The conspiracy language is an indication of how the STC views itself as a Saudi target, even though differences that turned it against the Yemeni government in August 2019 were supposed to have been resolved through the Riyadh Agreement. There are, in fact, grounds for suspicion. Riyadh has been silently working to dismantle the STC\u2019s strength on the ground \u2013 particularly around Aden \u2013 through a variety of measures, including buying the loyalty of military commanders affiliated with the STC, establishing new southern forces headed by commanders who are completely loyal to Saudi Arabia, and imposing their presence to control territory both inside Aden as well as in key areas outside the city, such as in Ras Alara in Lahj. Furthermore, depriving military forces affiliated with the STC from their source of income, could attract these fighters to groups where wages are regularly paid, altering the formula of power and influence in STC-controlled areas.", "A series of events over the past two months served to escalate tensions between the STC and Saudi Arabia. The STC was publicly humiliated in March when Saudi Arabia leaned on Jordan to prohibit STC officials from returning to Aden from Amman.", "Pressure piled up on the STC: Its soldiers were not receiving wages, key officials were prohibited from returning to Aden, frontline areas were not receiving support, some of its military commanders\u2019 loyalties were shifting, rival forces were encroaching on their territory, and now its own people were confronting it over public services. So it seems the STC tried to absorb all this by leaping into the unknown and dragging everyone with them.", "It wasn\u2019t necessarily a well thought-out plan. There are open questions about the fate of public institutions in areas under STC control, most importantly Aden port and the central bank, with the latter funding the import of all basic commodities and oil purchases using a Saudi deposit. This puts the STC in a difficult situation. How will it manage these challenges if the central bank shuts its doors?", "It\u2019s possible that the situation will deteriorate further and escalate into a military confrontation between the government and the STC. The biggest risk of violence is in Abyan, where frontlines separating the parties remain from the last round of fighting.", "The STC, in addition to the questionable loyalties of its partners in Abyan, has complex relations with many southern parties.", "The situation is also complicated for Saudi Arabia. Of immediate urgency is what to do with Saudi forces in Aden. Staying in the city amid the STC\u2019s insistence on self-rule implies either Saudi approval of what the STC is doing, impotence in the face of a challenge from what is supposed to be an obedient proxy or a risk of being drawn into an armed confrontation. With no guaranteed end result, Saudi Arabia is in an unenviable position. Its relationship with the STC has been fraught with difficulties for four months now. The recent STC statement will only make matters worse if taken as an insult by a Kingdom that has propagated a great deal of optimism around the Riyadh Agreement.

Internally, the governors of five key provinces representing much of the South\u2019s territory and resources \u2014 Hadramawt, Shabwa, al-Mahra, Socotra, and Abyan \u2014 rejected the declaration, refuting yet again the idea that the STC is the representative of southern grievances, as it regularly claims. The absence of public rallies in support of the STC\u2019s declaration in these governorates, except for an armed attempt to destabilize the island of Socotra (some 950 km away from Aden) that Saudi Arabia tried to contain, appears to back up the governors\u2019 stance for now. Regionally, the Saudi-led coalition and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) reiterated their support for the Yemeni government.", "Growing dissatisfaction", "The STC faces rising internal pressure for preventing the government from delivering services while itself failing to fill the gap.

The council\u2019s leaders \u2014 who are now in Abu Dhabi after Riyadh blocked their reentry to Aden from Amman on March 11 \u2014 expected outside developments would compel Saudi Arabia and the international community to turn a blind eye to, if not endorse, their announcement.", "Unsatisfied with its geographical limitation to Aden and parts of Dale and Lahj, the STC wants to expand its control of Abyan and Shabwa toward the eastern governorates and to become a dominant de facto actor, similarly to the Houthis in the North.", "Recalibrating ties with Saudi Arabia", "By declaring self-rule the STC also sought to advance its efforts to be part of comprehensive peace talks as an independent actor and recalibrate its strained ties with Saudi Arabia. Yet the Riyadh Agreement already grants the STC and other southern entities representation in the government, and by extension, involvement in peace talks through its implementation.", "Implications", "There are five primary local, regional, and international implications. First, the self-administration declaration has doubtless complicated conflict dynamics and resolution efforts more broadly. It has further deepened the state of instability as COVID-19 spreads across the country, as the STC\u2019s attempt to take over Socotra has made clear. Second, the establishment of shadow committees erodes the authority of the legitimate government on the ground, reduces its already limited sources of revenue, weakens its ability to deliver services and pay salaries, and runs the risk of getting the public accustomed to the full absence of state institutions.", "Third, the self-administration announcement will, contrary to what the STC would have hoped, likely increase international support for the territorial integrity and unity of Yemen in the short to medium term.", "Fourth, the STC is unlikely to be viewed as the sole representative of the southern cause at the international level, although perhaps as the most powerful one, unless major southern and eastern entities endorse it", "Finally, Riyadh will likely attempt to further curtail the STC\u2019s power in the short term, albeit cautiously, so as to avoid confrontation, while also slowly balancing against its regional sponsor, the UAE, to increase its influence in the South", "As the STC has not yet retracted its announcement, the least costly way to avert further escalation is to implement the security, military, and political provisions of the Riyadh Agreement \u2013 by Ibrahim Jalal", "https://www.mei.edu/publications/self-administration-will-it-strengthen-yemens-stc-or-further-complicate-conflict", "(** B P)", "What Happens After Hadi?", "The departure of Hadi from the presidency would be another major turning point in the Yemen War, with the fallout far from certain.

The potential repercussions go beyond the legal aspect related to the death of a president, which is governed by a constitutional mechanism that would see Vice President Ali Mohsen temporarily assume the presidential office. Yemen is in a state of war with complex local, regional and international dimensions; therefore, one cannot rest assured that everything will be fine just because there is a mechanism that will take its legal course. The ascension of Ali Mohsen to the presidency would likely face both international and domestic opposition.

The country\u2019s many conflicts are interconnected and can no longer be separated by clear divisions between external and internal actors and events. Throughout 2019, the Houthis and the Government of Yemen made little headway towards either a political settlement or a conclusive military victory. In a continuation from 2018, the belligerents continued to practice economic warfare: using economic obstruction and financial tools as weapons to starve opponents of funds or materials. Profiteering from the conflict is endemic.", "In the south, the Government of Yemen confronted the military challenges posed by the forces affiliated with the southern transitional council. The vice-president of the council, Hani Ali Salem Binbrek, initiated a conflict when he used force to remove what little authority the Government of Yemen held in Aden. Ongoing clashes on the Abyan and Shabwah borders and the limited progress in the implementation of the Riyadh Agreement indicate that the situation in the south remains volatile.", "In the north, the Houthis continued to consolidate their political and military control, in particular through their pervasive intelligence services, which include both the preventative security and a new security and intelligence bureau. Houthi forces also engaged in the brutal suppression of tribal opposition and political dissent. The Panel of Experts on Yemen has identified a Houthi network involved in the repression of women who oppose the Houthis, including through the use of sexual violence, headed by the director of the Sana\u2019a-based criminal investigation department, Sultan Zabin.", "Throughout most of 2019, the Houthi forces continued and intensified their aerial attacks on Saudi Arabia. In addition to the previously known weapon systems, they used a new type of Delta-design uncrewed aerial vehicle and a new model of land attack cruise missile. The Panel has investigated the high-profile attack on 14 September 2019 on the Saudi Aramco facilities in Abqaiq and Khurays and finds that, despite claims to the contrary, the Houthi forces are unlikely to be responsible for the attack, as the estimated range of the weapon systems used does not allow for a launch from Houthi-controlled territory. Nevertheless, a number of other attacks on Saudi Arabia can clearly be attributed to the Houthi forces.", "Following the attack in September, the Houthis made a public offer to establish a ceasefire. The ceasefire has been broadly complied with. Both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis now publicly state that they are engaged in discussions, while the launching of longer-range uncrewed aerial vehicles and missile strikes by Houthi forces against Saudi Arabia has abated.", "With regard to potential violations of the targeted arms embargo, the Panel observes two major trends: the first is the transfer of commercially available parts, such as uncrewed aerial vehicle engines, servo actuators and electronics, which are exported from industrialized countries through a network of intermediaries to the Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, where they are integrated into locally assembled uncrewed aerial vehicles and waterborne improvised explosive devices; the second is the continued reception by Houthi forces of military support in the form of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, anti-tank guided missiles and more sophisticated cruise missile systems. Some of those weapons have technical characteristics similar to arms manufactured in the Islamic Republic of Iran. For both commercial parts and weapons, the main smuggling route seems to run overland from Oman and the southern coast of Yemen, through territory controlled by the Government of Yemen, towards Sana\u2019a. The high-profile seizure on 25 November 2019 of a dhow carrying anti-tank guided missiles and other missile parts in the Arabian Sea indicates that, as in previous years, sea transport continues to play a role in potential violations of the targeted arms embargo.", "The absence of the rule of law and oversight in Yemen allows for the illicit enrichment of a small number of predatory entrepreneurs, some of whom hold official posts in public institutions. Within this context, and with the lack of any accountability, national wealth and external aid are increasingly either diverted or lost owing to corrupt practices by officials of the Government of Yemen and the Houthis. As tools of economic warfare, the parties have created obstacles to block the financing of the importation of goods and caused delays for the vessels carrying them to Yemen.", "The Panel found indications of illicit enrichment through the manipulation of foreign exchange rates by the Central Bank of Yemen in Aden. The Panel found that the Houthis were involved in cases of violations of asset freeze measures by allowing the diversion of frozen assets and public funds through false contracts for the benefit of individuals acting on behalf of Abdulmalik al-Houthi (YEi.004). Saleh Mesfer Alshaer, a Houthi general in charge of logistics, was also instrumental in the diversion of funds unlawfully appropriated from Houthi opponents.", "Violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law continued to be widely committed by all parties in Yemen with impunity. The air strikes conducted by the Coalition to Support Legitimacy in Yemen, led by Saudi Arabia, and the indiscriminate use of explosive ordnance, including landmines, by Houthi forces continue to disproportionately affect civilians and civilian infrastructures. Arbitrary arrest and detention, enforced disappearances, ill-treatment and the torture of detainees continue to be conducted by the Government of Yemen, Saudi Arabia, the Houthis and the forces affiliated with the United Arab Emirates. In Aden, the absence of the rule of law allows armed groups affiliated with the United Arab Emirates to conduct such violations and to operate outside the control of the Government of Yemen. Threats and acts of violence against humanitarians, as well as administrative hurdles to the delivery of assistance, are increasing in Houthi-controlled areas.", "https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/letter-dated-27-january-2020-panel-experts-yemen-addressed-president-security-council-0", "and letter in full: https://undocs.org/en/S/2020/326", "My comment: And now all sides of the conflict will start cherrypicking.", "(** B K P)", "After Another \u2018Coup\u2019 in Aden, Which Government in Yemen Is \u2018Legitimate\u2019?", "Meanwhile, the powerless deposed president can only sit and watch as he loses control to the Houthis and the STC. Indeed, he has spent most of the war far away and safely in Riyadh, only having made six visits to Yemen in five years. At times, his Saudi patrons have even put him under house arrest and have barred him from traveling to Yemen out of fear of his safety. Indeed, even a couple of weeks before the latest STC coup in Aden five scholars with an expert knowledge about Yemen contracted by the Sana\u2019a Center for Strategic Studies were unanimous in the fact that Hadi has negligible effective power. Still, in the press his government \u2013 even though it is hardly functioning \u2013 religiously remains quoted as \"legitimate\" and \"internationally recognized.\"", "The Houthis: \"rebels\" and \"Iranian proxies,\" but no government", "The Houthis, on the other hand, who have retained governance over large swaths of the most populous regions of the country for five years, in the press do not even get the courtesy of being described as in power of a government \u2013 let alone a \"legitimate\" one. They are strenuously called \"rebels\" fighting an insurgency against the sovereign government. True, since Hussein al-Houthi founded the movement in the early 2000s, that is indeed what they have done for years, first against the Saleh and then the Hadi regime. But when they overthrew Hadi and took over the capital, they also took over the government and have governed to the extent that this is possible given the circumstances of war and international isolation and blockade. In that capacity, they have ruled over 70-80% of Yemen\u2019s population for years. Even when Saleh terminated the fragile alliance, turned his forces against the Houthis and was killed by Houthi fighters in 2017, the group did not only manage to maintain its power, but tens of thousands of its supporters rallied the streets to celebrate Saleh\u2019s death.", "It should be noted that the Houthis took power in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and have ruled the country undemocratically ever since. But like so many dictators in the region, the West supported Saleh\u2019s autocratic rule for 33 years without protest, nor are any of the countries within the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis democratic. Most are hereditary monarchies who rule without any pretense of democracy, while some, like Egypt, are as much of a sham democracy as the Hadi regime itself. The war can thus not be justified as a Wilsonian crusade to bring democracy to the Middle East.", "Additionally, it can be argued that the Houthis have an appalling ruling record and are guilty of war crimes, too.", "But again, the same atrocities have been committed by Western allies.", "If not for humanitarian or democratic reasons, what then is the war really about? The answer can be found in the media\u2019s other common description of the Houthis, that of \"Iranian proxies.\" Indeed, underneath the pretext of reinstalling Hadi, rolling back Iran\u2019s alleged influence in Yemen is the real raison d\u2019\u00eatre on which the Saudi-led war on the people of Yemen is predicated. American and Gulf officials endlessly claim that their classified intelligence demonstrates that Iran has deployed elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) forces on the ground and are shipping weapons to the Houthis. Yet, they have never provided any shred of evidence so that these claims can be publicly falsified. Just as in the cases of WMDs in Iraq, Iran\u2019s nuclear bomb and Syria\u2019s gas attacks, the public is to belief these officials on their word.", "In fact, on a few occasions the most mainstream of publications have themselves debunked the unfounded notion that the Houthis are merely Iranian proxies with no real agenda or agency of their own. The Washington Post, Foreign Policy, Brookings Institute and Chatham house have all pointed out that Iranian support to the Houthis is marginal at best and have highlighted political grievances rooted in anti-imperialism at the origins of the movement instead.", "Western policy makers like to describe conflicts in the Middle East as exclusively sectarian-based in order to downplay the role of Western and Israeli interventionism in the region. Based on the teachings of Bernard Lewis and Samuel Huntington, neoconservative pundits claim that the \"clash of civilizations\" thesis proofs that Islam is an inherently violent religion and that unsurmountable Shi\u2019a-Sunni divisions lay at the foundations of conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere. They fail to explain, however, that the common denominator in all these conflicts is that Shi\u2019as and Sunnis largely coexisted peacefully up until foreign intervention brought conflict and stoked sectarian strife. Even then, very much like the mislabeled \"Religious Wars\" of early modern Europe, opportunistic and strategic cross-religious alliances are made all the time.", "That is not to say that religion does never play any part in Middle Eastern conflicts, but rather that it usually serves a secondary role of catalysator", "Recently, the Trump administration has started to backtrack on the claim that it is fighting Iran in Yemen. Brian Hook, the hawkish special representative for Iran, for instance, was in September of last year still claiming that Iran was \"controlling and deploying\" the Houthis as a \"terror front.\" In December, however, he admitted that \"Iran clearly does not speak for the Houthis.\" With that admission, any accuse in favor of this devastating war on the Yemeni people falls flat on its face.", "How to stop the suffering?", "With the war having all but decimated the health care system of what was already the Middle East\u2019s poorest country, many commentators have sounded the alarm about the damage the incipient coronavirus outbreak in the country could wreak. Yet, however alarming, Sana\u2019a-based journalist Nasser Arrabyee reminds us that the main threat to the Yemeni people remains the Saudi-led destruction visited upon the country by the blockade, fighting and bombing. This, more than anything else, prevents Yemenis from arming themselves against the virus", "Both the Hadi and Houthi regimes claim to be Yemen\u2019s legitimate government. After five years of war, neither have succeeded in taking over the whole country and imposing sovereignty. But only the Houthis have managed to retain their dominance over a vast majority of the population, possibly because of their perceived record of anti-corruption and battling foreign meddling. Meanwhile, failure to pay salaries to Gulf-backed mercenaries was cited as one of the core reasons for the STC\u2019s latest coup in Aden, demonstrating that lavish Gulf funds have artificially inflated the demand for resistance against the Houthis. Thus, neither the STC nor the Hadi regime enjoy unambivalent consent of the governed in the sparsely populated south, where al-Qaeda and ISIS militants keep filling the power vacuum. Conversely, the Houthis never came close to losing their control of Sana\u2019a even without major funds and under pains of international isolation. In short, only the Houthis have been able to maintain a monopoly of violence over large swaths of the population for a considerable time. Therefore, though the desirability of their rule can be debated, only they can be said to be in control of a functioning state in the most basic, Weberian sense of the word.", "Recognizing this fact is the first step in ending one of the greatest humanitarian disasters of the 21st century. As the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s most powerful allies, the Western powers hold the key to end the war.", "As this article has made clear, the truth is the reverse. Strong Western condemnations of the inhumane blockade, the halting of arms sales to Gulf countries, a general departure from the Western-Gulf alliance and opening diplomatic relations with the Houthi regime are some of the steps that could embolden the strained negotiations and speed up the pressure on the Saudi-led coalition to admit defeat and come to terms with a settlement.

They have shown reckless disregard toward journalists again and again, including when they held Abdullah Kabil and Yousef Alaizry captive in 2015 in a building that had been repeatedly bombed only for them to be buried in its rubble on its next hit. Furthermore, since the war began, the Houthis have exchanged prisoners with Al-Qaeda, released hundreds of enemy forces\u2019 fighters and, most recently, offered an exchange for five Saudi soldiers including a pilot shot down over Al-Jawf in February, but have rejected every call for the release of the journalists now on death row, rebuffing foreign and domestic mediation attempts.

A major point of contention dealt with the future makeup of Yemen. Southerners aligned with the Hadi government backed plans to transform Yemen into a six-region federation, which was proposed in February 2014 and rejected at the time by most Southern Movement factions. Meanwhile, the STC was adamant about the secession of southern Yemen. A second factor in the tensions is historical and linked to the intense rivalry between two political-social groups.", "The STC benefitted in 2017 from the momentum of the southern cause, and used that to solidify itself politically, expand its geographic influence, build its internal structure to function both as a party and to mimic a state, and increase its military capacity. However, at this point, it remained a de facto power and did not attempt to leverage its strength into becoming a ruling authority like the Houthi movement did in northern Yemen.", "In January 2018, clashes broke out between the government and STC-aligned forces in Aden, but there were several reasons the \u201csouthern-southern\u201d division stopped short of reaching the point of no return.", "On the surface, it seemed that the situation exploded after the Houthi assassination of Abu al-Yamama, commander of the Security Belt forces in Aden and an iconic Southern Movement and resistance leader. The missile attack that killed him, and recriminations by STC figures that Islah had collaborated with the Houthis, sparked a chain of events that quickly had Hadi government soldiers and STC-allied forces turning on each other, with the former eventually ejected from the city. On a deeper level, however, the UAE\u2019s decision earlier in the year to begin withdrawing troops from Yemen was the main impetus behind the escalation of events. The STC\u2019s rivals and their respective regional backers \u2014 the Houthis and Iran, Hadi and Saudi Arabia, Islah and Qatar and Turkey \u2014 wanted to preempt a power vacuum in southern Yemen and put an end to Abu Dhabi\u2019s policy of empowering its local allies, which had dramatically bolstered the STC\u2019s military capabilities over the years. Meanwhile, the STC leadership pressed hard in response to the targeting of its commanders, attempting to grab territory before the fragile strategic balance in the south was disturbed.", "In the end, the Houthis succeeded in pitting their rivals against one another.", "Synchronizing political and security measures would represent the magical solution needed for the Riyadh Agreement to succeed, but Riyadh has struggled to activate the political components of the agreement and has instead focused its efforts on security arrangements \u2014 an approach the STC views as directly targeting it and empowering its rivals.", "The radical change in the balance of power in southern Yemen in favor of Riyadh and its allies deprived the STC of the space to maneuver that it had when the UAE was present there, and it undermined its political ability to curb the Hadi government\u2019s obstructive behavior. Instead of accepting self-erosion, it made the dramatic announcement of self-rule across southern Yemen. The STC\u2019s call was not welcomed in most southern governorates, but it succeeded in shaking up the political stalemate surrounding the Riyadh Agreement.", "Saudi Arabia has a real interest in seeing the Riyadh Agreement is implemented, and this is why the agreement is still standing despite the STC\u2019s escalation and the Hadi government\u2019s obstruction. The agreed upon power-sharing framework may help avoid a repeat of the full-blown descent into open violence witnessed in August of last year.

The content of the STC\u2019s self-rule statement appears to be mostly directed against Saudi Arabia, and reflects the deteriorating relations between the group and Riyadh. The text, which spoke about conspiracies, noted that wages had not been paid to the council\u2019s military and security forces; frontline areas had not been supplied with weapons, ammunition and food; and support for the wounded and families of martyrs had stopped. Following the UAE pullout from Yemen and the signing of the Riyadh Agreement, the Saudis assumed complete control, meaning these responsibilities fell under their purview.", "The conspiracy language is an indication of how the STC views itself as a Saudi target, even though differences that turned it against the Yemeni government in August 2019 were supposed to have been resolved through the Riyadh Agreement. There are, in fact, grounds for suspicion. Riyadh has been silently working to dismantle the STC\u2019s strength on the ground \u2013 particularly around Aden \u2013 through a variety of measures, including buying the loyalty of military commanders affiliated with the STC, establishing new southern forces headed by commanders who are completely loyal to Saudi Arabia, and imposing their presence to control territory both inside Aden as well as in key areas outside the city, such as in Ras Alara in Lahj. Furthermore, depriving military forces affiliated with the STC from their source of income, could attract these fighters to groups where wages are regularly paid, altering the formula of power and influence in STC-controlled areas.", "A series of events over the past two months served to escalate tensions between the STC and Saudi Arabia. The STC was publicly humiliated in March when Saudi Arabia leaned on Jordan to prohibit STC officials from returning to Aden from Amman.", "Pressure piled up on the STC: Its soldiers were not receiving wages, key officials were prohibited from returning to Aden, frontline areas were not receiving support, some of its military commanders\u2019 loyalties were shifting, rival forces were encroaching on their territory, and now its own people were confronting it over public services. So it seems the STC tried to absorb all this by leaping into the unknown and dragging everyone with them.", "It wasn\u2019t necessarily a well thought-out plan. There are open questions about the fate of public institutions in areas under STC control, most importantly Aden port and the central bank, with the latter funding the import of all basic commodities and oil purchases using a Saudi deposit. This puts the STC in a difficult situation. How will it manage these challenges if the central bank shuts its doors?", "It\u2019s possible that the situation will deteriorate further and escalate into a military confrontation between the government and the STC. The biggest risk of violence is in Abyan, where frontlines separating the parties remain from the last round of fighting.", "The STC, in addition to the questionable loyalties of its partners in Abyan, has complex relations with many southern parties.", "The situation is also complicated for Saudi Arabia. Of immediate urgency is what to do with Saudi forces in Aden. Staying in the city amid the STC\u2019s insistence on self-rule implies either Saudi approval of what the STC is doing, impotence in the face of a challenge from what is supposed to be an obedient proxy or a risk of being drawn into an armed confrontation. With no guaranteed end result, Saudi Arabia is in an unenviable position. Its relationship with the STC has been fraught with difficulties for four months now. The recent STC statement will only make matters worse if taken as an insult by a Kingdom that has propagated a great deal of optimism around the Riyadh Agreement.

Internally, the governors of five key provinces representing much of the South\u2019s territory and resources \u2014 Hadramawt, Shabwa, al-Mahra, Socotra, and Abyan \u2014 rejected the declaration, refuting yet again the idea that the STC is the representative of southern grievances, as it regularly claims. The absence of public rallies in support of the STC\u2019s declaration in these governorates, except for an armed attempt to destabilize the island of Socotra (some 950 km away from Aden) that Saudi Arabia tried to contain, appears to back up the governors\u2019 stance for now. Regionally, the Saudi-led coalition and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) reiterated their support for the Yemeni government.", "Growing dissatisfaction", "The STC faces rising internal pressure for preventing the government from delivering services while itself failing to fill the gap.

The council\u2019s leaders \u2014 who are now in Abu Dhabi after Riyadh blocked their reentry to Aden from Amman on March 11 \u2014 expected outside developments would compel Saudi Arabia and the international community to turn a blind eye to, if not endorse, their announcement.", "Unsatisfied with its geographical limitation to Aden and parts of Dale and Lahj, the STC wants to expand its control of Abyan and Shabwa toward the eastern governorates and to become a dominant de facto actor, similarly to the Houthis in the North.", "Recalibrating ties with Saudi Arabia", "By declaring self-rule the STC also sought to advance its efforts to be part of comprehensive peace talks as an independent actor and recalibrate its strained ties with Saudi Arabia. Yet the Riyadh Agreement already grants the STC and other southern entities representation in the government, and by extension, involvement in peace talks through its implementation.", "Implications", "There are five primary local, regional, and international implications. First, the self-administration declaration has doubtless complicated conflict dynamics and resolution efforts more broadly. It has further deepened the state of instability as COVID-19 spreads across the country, as the STC\u2019s attempt to take over Socotra has made clear. Second, the establishment of shadow committees erodes the authority of the legitimate government on the ground, reduces its already limited sources of revenue, weakens its ability to deliver services and pay salaries, and runs the risk of getting the public accustomed to the full absence of state institutions.", "Third, the self-administration announcement will, contrary to what the STC would have hoped, likely increase international support for the territorial integrity and unity of Yemen in the short to medium term.", "Fourth, the STC is unlikely to be viewed as the sole representative of the southern cause at the international level, although perhaps as the most powerful one, unless major southern and eastern entities endorse it", "Finally, Riyadh will likely attempt to further curtail the STC\u2019s power in the short term, albeit cautiously, so as to avoid confrontation, while also slowly balancing against its regional sponsor, the UAE, to increase its influence in the South", "As the STC has not yet retracted its announcement, the least costly way to avert further escalation is to implement the security, military, and political provisions of the Riyadh Agreement \u2013 by Ibrahim Jalal", "https://www.mei.edu/publications/self-administration-will-it-strengthen-yemens-stc-or-further-complicate-conflict", "(** B P)", "What Happens After Hadi?", "The departure of Hadi from the presidency would be another major turning point in the Yemen War, with the fallout far from certain.

The potential repercussions go beyond the legal aspect related to the death of a president, which is governed by a constitutional mechanism that would see Vice President Ali Mohsen temporarily assume the presidential office. Yemen is in a state of war with complex local, regional and international dimensions; therefore, one cannot rest assured that everything will be fine just because there is a mechanism that will take its legal course. The ascension of Ali Mohsen to the presidency would likely face both international and domestic opposition.
