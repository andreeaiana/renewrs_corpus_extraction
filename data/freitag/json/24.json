The result of this multipolar war of attrition is that upwards of 18 million Yemenis face starvation and disease.", "Under the cover of a media silence that disregards the warnings of health providers, more than 63,000 children living in the besieged northwest of the country died in 2016 alone (the last year UNICEF dared to count). With no visits from Hollywood movie stars to touch the charitable hearts of the First World public, few know that, since the beginning of 2017, over a million have been infected by cholera. More up-to-date approximations are even more horrific.2", "How will historians a generation or two from now write about this war on Yemen? Will there be any interest in inspecting more deeply what happened, why, and under whose watch such a crime was committed? Or will future historians resort to repeating the dominant frames used to characterize (or ignore) this war on Yemen used today?", "No doubt those considering a deeper look will first consult the media\u2019s archives. What they will be surprised to see, perhaps, is how much this disaster in Yemen has been kept out of the daily news. By all accounts, those committing hundreds of billions of dollars to a war on Yemenis would prefer that little to no attention be spent on its atrocities. Corporate media have been happy to oblige.3", "Trying to answer why the images of emaciated children and the upwards of 18 million civilians threatened by starvation are not making headlines across the world could itself become the heart of any future study on Yemen\u2019s war. Such a task will require, however, moving beyond the security-centered, international relations\u2019 frames of analysis prevalent in the available scholarly literature today. Present-day scholars and experts whose salaries are paid by the very regimes imposing this war may prove unhelpful in explaining the journalistic omerta future historians will wish to study.4", "The conventional narrative about the war unleashed by \u2018coalition\u2019 forces positions the US-led \u2018global community\u2019 as a benevolent agent simply aiming to reinstate the \u2018legitimate\u2019 presidency of one Abd-Rabbu Mansur Hadi for the sake of regional stability. Rarely highlighted any longer, this politically meek former vice president was the anointed partner to interests that, in reaction to uprisings in 2010\u20132011 against globalization, sought to suppress what is known as \u2018the Arab Spring\u2019 by imposing a reliable \u2018interim government.\u20195 Appointed in 2012 as an alternative to the no longer useful Ali Abdullah Saleh (president since 1978) and a barrier to \u2018radical\u2019 populist groups pushing for the reversal of austerity policies, the Obama and May administrations gave Hadi the task of continuing Yemen\u2019s highly unpopular integration into the global economy that had been interrupted by those 2010\u20132011 \u2018change\u2019 uprisings.", "Mischaracterized as \u2018support\u2019 for America\u2019s imposed counter-revolutionary solution, most of those protesting in 2011 were willing to give the US-directed process a chance considering they faced treats of perpetual violence from various factions vulnerable to populist demands for radical change. The trouble proved to be that Hadi\u2019s actual mandate was to push even more aggressively the very \u2018structural adjustments\u2019 against which Yemen\u2019s people protested in the first place. The violence and economic destitution this interim 2012\u20132014 period produced is all but forgotten in 2019. Such amnesia is critical as it makes it possible today for think tank employees to insinuate that there was no justification for Hadi\u2019s removal from the seat of the Yemeni government after his interim two-year period ended in mid-2014.", "While future readers of the extant analysis of Yemen will note that Hadi\u2019s arrest in late 2014 constitutes a \u2018coup\u2019 by \u2018Iranian-backed Houthi rebels,\u2019 rarely does the background to these events extend to acknowledging the justifications for the nation\u2019s collective outrage expressed against the IMF-austerity Hadi imposed. Indeed, if relying exclusively on the published material today, future historians will be strained to learn that Hadi\u2019s ready cooperation in the 2012\u20132014 period extended to implementing unpopular IMF and World Bank austerity programmes, tearing up previous leases benefiting UAE-based companies and granting new ones to Saudi and Qatari companies instead. In availing Yemen\u2019s primary assets to reliable American business partners, Yemen proved equally safe from China, which had secured with the previous Saleh government access to the country\u2019s agriculture, oil/gas and fisheries assets. Worse still for many who had originally formed in 2010\u20132011 a cross-sectional alliance to reverse Yemen\u2019s economic liquidation, Hadi and his American/Saudi/Qatar benefactors gave free reign to armed groups linked to Muslim Brotherhood affiliates known as Islah. Partnering with trusted members of the US-trained special units in the Yemeni army, foreign fighters and local loyalists actively chased down and murdered Yemeni leaders hostile to the globalist project they and Hadi\u2019s government were charged to impose.6", "In this respect, large numbers of Yemenis, be they in the North or South, recognized the US-backed Hadi project as a reactionary, neo-colonialist disaster that needed addressing. To those behind his arrest, a larger coalition of actors from across the political, socioeconomic and regional spectrum who were willing to take up arms to steer Yemen back toward real reform, the objectives of the interim government were clearly servicing outsiders\u2019 interests. Selling off Yemen\u2019s future to benefit the US Embassy were grounds for termination on perfectly logical patriotic, moral, and/or legal lines. The problem is few of the vetted analyses produced today acknowledge that armed intervention by self-declared defenders of the 2011 \u2018change\u2019 revolution as either justified or patriotic. This proves debilitating in today\u2019s scholarship and threatens to distort future historical inspections: millions of people, after all, have declared support for a revolution (September 21, 2014) that remains as vigilant in 2019, despite five years of war.", "Yemen (re)presented", "Future historians will discover that it is rare to come across any analysis acknowledging, let alone explaining, the huge popular support for the armed rebellion led to halt Hadi\u2019s ruinous economic \u2018reforms.\u2019 Never mentioned as such, the biased catch all references to \u2018the Houthi militias\u2019 as the ones behind \u2018the coup\u2019 actively erases the possibility that there are deeper and broader sources of legitimacy for those resisting what has since March 2015 become a US-facilitated war on Yemen. Indeed, future historians may be hard pressed to understand at all what motivates those engaged in this now almost five-year war if left with this crude binary of \u2018Houthi militias\u2019 vs. the \u2018legitimate government of Hadi.\u2019 Revealing, this misleading characterization is not for a lack of material.7", "While the scholarship today largely ignores local Yemeni justifications for resistance, a brief investment in studying the statements made by various activists forming the alliances around the \u2018national salvation government\u2019 based in Sana\u2018a\u2019 throughout the war would reveal some intriguing characteristics \u2013 by Isa Blumi", "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23801883.2019.1699332", "(** B P)", "YEMEN: THE HOUTHI SUPERVISORY SYSTEM", "The complex interplay of formal and informal political, military, and security structures in Yemen poses a challenge for humanitarian agencies trying to operate on the ground while adhering to humanitarian principles in Houthi-controlled territories. This situation is made even more complex by the increasing competition between different wings of the Houthi movement, and between local elites and the central regime, for the control of state institutions. Understanding political environments is key to ensuring an effective provision of humanitarian assistance. In Yemen, particularly, a thorough understanding of local elite networks is needed in order for humanitarians to engage with state actors in a way that is neutral, impartial, and independent.This report explores the history of the Houthi movement and the structure of the Houthi regime highlighting the need for nuanced and customised approaches to state authorities in different parts of Houthi-controlled Yemen.", "In Houthi-controlled territories, formal state authorities are systematically paralleled by the Houthi supervisory system. This \u2018shadow state\u2019 guarantees the control of the central regime over its peripheries, and the grip of the Houthi inner-circle over local elites of Houthi supporters (the mutahawwithin). As a result, decision-making does not necessarily lie with those actors who are formally representing the state (e.g. governors, ministers, security directors, etc.). Rather, it often lies with informal Houthi supervisors. Choosing one political interlocutor over another can make the difference and requires a thorough understanding of elite dynamics.", "Key Findings", "The supervisory system operates as a direct link between the inner circle of the Houthi leadership and the local governance system. Most Houthi general supervisors are Hashemites from the northern governorates, ideologically committed, and tied to the leadership by kinship and territory.", "Since December 2017, a gradual merging of formal institutions and the informal supervisory system is underway, with Houthi supervisors and loyalists appointed in state authorities. New state authorities, established outside of the law and placed under Houthi control, are making formal institutions redundant and ineffective.", "Houthi supervisors from the northern governorates and local elites of Houthi sympathisers (mutahawwithin) often compete for influence and the control of governorates\u2019 institutions.", "The regime's architecture is ever-evolving and volatile. State institutions and the supervisory system are increasingly merging, with the result that prominent Houthi leaders are now holding formal state positions.", "The relationship between the Houthi inner-circle and local elites shapes different configurations of power in each governorate. Charting these dynamics on the governorate level is fundamental for humanitarian agencies to successfully deal with local authorities.", "https://www.acaps.org/sites/acaps/files/products/files/20200617_acaps_yemen_analysis_hub_the_houthi_supervisory_system.pdf", "If the link does not work, try https://www.acaps.org/country/yemen/special-reports#container-1501", "(** B K P)", "The War Comes Home", "The Yemen conflict has affected Saudi border areas and is changing the public\u2019s thinking in the kingdom.", "Since Riyadh intervened militarily in Yemen in 2015, Saudis have actively discussed developments there on social media, reflecting growing public interest in Yemeni affairs. This has been accompanied by ongoing, wide-ranging debates between Yemenis and Saudis over the details and trajectory of the war and how the Saudi intervention is seen by Saudi society. Most Saudi activists have adopted a similar discourse to that of the Saudi state, partly due to government censorship and intense monitoring of social media platforms, precluding any opposing voices. However, the level of debate shows how much attention Saudis have paid in recent years to news from Yemen, which has had a direct impact on their lives.", "The economic costs of Saudi involvement in the conflict alone have had major effects on Saudi society, in the form of tax hikes, raised fees for various services, and higher fuel prices. The conflict has also sparked a string of Houthi missile attacks against targets inside Saudi territory, sowing fear among ordinary Saudis and prompting many to start following the news from Yemen more closely.", "Totally forbidden from criticizing their government or critiquing its policies, Saudis writing on the war have focused on the country\u2019s enemy and limited their criticism of Saudi-backed actors in Yemen to questioning their seriousness and ability to achieve victory. The situation in Yemen has brought to prominence new Saudi writers, who have treated the subject as a safe topic for political commentary\u2014provided that they adopt the official narrative.", "Prior to the war, Yemen received hardly any attention in Saudi life.", "The kingdom\u2019s weak spot in this regard is its territory along the Yemen border, where the war has changed security arrangements and demography. When the war broke out in 2015, the Saudi government moved many residents of villages near the border to cities deeper inside Saudi Arabia, essentially turning the region into a buffer zone. This zone extends into Yemeni territory along the border, to a depth of between 10 and 40 kilometers toward Houthi-controlled territory. The goal of this was to prevent incursions into Saudi Arabia, especially as land clashes with the Houthis have dragged on.", "This shift in Saudi strategy in its southern region has had major repercussions for tribes along the frontier. Before it engaged the Houthis in military conflict, Saudi Arabia relied heavily on these tribes, both inside Saudi and Yemeni territory, to secure the long border.", "Throughout the current conflict Riyadh has relied on Yemeni conscripts\u2014by some estimates numbering as many as 60,000 fighters\u2014distributed across various fronts along the border. However, these fighters only make up the first line. Behind them are a multitude of military and security forces charged by the kingdom with securing its territories. Saudi Arabia has lost dozens of troops in the area due to clashes and artillery fire emanating from Houthi-held areas.", "As many as half the Saudi troops lost in these clashes hail from the southwestern border region, especially Jizan, upon whom Riyadh has relied heavily. These casualties have naturally had a social impact. Despite Saudi glorification of soldiers sacrificing their lives to guard the frontier, the losses have been deeply felt nationwide, especially in contrast to the stability that had reigned in previous decades.", "Fighting in certain border regions has also forced the closure of markets once vital to local economies. The closure of major border crossings in the Tuwal district has caused major economic losses for Saudis living in surrounding areas. The war has shown that residents of Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern cities and villages have not been shielded from the repercussions of Riyadh\u2019s intervention. The conflict has brought changes to the way that Saudis think, which will remain strongly present in the coming years. Even after the war ends, Saudi Arabia will face many domestic problems born of the long conflict in Yemen \u2013 by Ahmed Nagi", "https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/82092", "(** B K P)", "After Libya, will Turkey defeat the UAE in Yemen?", "Most of the attention that Turkey\u2019s military interventions are attracting tend to be focussed on Libya, Syria and the occasional air strike in the Iraqi Kurdistan region against terrorist PKK targets. What has gone largely unnoticed is Turkey\u2019s growing involvement in Yemen, although it is still debatable what it entails and whether it is in its national interests and can yield strategic results in the long term.", "According to Turkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry website, the country has \u201cdeeply rooted historical and cultural ties with Yemen\u201d, which was once a province of the Ottoman Caliphate.", "In the five-year war in Yemen, Ankara has supported the UN-recognised government in exile in Saudi Arabia. Almost from the outset of the conflict, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed support for the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s intervention.", "Turkey\u2019s TRT World has previously discussed the country\u2019s influence in Yemen and acknowledged Ankara\u2019s geostrategic interests in the Red Sea and Bab Al-Mandeb Strait, as well as Turkey\u2019s potential to be a key player in Yemen\u2019s future.", "The Emirati-financed Arab Weekly, meanwhile, has been particularly vicious over the past three months, with articles accusing Turkey of building up its presence in Yemen, specifically in support of the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Al-Islah Party. The allegations against Ankara include Egypt\u2019s growing concerns such as Turkish \u201cinterference\u201d under the guise of humanitarian aid operating in three southern coastal regions and a joint \u201cQatar-Turkish plot\u201d to establish a militia recruitment camp in the Shabwa province.", "It is quite possible that these allegations contain half-truths or exaggerations and, according to Assistant Professor at Kings College London Dr Andreas Krieg, are a smokescreen to divert attention from the rise of the UAE-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) and the eventual fall of the Yemeni government-in-exile under President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.", "In the paradoxical world of Middle East alliances, Saudi Arabia is hostile to the Brotherhood and, along with the UAE, financed the military coup which overthrew Egypt\u2019s first civilian President Mohamed Morsi who was affiliated to the movement, and yet actively supports Al-Islah militia which function as Hadi\u2019s main fighting force on the ground against the Houthi-aligned Yemeni army.", "Turkey may well extend limited assistance to Al-Islah, but it is unlikely that the party will jeopardise its support from the Saudis. After five years of a costly war, though, the Saudis may find themselves unable to continue funding its mercenaries in Yemen who have thus far failed to undermine Houthi-domination of the north and the capital Sanaa. Interestingly, some Islah supporters have recently taken to using an online hashtag campaign asking Turkey to intervene in Yemen. Earlier this year the Yemeni government had to deny allegations that it had signed an agreement with Turkey to manage its ports and transport infrastructure.", "Nevertheless, the Saudis appear to take Turkey\u2019s involvement seriously. Reports last week said that the coalition prevented a Turkish cargo plane carrying aid from landing in the southern port city of Aden. Even so, in light of the ongoing conflict between Saudi-backed Al-Islah and UAE-supported STC forces in the south, if fears of Turkey\u2019s growing involvement are credible then it would be an ominous development for the UAE and its allied militias.", "The UAE has long been accused of attempting to annex the Yemeni island of Socotra to secure what it perceives to be its geopolitical interests in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. It already has military and naval bases in Djibouti, Eritrea and Somaliland.", "Turkey, of course, has its largest overseas military base located in the Somali capital Mogadishu as well as its largest embassy.

What they will be surprised to see, perhaps, is how much this disaster in Yemen has been kept out of the daily news. By all accounts, those committing hundreds of billions of dollars to a war on Yemenis would prefer that little to no attention be spent on its atrocities. Corporate media have been happy to oblige.3", "Trying to answer why the images of emaciated children and the upwards of 18 million civilians threatened by starvation are not making headlines across the world could itself become the heart of any future study on Yemen\u2019s war. Such a task will require, however, moving beyond the security-centered, international relations\u2019 frames of analysis prevalent in the available scholarly literature today. Present-day scholars and experts whose salaries are paid by the very regimes imposing this war may prove unhelpful in explaining the journalistic omerta future historians will wish to study.4", "The conventional narrative about the war unleashed by \u2018coalition\u2019 forces positions the US-led \u2018global community\u2019 as a benevolent agent simply aiming to reinstate the \u2018legitimate\u2019 presidency of one Abd-Rabbu Mansur Hadi for the sake of regional stability. Rarely highlighted any longer, this politically meek former vice president was the anointed partner to interests that, in reaction to uprisings in 2010\u20132011 against globalization, sought to suppress what is known as \u2018the Arab Spring\u2019 by imposing a reliable \u2018interim government.\u20195 Appointed in 2012 as an alternative to the no longer useful Ali Abdullah Saleh (president since 1978) and a barrier to \u2018radical\u2019 populist groups pushing for the reversal of austerity policies, the Obama and May administrations gave Hadi the task of continuing Yemen\u2019s highly unpopular integration into the global economy that had been interrupted by those 2010\u20132011 \u2018change\u2019 uprisings.", "Mischaracterized as \u2018support\u2019 for America\u2019s imposed counter-revolutionary solution, most of those protesting in 2011 were willing to give the US-directed process a chance considering they faced treats of perpetual violence from various factions vulnerable to populist demands for radical change. The trouble proved to be that Hadi\u2019s actual mandate was to push even more aggressively the very \u2018structural adjustments\u2019 against which Yemen\u2019s people protested in the first place. The violence and economic destitution this interim 2012\u20132014 period produced is all but forgotten in 2019. Such amnesia is critical as it makes it possible today for think tank employees to insinuate that there was no justification for Hadi\u2019s removal from the seat of the Yemeni government after his interim two-year period ended in mid-2014.", "While future readers of the extant analysis of Yemen will note that Hadi\u2019s arrest in late 2014 constitutes a \u2018coup\u2019 by \u2018Iranian-backed Houthi rebels,\u2019 rarely does the background to these events extend to acknowledging the justifications for the nation\u2019s collective outrage expressed against the IMF-austerity Hadi imposed. Indeed, if relying exclusively on the published material today, future historians will be strained to learn that Hadi\u2019s ready cooperation in the 2012\u20132014 period extended to implementing unpopular IMF and World Bank austerity programmes, tearing up previous leases benefiting UAE-based companies and granting new ones to Saudi and Qatari companies instead. In availing Yemen\u2019s primary assets to reliable American business partners, Yemen proved equally safe from China, which had secured with the previous Saleh government access to the country\u2019s agriculture, oil/gas and fisheries assets. Worse still for many who had originally formed in 2010\u20132011 a cross-sectional alliance to reverse Yemen\u2019s economic liquidation, Hadi and his American/Saudi/Qatar benefactors gave free reign to armed groups linked to Muslim Brotherhood affiliates known as Islah. Partnering with trusted members of the US-trained special units in the Yemeni army, foreign fighters and local loyalists actively chased down and murdered Yemeni leaders hostile to the globalist project they and Hadi\u2019s government were charged to impose.6", "In this respect, large numbers of Yemenis, be they in the North or South, recognized the US-backed Hadi project as a reactionary, neo-colonialist disaster that needed addressing. To those behind his arrest, a larger coalition of actors from across the political, socioeconomic and regional spectrum who were willing to take up arms to steer Yemen back toward real reform, the objectives of the interim government were clearly servicing outsiders\u2019 interests. Selling off Yemen\u2019s future to benefit the US Embassy were grounds for termination on perfectly logical patriotic, moral, and/or legal lines. The problem is few of the vetted analyses produced today acknowledge that armed intervention by self-declared defenders of the 2011 \u2018change\u2019 revolution as either justified or patriotic. This proves debilitating in today\u2019s scholarship and threatens to distort future historical inspections: millions of people, after all, have declared support for a revolution (September 21, 2014) that remains as vigilant in 2019, despite five years of war.", "Yemen (re)presented", "Future historians will discover that it is rare to come across any analysis acknowledging, let alone explaining, the huge popular support for the armed rebellion led to halt Hadi\u2019s ruinous economic \u2018reforms.\u2019 Never mentioned as such, the biased catch all references to \u2018the Houthi militias\u2019 as the ones behind \u2018the coup\u2019 actively erases the possibility that there are deeper and broader sources of legitimacy for those resisting what has since March 2015 become a US-facilitated war on Yemen. Indeed, future historians may be hard pressed to understand at all what motivates those engaged in this now almost five-year war if left with this crude binary of \u2018Houthi militias\u2019 vs. the \u2018legitimate government of Hadi.\u2019 Revealing, this misleading characterization is not for a lack of material.7", "While the scholarship today largely ignores local Yemeni justifications for resistance, a brief investment in studying the statements made by various activists forming the alliances around the \u2018national salvation government\u2019 based in Sana\u2018a\u2019 throughout the war would reveal some intriguing characteristics \u2013 by Isa Blumi", "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23801883.2019.1699332", "(** B P)", "YEMEN: THE HOUTHI SUPERVISORY SYSTEM", "The complex interplay of formal and informal political, military, and security structures in Yemen poses a challenge for humanitarian agencies trying to operate on the ground while adhering to humanitarian principles in Houthi-controlled territories. This situation is made even more complex by the increasing competition between different wings of the Houthi movement, and between local elites and the central regime, for the control of state institutions. Understanding political environments is key to ensuring an effective provision of humanitarian assistance. In Yemen, particularly, a thorough understanding of local elite networks is needed in order for humanitarians to engage with state actors in a way that is neutral, impartial, and independent.This report explores the history of the Houthi movement and the structure of the Houthi regime highlighting the need for nuanced and customised approaches to state authorities in different parts of Houthi-controlled Yemen.", "In Houthi-controlled territories, formal state authorities are systematically paralleled by the Houthi supervisory system. This \u2018shadow state\u2019 guarantees the control of the central regime over its peripheries, and the grip of the Houthi inner-circle over local elites of Houthi supporters (the mutahawwithin). As a result, decision-making does not necessarily lie with those actors who are formally representing the state (e.g. governors, ministers, security directors, etc.). Rather, it often lies with informal Houthi supervisors. Choosing one political interlocutor over another can make the difference and requires a thorough understanding of elite dynamics.", "Key Findings", "The supervisory system operates as a direct link between the inner circle of the Houthi leadership and the local governance system.

New state authorities, established outside of the law and placed under Houthi control, are making formal institutions redundant and ineffective.", "Houthi supervisors from the northern governorates and local elites of Houthi sympathisers (mutahawwithin) often compete for influence and the control of governorates\u2019 institutions.", "The regime's architecture is ever-evolving and volatile.

This has been accompanied by ongoing, wide-ranging debates between Yemenis and Saudis over the details and trajectory of the war and how the Saudi intervention is seen by Saudi society. Most Saudi activists have adopted a similar discourse to that of the Saudi state, partly due to government censorship and intense monitoring of social media platforms, precluding any opposing voices. However, the level of debate shows how much attention Saudis have paid in recent years to news from Yemen, which has had a direct impact on their lives.", "The economic costs of Saudi involvement in the conflict alone have had major effects on Saudi society, in the form of tax hikes, raised fees for various services, and higher fuel prices. The conflict has also sparked a string of Houthi missile attacks against targets inside Saudi territory, sowing fear among ordinary Saudis and prompting many to start following the news from Yemen more closely.", "Totally forbidden from criticizing their government or critiquing its policies, Saudis writing on the war have focused on the country\u2019s enemy and limited their criticism of Saudi-backed actors in Yemen to questioning their seriousness and ability to achieve victory.

When the war broke out in 2015, the Saudi government moved many residents of villages near the border to cities deeper inside Saudi Arabia, essentially turning the region into a buffer zone. This zone extends into Yemeni territory along the border, to a depth of between 10 and 40 kilometers toward Houthi-controlled territory. The goal of this was to prevent incursions into Saudi Arabia, especially as land clashes with the Houthis have dragged on.", "This shift in Saudi strategy in its southern region has had major repercussions for tribes along the frontier. Before it engaged the Houthis in military conflict, Saudi Arabia relied heavily on these tribes, both inside Saudi and Yemeni territory, to secure the long border.", "Throughout the current conflict Riyadh has relied on Yemeni conscripts\u2014by some estimates numbering as many as 60,000 fighters\u2014distributed across various fronts along the border. However, these fighters only make up the first line. Behind them are a multitude of military and security forces charged by the kingdom with securing its territories. Saudi Arabia has lost dozens of troops in the area due to clashes and artillery fire emanating from Houthi-held areas.", "As many as half the Saudi troops lost in these clashes hail from the southwestern border region, especially Jizan, upon whom Riyadh has relied heavily. These casualties have naturally had a social impact. Despite Saudi glorification of soldiers sacrificing their lives to guard the frontier, the losses have been deeply felt nationwide, especially in contrast to the stability that had reigned in previous decades.", "Fighting in certain border regions has also forced the closure of markets once vital to local economies. The closure of major border crossings in the Tuwal district has caused major economic losses for Saudis living in surrounding areas. The war has shown that residents of Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern cities and villages have not been shielded from the repercussions of Riyadh\u2019s intervention. The conflict has brought changes to the way that Saudis think, which will remain strongly present in the coming years.

After five years of a costly war, though, the Saudis may find themselves unable to continue funding its mercenaries in Yemen who have thus far failed to undermine Houthi-domination of the north and the capital Sanaa. Interestingly, some Islah supporters have recently taken to using an online hashtag campaign asking Turkey to intervene in Yemen. Earlier this year the Yemeni government had to deny allegations that it had signed an agreement with Turkey to manage its ports and transport infrastructure.", "Nevertheless, the Saudis appear to take Turkey\u2019s involvement seriously. Reports last week said that the coalition prevented a Turkish cargo plane carrying aid from landing in the southern port city of Aden.

Such a task will require, however, moving beyond the security-centered, international relations\u2019 frames of analysis prevalent in the available scholarly literature today. Present-day scholars and experts whose salaries are paid by the very regimes imposing this war may prove unhelpful in explaining the journalistic omerta future historians will wish to study.4", "The conventional narrative about the war unleashed by \u2018coalition\u2019 forces positions the US-led \u2018global community\u2019 as a benevolent agent simply aiming to reinstate the \u2018legitimate\u2019 presidency of one Abd-Rabbu Mansur Hadi for the sake of regional stability. Rarely highlighted any longer, this politically meek former vice president was the anointed partner to interests that, in reaction to uprisings in 2010\u20132011 against globalization, sought to suppress what is known as \u2018the Arab Spring\u2019 by imposing a reliable \u2018interim government.\u20195 Appointed in 2012 as an alternative to the no longer useful Ali Abdullah Saleh (president since 1978) and a barrier to \u2018radical\u2019 populist groups pushing for the reversal of austerity policies, the Obama and May administrations gave Hadi the task of continuing Yemen\u2019s highly unpopular integration into the global economy that had been interrupted by those 2010\u20132011 \u2018change\u2019 uprisings.", "Mischaracterized as \u2018support\u2019 for America\u2019s imposed counter-revolutionary solution, most of those protesting in 2011 were willing to give the US-directed process a chance considering they faced treats of perpetual violence from various factions vulnerable to populist demands for radical change. The trouble proved to be that Hadi\u2019s actual mandate was to push even more aggressively the very \u2018structural adjustments\u2019 against which Yemen\u2019s people protested in the first place. The violence and economic destitution this interim 2012\u20132014 period produced is all but forgotten in 2019. Such amnesia is critical as it makes it possible today for think tank employees to insinuate that there was no justification for Hadi\u2019s removal from the seat of the Yemeni government after his interim two-year period ended in mid-2014.", "While future readers of the extant analysis of Yemen will note that Hadi\u2019s arrest in late 2014 constitutes a \u2018coup\u2019 by \u2018Iranian-backed Houthi rebels,\u2019 rarely does the background to these events extend to acknowledging the justifications for the nation\u2019s collective outrage expressed against the IMF-austerity Hadi imposed. Indeed, if relying exclusively on the published material today, future historians will be strained to learn that Hadi\u2019s ready cooperation in the 2012\u20132014 period extended to implementing unpopular IMF and World Bank austerity programmes, tearing up previous leases benefiting UAE-based companies and granting new ones to Saudi and Qatari companies instead. In availing Yemen\u2019s primary assets to reliable American business partners, Yemen proved equally safe from China, which had secured with the previous Saleh government access to the country\u2019s agriculture, oil/gas and fisheries assets. Worse still for many who had originally formed in 2010\u20132011 a cross-sectional alliance to reverse Yemen\u2019s economic liquidation, Hadi and his American/Saudi/Qatar benefactors gave free reign to armed groups linked to Muslim Brotherhood affiliates known as Islah. Partnering with trusted members of the US-trained special units in the Yemeni army, foreign fighters and local loyalists actively chased down and murdered Yemeni leaders hostile to the globalist project they and Hadi\u2019s government were charged to impose.6", "In this respect, large numbers of Yemenis, be they in the North or South, recognized the US-backed Hadi project as a reactionary, neo-colonialist disaster that needed addressing. To those behind his arrest, a larger coalition of actors from across the political, socioeconomic and regional spectrum who were willing to take up arms to steer Yemen back toward real reform, the objectives of the interim government were clearly servicing outsiders\u2019 interests. Selling off Yemen\u2019s future to benefit the US Embassy were grounds for termination on perfectly logical patriotic, moral, and/or legal lines.

This situation is made even more complex by the increasing competition between different wings of the Houthi movement, and between local elites and the central regime, for the control of state institutions. Understanding political environments is key to ensuring an effective provision of humanitarian assistance. In Yemen, particularly, a thorough understanding of local elite networks is needed in order for humanitarians to engage with state actors in a way that is neutral, impartial, and independent.This report explores the history of the Houthi movement and the structure of the Houthi regime highlighting the need for nuanced and customised approaches to state authorities in different parts of Houthi-controlled Yemen.", "In Houthi-controlled territories, formal state authorities are systematically paralleled by the Houthi supervisory system. This \u2018shadow state\u2019 guarantees the control of the central regime over its peripheries, and the grip of the Houthi inner-circle over local elites of Houthi supporters (the mutahawwithin). As a result, decision-making does not necessarily lie with those actors who are formally representing the state (e.g. governors, ministers, security directors, etc.). Rather, it often lies with informal Houthi supervisors. Choosing one political interlocutor over another can make the difference and requires a thorough understanding of elite dynamics.", "Key Findings", "The supervisory system operates as a direct link between the inner circle of the Houthi leadership and the local governance system. Most Houthi general supervisors are Hashemites from the northern governorates, ideologically committed, and tied to the leadership by kinship and territory.", "Since December 2017, a gradual merging of formal institutions and the informal supervisory system is underway, with Houthi supervisors and loyalists appointed in state authorities. New state authorities, established outside of the law and placed under Houthi control, are making formal institutions redundant and ineffective.", "Houthi supervisors from the northern governorates and local elites of Houthi sympathisers (mutahawwithin) often compete for influence and the control of governorates\u2019 institutions.", "The regime's architecture is ever-evolving and volatile. State institutions and the supervisory system are increasingly merging, with the result that prominent Houthi leaders are now holding formal state positions.", "The relationship between the Houthi inner-circle and local elites shapes different configurations of power in each governorate.

This has been accompanied by ongoing, wide-ranging debates between Yemenis and Saudis over the details and trajectory of the war and how the Saudi intervention is seen by Saudi society. Most Saudi activists have adopted a similar discourse to that of the Saudi state, partly due to government censorship and intense monitoring of social media platforms, precluding any opposing voices. However, the level of debate shows how much attention Saudis have paid in recent years to news from Yemen, which has had a direct impact on their lives.", "The economic costs of Saudi involvement in the conflict alone have had major effects on Saudi society, in the form of tax hikes, raised fees for various services, and higher fuel prices. The conflict has also sparked a string of Houthi missile attacks against targets inside Saudi territory, sowing fear among ordinary Saudis and prompting many to start following the news from Yemen more closely.", "Totally forbidden from criticizing their government or critiquing its policies, Saudis writing on the war have focused on the country\u2019s enemy and limited their criticism of Saudi-backed actors in Yemen to questioning their seriousness and ability to achieve victory. The situation in Yemen has brought to prominence new Saudi writers, who have treated the subject as a safe topic for political commentary\u2014provided that they adopt the official narrative.", "Prior to the war, Yemen received hardly any attention in Saudi life.", "The kingdom\u2019s weak spot in this regard is its territory along the Yemen border, where the war has changed security arrangements and demography. When the war broke out in 2015, the Saudi government moved many residents of villages near the border to cities deeper inside Saudi Arabia, essentially turning the region into a buffer zone. This zone extends into Yemeni territory along the border, to a depth of between 10 and 40 kilometers toward Houthi-controlled territory. The goal of this was to prevent incursions into Saudi Arabia, especially as land clashes with the Houthis have dragged on.", "This shift in Saudi strategy in its southern region has had major repercussions for tribes along the frontier. Before it engaged the Houthis in military conflict, Saudi Arabia relied heavily on these tribes, both inside Saudi and Yemeni territory, to secure the long border.", "Throughout the current conflict Riyadh has relied on Yemeni conscripts\u2014by some estimates numbering as many as 60,000 fighters\u2014distributed across various fronts along the border. However, these fighters only make up the first line. Behind them are a multitude of military and security forces charged by the kingdom with securing its territories. Saudi Arabia has lost dozens of troops in the area due to clashes and artillery fire emanating from Houthi-held areas.", "As many as half the Saudi troops lost in these clashes hail from the southwestern border region, especially Jizan, upon whom Riyadh has relied heavily. These casualties have naturally had a social impact. Despite Saudi glorification of soldiers sacrificing their lives to guard the frontier, the losses have been deeply felt nationwide, especially in contrast to the stability that had reigned in previous decades.", "Fighting in certain border regions has also forced the closure of markets once vital to local economies. The closure of major border crossings in the Tuwal district has caused major economic losses for Saudis living in surrounding areas. The war has shown that residents of Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern cities and villages have not been shielded from the repercussions of Riyadh\u2019s intervention. The conflict has brought changes to the way that Saudis think, which will remain strongly present in the coming years.

The allegations against Ankara include Egypt\u2019s growing concerns such as Turkish \u201cinterference\u201d under the guise of humanitarian aid operating in three southern coastal regions and a joint \u201cQatar-Turkish plot\u201d to establish a militia recruitment camp in the Shabwa province.", "It is quite possible that these allegations contain half-truths or exaggerations and, according to Assistant Professor at Kings College London Dr Andreas Krieg, are a smokescreen to divert attention from the rise of the UAE-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) and the eventual fall of the Yemeni government-in-exile under President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.", "In the paradoxical world of Middle East alliances, Saudi Arabia is hostile to the Brotherhood and, along with the UAE, financed the military coup which overthrew Egypt\u2019s first civilian President Mohamed Morsi who was affiliated to the movement, and yet actively supports Al-Islah militia which function as Hadi\u2019s main fighting force on the ground against the Houthi-aligned Yemeni army.", "Turkey may well extend limited assistance to Al-Islah, but it is unlikely that the party will jeopardise its support from the Saudis. After five years of a costly war, though, the Saudis may find themselves unable to continue funding its mercenaries in Yemen who have thus far failed to undermine Houthi-domination of the north and the capital Sanaa. Interestingly, some Islah supporters have recently taken to using an online hashtag campaign asking Turkey to intervene in Yemen. Earlier this year the Yemeni government had to deny allegations that it had signed an agreement with Turkey to manage its ports and transport infrastructure.", "Nevertheless, the Saudis appear to take Turkey\u2019s involvement seriously. Reports last week said that the coalition prevented a Turkish cargo plane carrying aid from landing in the southern port city of Aden. Even so, in light of the ongoing conflict between Saudi-backed Al-Islah and UAE-supported STC forces in the south, if fears of Turkey\u2019s growing involvement are credible then it would be an ominous development for the UAE and its allied militias.", "The UAE has long been accused of attempting to annex the Yemeni island of Socotra to secure what it perceives to be its geopolitical interests in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
