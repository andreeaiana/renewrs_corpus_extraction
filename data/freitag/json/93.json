Yet, the general public and mass media in western countries have increasingly become aware of the situation and of the military deadlock up to the point it would now be wrong to continue asserting this war is happening behind closed doors. Information exists and is widely available. However, what probably remains hidden or silenced are Yemeni voices. These have a tendency to be either ignored or to see their claims confiscated by so\u2011called western experts. Willingly or not, they have been largely deprived of access to the public space and to debate on \u201ctheir\u201d war. Hence the frequent claim made that \u201cthere are no journalists in Yemen\u201d, actually meaning no Western ones! In the Arab media, the financial control of the Gulf states responsible for the bombing of the country itself has generated further biases and has often deprived Yemenis of their subjectivity.", "Thus Franck Mermier\u2019s editorial project to translate Arabic texts published by Yemeni intellectuals into French is a most opportune contribution.", "This Yemen focused\u2011publication helps correct a manifest injustice. \u201cIt seems we are not part of the world,\u201d writes journalist Jamal Jubran in a beautiful text made available here to the French speaking public. Beyond Franck Mermier's ambition to \u201cbreak the halo of aloofness\u201d and \u201cto destroy the wall of indifference that surrounds Yemen\u201d, the book project also needed to account for the complexity of what is unfolding in the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. It was in particular important to highlight the variety of positions and analyzes. Indeed, in Yemen perhaps more than elsewhere, society and the intellectual field remain fragmented to the extreme. Between supporters of the Houthi militia, Southern activists, socialists, liberals, Islamist and feminist voices, the narratives that can be delivered are frequently antagonistic.
