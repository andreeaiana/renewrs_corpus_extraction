Think, for instance, of that moment in the spring of 2003 when George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and crew launched the invasion of Iraq with dreams of setting up a Pax Americana across the Greater Middle East and beyond. By the time U.S. troops entered Baghdad, the burning and looting of the Iraqi capital had already begun, leaving the National Museum of Iraq trashed (gone were the tablets on which Hammurabi first had a code of laws inscribed) and the National Library of Baghdad, with its tens of thousands of ancient manuscripts, in flames. (No such \u201casteroid\u201d had hit that city since 1258, when Mongol warriors sacked it, destroying its many libraries and reputedly leaving the Tigris River running \u201cblack with ink\u201d and red with blood.)", "In truth, since 2003 the Greater Middle East has never stopped burning, as other militaries -- Afghan, Iranian, Iraqi, Israeli, Russian, Saudi, Syrian, Turkish -- entered the fray, insurgent groups rose, terror movements spread, and the U.S. military never left. By now, the asteroidal nature of American acts in the region should be beyond question. Consider, for example, the sainted retired general and former secretary of defense, Jim \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, the man who classically said of an Iraqi wedding party (including musicians) that his troops took out in 2004, \u201cHow many people go to the middle of the desert... to hold a wedding 80 miles from the nearest civilization?\u201d Or consider that, in the very same year, Mattis and the 1st Marine Division he commanded had just such an impact on the Iraqi city of Fallujah, leaving more than 75% of it in rubble.", "Or focus for a moment on the destruction caused by some combination of U.S. air power, ISIS suicide bombers, artillery, and mortars that, in seven months of fighting in 2017, uprooted more than a million people from the still largely un-reconstructed Iraqi city of Mosul (where 10 million tons of rubble are estimated to remain). Or try to bring to mind the rubblized city of Ramadi. Or consider the destruction of the Syrian city of Raqqa, the former \u201ccapital\u201d of ISIS\u2019s caliphate, left more than 80% \u201cuninhabitable\u201d after the U.S. (and allied) air forces dropped 20,000 bombs on it. All are versions of the same phenomenon.", "And yet when it comes to asteroids and the human future, one thing should be obvious. Such examples still represent relatively small-scale local impacts, given what\u2019s to come.", "The Wars From Hell", "If you happened to be an Afghan, Iraqi, Libyan, Syrian, Somali, or Yemeni in the twenty-first century, can there be any question that life would have seemed asteroidal to you? What Osama bin Laden began with just 19 fanatic followers and four hijacked commercial airliners the U.S. military continued across the Greater Middle East and North Africa as if it were the force from outer space (which, in a sense, it was). It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re talking about cities turned to rubble, civilians slaughtered, wedding parties obliterated, populations uprooted and sent into various forms of exile, the transformation of former nations (however autocratic) into failed states, or the spread of terrorism. It\u2019s been quite a story. More than 17 years and at least $5.6 trillion after the Bush administration launched its Global War on Terror, can there be any question that the wildest dreams of Osama bin Laden have been more than fulfilled? And it\u2019s not faintly over yet.", "More remarkable still, just about all of this has largely been ignored in the country that functionally made it so. If you asked most Americans, they would certainly know that almost 3,000 civilians were slaughtered in the terror attacks of 9/11, but how many (if any) would be aware of the several hundred civilians -- brides, grooms, revelers, you name it -- similarly slaughtered in what were, in essence, U.S. terror attacks against multiple wedding parties in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Yemen? And that\u2019s just to begin to mention the kinds of destruction that have gone on largely unnoticed here.", "In the first 18 years of this century, tens of millions of people have been uprooted and displaced -- more than 13 million in Syria alone -- from what had been their homes, lives, and worlds. Many of them were sent fleeing into countries like Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. Sooner or later, more than one million Syrians made it to Europe and 21,000 even made it to the United States. In the process, Washington\u2019s wars (and the conflicts that unfolded from them) unsettled ever more of the planet in much the way those particulates in the atmosphere did the world of 66 million years ago. So consider it an irony that, here in the U.S., so few connections have been made between such events and an unceasing series of American conflicts across the Greater Middle East and Africa -- or that the thought of even the mildest sorts of retreats from any of those battlegrounds instantly leaves political and national security elites in Washington (and the media that cover them) in an uproar of horror.", "Consider this a tale of imperial power gone awry that -- were anyone here truly paying attention -- could hardly have been uglier.

The report was apparently submitted to Congress last month but only released publicly when The Intercept published a copy of it last night. I had written that the report would present an opportunity for the administration to introduce some much-needed transparency surrounding the ongoing U.S.-Emirati counterterrorism campaign in Yemen and to make conclusively clear that the United States is not returning to the morally and legally dodgy days after 9/11. It does none of that. In a mere two pages of carefully parsed prose, the Department of Defense (DoD) has provided what can only be described as a deliberately misleading and deceptively evasive account of U.S. and Emirati actions in Yemen that amounts to the ultimate non-denial denial.", "DoD\u2019s report comes more than 18 months after the initial allegations of abuse emerged via Associated Press reporting and after Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the United Nations all conducted their own research and concluded the same. Yet despite this growing mountain of evidence, compiled by highly reputable sources, the DoD report variously hops from claims that the Department did not actually witness these abuses to reaffirming that of course the Department has standards in place to address abuses, but it does not ever directly address the core question of whether it thinks such abuses occurred, how much U.S. forces knew, and when they knew it. It\u2019s a lawyered-up document designed to obscure the truth and allow the administration to continue its increasingly problematic partnership with the Emiratis with no real oversight or pushback.", "The report provides a master class in obfuscatory policy and legal writing and is worth unpacking in full.", "The paragraph then states, \u201cDoD personnel have neither observed, nor been complicit in\u201d abuses.

The sentence concludes by saying that DoD personnel have not \u201cbeen complicit in\u201d such abuses, in the process totally glossing over the many possible gradations between not observing abuses and actively enabling them.", "The final section is where DoD descends into a full Khashoggi-like denial of the allegations.", "DOD takes detainee abuse allegations and the investigation of detainee abuse very seriously, whether it occurs in U.S. or foreign partner custody.

Abgewickelt werden die Lieferungen \u00fcber Werke auf Sardinien (Rheinmetall Waffe Munition Italia, RWM Italia) und in S\u00fcdafrika (Rheinmetall Denel Munition, RDM).[3] Die Bombenfabrik auf Sardinien wird ausgebaut; die Kooperation zwischen RDM und Saudi-Arabien wird intensiviert: Der noch recht junge saudische R\u00fcstungskonzern SAMI (Saudi Arabian Military Industries), der vom ehemaligen Rheinmetall-Manager Andreas Schwer gef\u00fchrt wird, will den s\u00fcdafrikanischen Denel-Konzern \u00fcbernehmen.

In mid-November, for example, a member of the Executive Board of Rheinmetall, the D\u00fcsseldorf-based armaments manufacturer, confirmed that his company supplies Saudi Arabia with war equipment worth more than 100 million euros a year via foreign subsidiaries.[2] This amount is not included in the Federal Government's Arms Export Report. Deliveries are handled via plants in Sardinia (Rheinmetall Waffe Munition Italia, RWM Italia) and South Africa (Rheinmetall Denel Munition, RDM).[3] The bomb factory in Sardinia is being expanded; the cooperation between RDM and Saudi Arabia is being intensified: SAMI (Saudi Arabian Military Industries), a relatively young Saudi defence group led by former Rheinmetall manager Andreas Schwer, acquires the South African Denel Group. In this context, he also aims to acquire Denel's 49 percent stake in RDM (german-foreign-policy.com reported [4]). SAMI itself has employed around a dozen German citizens, including at least three former Rheinmetall employees, to support the company in setting up its own weapons production facilities.[5] Unlike in the USA, for example, Germany allows the oral transfer of armaments know-how; this legal loophole enables the informal export of German weapons technology.", "Partner nations", "Products from German defence companies also reach Saudi Arabia via other European countries if they have been manufactured in jointly operated companies. This applies in particular to fighter jets. In March last year, Great Britain and Saudi Arabia agreed on the delivery of 48 Eurofighter aircraft. German armourers are involved in their manufacture. As the Federal Government confirms in a report to the Economic Committee of the Bundestag, \"no partner nation prevents the sale or approval of the sale of products or systems of the programme to third parties\"[6] The responsibility for the export of fighter jets can thus easily be shifted to Great Britain, which has already supplied the Eurofighters previously used by Saudi Arabia. Eurofighters and Tornados - also of German co-production - have been used in the Yemen war; the air strikes by Saudi pilots there have killed numerous civilians and are harshly criticised by human rights activists.[7] Saudi Arabia is also supplied with the necessary spare parts for the European fighter jets without which the Yemen war could not be waged.", "https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/posts/2086264581426561", "cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics", "(** B H)", "Ministry of Health Reveals Epidemiological Situation in Yemen in 2018", "The Yemeni Ministry of Health revealed a report showing the epidemiological situation in Yemen in 2018 and the prevalence of diseases.", "The Ministry reported that 2018 was a terrifying nightmare for people in Yemen who have been living in the throes of siege and aggression for 4 years.

Hodeidah is the second largest port in Yemen, and the only major port on the north-western coast. Yemen\u2019s dependence on imported goods is extremely high, the country\u2019s arid climate is unforgiving for crops \u2013 the total domestic production of cereal crops only meets 20% of the country\u2019s needs. And given this need for imports, it is no exaggeration to say that whoever controls Hodeidah controls the country\u2019s future. Moreover, any damage to the port during a fight would have devastating consequences. Even before the current conflict Yemen was highly food insecure, importing close to 90 percent of the food the population eats. Hodeidah is the gateway for the majority of these imports and currently receives more than 70 percent of all the commercial and humanitarian goods arriving to the country \u2014 including food, fuel and medicine.  UN agencies, humanitarian groups, and many others have pointed out that there is no viable way to make up for Hodeidah\u2019s import capacity if the port shuts down, given that it has the largest offloading and storage facilities in the country, and is the closest major port to Yemen\u2019s largest population centres.\" And it is not just damage to the port\u2019s infrastructure that could spark starvation.  Even if the port itself is not attacked, a siege of the city will likely force the port to close and thus sever this lifeline, aid agencies have been clear that even a brief disruption in deliveries, or the inability to access their storage facilities in Hodeidah, will put the lives of hundreds of thousands of people at risk.  Similarly, if commercial food deliveries to Hodeidah are interrupted, shortages and price spikes will ensue on the local market.

Think, for instance, of that moment in the spring of 2003 when George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and crew launched the invasion of Iraq with dreams of setting up a Pax Americana across the Greater Middle East and beyond. By the time U.S. troops entered Baghdad, the burning and looting of the Iraqi capital had already begun, leaving the National Museum of Iraq trashed (gone were the tablets on which Hammurabi first had a code of laws inscribed) and the National Library of Baghdad, with its tens of thousands of ancient manuscripts, in flames.

Or try to bring to mind the rubblized city of Ramadi.

Deliveries are handled via plants in Sardinia (Rheinmetall Waffe Munition Italia, RWM Italia) and South Africa (Rheinmetall Denel Munition, RDM).[3] The bomb factory in Sardinia is being expanded; the cooperation between RDM and Saudi Arabia is being intensified: SAMI (Saudi Arabian Military Industries), a relatively young Saudi defence group led by former Rheinmetall manager Andreas Schwer, acquires the South African Denel Group. In this context, he also aims to acquire Denel's 49 percent stake in RDM (german-foreign-policy.com reported [4]). SAMI itself has employed around a dozen German citizens, including at least three former Rheinmetall employees, to support the company in setting up its own weapons production facilities.[5] Unlike in the USA, for example, Germany allows the oral transfer of armaments know-how; this legal loophole enables the informal export of German weapons technology.", "Partner nations", "Products from German defence companies also reach Saudi Arabia via other European countries if they have been manufactured in jointly operated companies.

Even if the port itself is not attacked, a siege of the city will likely force the port to close and thus sever this lifeline, aid agencies have been clear that even a brief disruption in deliveries, or the inability to access their storage facilities in Hodeidah, will put the lives of hundreds of thousands of people at risk.
