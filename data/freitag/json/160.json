Hartung estimates that arms sales that have actually gone through since 2017 have likely only created 20,000 to 40,000 new jobs a year among the major defense companies, \u201cor less than one-tenth of President Trump\u2019s highest claims of employment tied to U.S. arms sales to the regime in Riyadh,\u201d writes Hartung.", "Furthermore, and this is key, he found that despite the $85.1 billion total arms sales in 2019, 10 percent involved licenses for production overseas, which means that many of the jobs that were created, were overseas, not here.
