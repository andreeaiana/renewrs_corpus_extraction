Through these reports, Bellingcat has drawn attention to a strategy of targeting densely populated locations by the Saudi-UAE led coalition in both Houthi and non-Houthi held territory. These investigations highlight a destructive pattern of attacks by the Saudi-led Coalition on densely populated markets, prisons, weddings and funerals in Yemen, leaving little to no accountability or acknowledgement in their wake.", "Methodology The methodology followed by the investigators was designed in collaboration with lawyers at the Global Legal Action Network.

It includes the use of technology which records all steps taken by the investigators to find evidence and immutably preserves the content relied on in the reports.

Using open-source information, researchers were unable to identify military targets in many of the strikes investigated in this cluster, calling into question the legitimacy of the attacks. However, even in light of identified military targets, the attacks on these locations appeared to kill and injure far more civilians than was proportionate to any likely military advantage. In some cases, such egregious civilian harm appears entirely foreseeable, suggesting that members of the Coalition have intentionally conducted indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks.", "Accountability", "In addition to markets, the coalition has demonstrated an alarming disregard for civilians by repeatedly targeting heavily populated areas such as large gatherings at weddings and funerals across the country.

This represented the first of a pattern of strikes where the coalition had struck prisons that were still operational.", "The Joint Incident Assessment Team (JIAT), a body established and run by the Saudi/UAE-led coalition in 2016 in response to claims of potential IHL violations, has been roundly condemned as ineffectual by Human Rights Watch and the United Nations Group of Eminent Experts.

Despite providing such immense military support, the UK and US have both neglected to independently investigate claims of international humanitarian law violations and potential war crimes, even where their arms have been directly tied to these incidents. This disregard for accountability has had devastating and far-reaching consequences on the civilian population in Yemen. The international community\u2019s continued supply of arms without qualification to the Saudi and UAE governments has enabled the coalition\u2019s repeated failure to push for accountability for violations of international law. As a consequence, failure to acknowledge civilian harm over the course of the conflict, has led to the continuation of airstrikes in densely populated areas. In the UK, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) has challenged the government\u2019s decision licence the export of military equipment to Saudi Arabia. On 20 June 2019 the Court of Appeal ruled that UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen are unlawful, however, despite overwhelming evidence and clear risk that UK weapons could be used in unlawful strikes, the UK government has appealed and is yet to make a decision on whether it will grant further arms licenses for sales to Saudi Arabia. Of significance to the government\u2019s new decision will be the steps the Coalition has taken to address alleged violations. Based on Bellingcat\u2019s investigations, such steps appear to have been purely token in nature and only forthcoming in response to overwhelming international outrage.

The Houthis surely understand that it is the UAE and Saudi Arabia, not Iran, that will be funding the bulk of Yemen\u2019s post-conflict reconstruction, and the two countries will therefore possess political leverage that is beyond Iran\u2019s capabilities.", "Likewise, Iran is not inclined to maintain the same level of support for the Houthis after the war ends.
