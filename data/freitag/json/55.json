Long seen as the cultural heart of the country, Taiz emerged in early 2015 as the center of what many observers describe as a proxy war between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis, an armed Zaidi Shia revivalist movement with ties to Iran.", "The current military situation in Taiz is a stalemate between the Houthis and a diverse, loosely formed coalition of anti-Houthi groups. Having surrounded and besieged the city of Taiz, the Houthis remain in control of most of its entrances and exits, controlling the passage of goods and people along with a strategically critical north-south gateway. The conflict in Taiz is emblematic of the way regional rivalries between Gulf States and Iran and hyperlocal competition for power and influence have played out and intersected across Yemen.", "Foreign powers play an important role in the conflict by seeking to impose their own goals through sponsorship of armed factions and political groups. As a strategic location abutting Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern border and the shipping lanes of the Red Sea, Yemen holds importance for several foreign powers\u2019 regional agendas. This has led many commentators to analyze the conflict through the lens of proxy warfare.", "Yet this lens can easily misrepresent the war as one in which Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and Iran move their proxies like chess pieces seeking comparative advantage, while also reducing the war as a whole to these movements. It is not only a matter of misdiagnosing the dynamics involved; framing the conflict as primarily a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia complicates efforts to resolve the conflict. The framing provides strategic advantages for many of the belligerent parties who use it to fuel their war efforts. The narrative itself further internationalizes the conflict, obscuring the essential nature of the war in Yemen, which is at heart an internal Yemeni political conflict.", "The internationalization of what was originally a domestic political struggle has made the conflict more complex, in turn making it more difficult to resolve, but it has not fundamentally altered the goals of the original domestic combatants. If the war is ever to end, the goals of Yemenis must be recognized for what they are, and elevated in importance above those of the international parties to the conflict.", "Key Findings:", "Various military forces in Yemen use the proxy war frame as a propaganda tool to recruit and raise funds, but the day-to-day experience of the conflict is highly local. In many cases, rather than a top-down proxy relationship of control, local forces exercise substantial agency despite receiving sponsorship, pursuing their own interests and using foreign sponsorship opportunities for their own purposes.", "The complex web of forces and sponsorship opportunities has empowered individuals\u2014in addition to groups\u2014to act as major players in Yemen\u2019s war. Abu al-Abbas, the leader of the Abu al-Abbas Brigades, for example, skillfully drew on Saudi, Emirati, local, and potentially al-Qaida support to drive his rise in influence.", "Though the Houthis have increasingly aligned with Iran, they continue to enmesh themselves in Yemen\u2019s wider body politic. Prior to the current war, the Houthis waged six wars against the Yemeni government in the twenty-first century, during which there is little evidence of firm Iranian command and control. Iran\u2019s reported provision of missiles and drones shapes the conflict, but its roots are local and would not disappear were Iran to fully abandon the Houthis.", "Foreign powers\u2019 development of proxy relationships in the form of external sponsorship has made the conflict more complex and difficult to resolve via negotiations. Such foreign relationships have resulted in an interplay between an expanded and shifting set of local forces, national political factions, and international parties, each of which have their own interests and aims. This expanded set of armed and political groups fuels tensions and complicates efforts to end the violence through a negotiated settlement.", "Uncritical adoption of the proxy war narrative poses challenges for peacemakers and policymakers, increasing the risks of escalation and frustrating efforts at conflict resolution.

Most important for the Yemeni people, the war needs to end with either a transitional council or elections so that a future leader enjoys the popular legitimacy Hadi lacks.", "Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi was selected as a temporary president during a moment of national and regional consensus in 2012, following the protracted Arab Spring crisis in Yemen that led to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh\u2019s departure from power.

This study examines what might happen when he departs the scene.", "Given the role the current government has played in the war, a change at the top will almost certainly be necessary either in the transitional process or through a post-transition election. The current president\u2019s legitimacy derives from a UN- and Gulf Cooperation Counci\u2013agreed framework, not from the loyalty of followers or control of a unified military.

This process, however, was interrupted in September 2014 by the Houthi march into Sana and the rebel group\u2019s eventual takeover of the state in early 2015", "By March 2015, when the civil war began, Hadi had been serving for three years, a year longer than anticipated in the GCC initiative. Those who had supported extending his term beyond the two years had based their view on a reading of the initiative that bound the timeframe to tasks rather than a set period. The initiative did not spell out what would happen if the process to elections lasted longer than two years, so it was on this basis that Hadi remained president when the Houthis occupied Sana.", "As a result of this unusual situation, some Yemenis contest Hadi\u2019s legal legitimacy altogether. They point out that he was only supposed to be president for two years\u2014until February 2014\u2014and that his extension was without either an election or a negotiated settlement. Even those who accept the one-year extension point out that his term should have ended in February 2015, a month before the start of the current war.", "Hadi is thus a president without a constituency and without the levers of a state, yet his embodiment as the Legitimacy has provided Saudi Arabia\u2019s justification for carrying out the war.", "There are two general ways a transition to the next leader of Yemen could occur: first, through a domestic and internationally agreed-upon process, perhaps as part of a peace deal to end the war, or second, as an involuntary rupture through death, a serious health matter, or forced removal\u2014all of which might precipitate a constitutional crisis.", "Whatever the transitional phase looks like\u2014and whatever Hadi\u2019s role in it\u2014the main parties to the conflict agree notionally that a transitional government would be replaced through an election process, likely one or two years after the start of a peace agreement.", "A constitutional crisis or the rise of a controversial figure like Ali Mohsen to the presidency might reorient the chess pieces in Yemen, providing either an opportunity for alternative solutions to the war or prompting further entrenchment.

We let our ambitions outstrip the practical possibilities of a region where perfect is rarely on the menu, and second- and third-order consequences are rarely uplifting.

Instead, we need a significant shift in the terms of our engagement in the region\u2014lowering our expectations for transformation, ending our habit of indulging the worst instincts of our partners and engaging in cosmic confrontation with state adversaries, finding a more focused and sustainable approach to counterterrorism, and putting more emphasis on diplomacy backed up by military leverage, instead of the other way around.", "[\u2026]", "Second, we need to recalibrate our relationships across the region in order to contribute to some long-term semblance of order.

Long seen as the cultural heart of the country, Taiz emerged in early 2015 as the center of what many observers describe as a proxy war between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis, an armed Zaidi Shia revivalist movement with ties to Iran.", "The current military situation in Taiz is a stalemate between the Houthis and a diverse, loosely formed coalition of anti-Houthi groups. Having surrounded and besieged the city of Taiz, the Houthis remain in control of most of its entrances and exits, controlling the passage of goods and people along with a strategically critical north-south gateway. The conflict in Taiz is emblematic of the way regional rivalries between Gulf States and Iran and hyperlocal competition for power and influence have played out and intersected across Yemen.", "Foreign powers play an important role in the conflict by seeking to impose their own goals through sponsorship of armed factions and political groups. As a strategic location abutting Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern border and the shipping lanes of the Red Sea, Yemen holds importance for several foreign powers\u2019 regional agendas. This has led many commentators to analyze the conflict through the lens of proxy warfare.", "Yet this lens can easily misrepresent the war as one in which Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and Iran move their proxies like chess pieces seeking comparative advantage, while also reducing the war as a whole to these movements. It is not only a matter of misdiagnosing the dynamics involved; framing the conflict as primarily a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia complicates efforts to resolve the conflict. The framing provides strategic advantages for many of the belligerent parties who use it to fuel their war efforts. The narrative itself further internationalizes the conflict, obscuring the essential nature of the war in Yemen, which is at heart an internal Yemeni political conflict.", "The internationalization of what was originally a domestic political struggle has made the conflict more complex, in turn making it more difficult to resolve, but it has not fundamentally altered the goals of the original domestic combatants. If the war is ever to end, the goals of Yemenis must be recognized for what they are, and elevated in importance above those of the international parties to the conflict.", "Key Findings:", "Various military forces in Yemen use the proxy war frame as a propaganda tool to recruit and raise funds, but the day-to-day experience of the conflict is highly local. In many cases, rather than a top-down proxy relationship of control, local forces exercise substantial agency despite receiving sponsorship, pursuing their own interests and using foreign sponsorship opportunities for their own purposes.", "The complex web of forces and sponsorship opportunities has empowered individuals\u2014in addition to groups\u2014to act as major players in Yemen\u2019s war. Abu al-Abbas, the leader of the Abu al-Abbas Brigades, for example, skillfully drew on Saudi, Emirati, local, and potentially al-Qaida support to drive his rise in influence.", "Though the Houthis have increasingly aligned with Iran, they continue to enmesh themselves in Yemen\u2019s wider body politic. Prior to the current war, the Houthis waged six wars against the Yemeni government in the twenty-first century, during which there is little evidence of firm Iranian command and control. Iran\u2019s reported provision of missiles and drones shapes the conflict, but its roots are local and would not disappear were Iran to fully abandon the Houthis.", "Foreign powers\u2019 development of proxy relationships in the form of external sponsorship has made the conflict more complex and difficult to resolve via negotiations. Such foreign relationships have resulted in an interplay between an expanded and shifting set of local forces, national political factions, and international parties, each of which have their own interests and aims. This expanded set of armed and political groups fuels tensions and complicates efforts to end the violence through a negotiated settlement.", "Uncritical adoption of the proxy war narrative poses challenges for peacemakers and policymakers, increasing the risks of escalation and frustrating efforts at conflict resolution. The narrative obscures the true localized nature of the conflict and ignores the goals and ambitions of key domestic stakeholders.", "These wider divisions have dragged out the battle against the Houthis while providing growth opportunities to extremist groups like al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Al-Qaida\u2019s strength has diminished recently and its power should not be exaggerated, but the group stands to benefit from persistent conflict \u2013 by Adam Baron and Raiman Al-Hamdani", "https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/reports/the-proxy-war-prism-on-yemen/", "(** B P)", "A Caretaker President Clings to Legitimacy in Yemen", "Back in 2012, during a moment of national and regional consensus, the reserved, nonthreatening Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi was chosen as a temporary president. But Hadi, now seventy-four years old, has held onto power ever since, despite lacking a large base of domestic loyalists. Most important for the Yemeni people, the war needs to end with either a transitional council or elections so that a future leader enjoys the popular legitimacy Hadi lacks.", "Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi was selected as a temporary president during a moment of national and regional consensus in 2012, following the protracted Arab Spring crisis in Yemen that led to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh\u2019s departure from power. Hadi has remained president well past his expected two-year term, overseeing a war with the Houthi rebel group primarily in the north and a conflict with secessionists in the south. This study examines what might happen when he departs the scene.", "Given the role the current government has played in the war, a change at the top will almost certainly be necessary either in the transitional process or through a post-transition election. The current president\u2019s legitimacy derives from a UN- and Gulf Cooperation Counci\u2013agreed framework, not from the loyalty of followers or control of a unified military. Moreover, Hadi is in the somewhat paradoxical position of being a southerner leading a government that faces a renewed secessionist movement among southerners, further confusing his legitimacy in the public\u2019s eyes", "Underpinning Hadi\u2019s legitimacy\u2014unusually, by name\u2014are the GCC initiative of 2011, its implementation mechanism, and UN Security Council Resolution 2216 (2015).4 According to the GCC initiative, which followed Saleh\u2019s resignation, the parties in Yemen committed \u201cnot to nominate or endorse any candidate for the early presidential elections except for the consensus candidate Vice-President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi.\u201d5 Hadi was meant to serve as a transitional president who would oversee the National Dialogue Process, the writing of a new constitution, and the restructuring of the military, then oversee elections that would almost certainly unseat him. This process, however, was interrupted in September 2014 by the Houthi march into Sana and the rebel group\u2019s eventual takeover of the state in early 2015", "By March 2015, when the civil war began, Hadi had been serving for three years, a year longer than anticipated in the GCC initiative. Those who had supported extending his term beyond the two years had based their view on a reading of the initiative that bound the timeframe to tasks rather than a set period. The initiative did not spell out what would happen if the process to elections lasted longer than two years, so it was on this basis that Hadi remained president when the Houthis occupied Sana.", "As a result of this unusual situation, some Yemenis contest Hadi\u2019s legal legitimacy altogether. They point out that he was only supposed to be president for two years\u2014until February 2014\u2014and that his extension was without either an election or a negotiated settlement. Even those who accept the one-year extension point out that his term should have ended in February 2015, a month before the start of the current war.", "Hadi is thus a president without a constituency and without the levers of a state, yet his embodiment as the Legitimacy has provided Saudi Arabia\u2019s justification for carrying out the war.", "There are two general ways a transition to the next leader of Yemen could occur: first, through a domestic and internationally agreed-upon process, perhaps as part of a peace deal to end the war, or second, as an involuntary rupture through death, a serious health matter, or forced removal\u2014all of which might precipitate a constitutional crisis.", "Whatever the transitional phase looks like\u2014and whatever Hadi\u2019s role in it\u2014the main parties to the conflict agree notionally that a transitional government would be replaced through an election process, likely one or two years after the start of a peace agreement.", "A constitutional crisis or the rise of a controversial figure like Ali Mohsen to the presidency might reorient the chess pieces in Yemen, providing either an opportunity for alternative solutions to the war or prompting further entrenchment.

Despite important achievements, we all too often misread regional currents and mismatched ends and means. In our episodic missionary zeal, especially after the terrible jolt to our system on 9/11, we tended to overreach militarily and underinvest diplomatically. We let our ambitions outstrip the practical possibilities of a region where perfect is rarely on the menu, and second- and third-order consequences are rarely uplifting.

Our moment as the singular dominant outside player in the Middle East has faded, but we still have a solid hand to play. The key to playing it well will be neither restoration of the inflated ambition and over-militarization of much of the post-9/11 period nor sweeping disengagement. Instead, we need a significant shift in the terms of our engagement in the region\u2014lowering our expectations for transformation, ending our habit of indulging the worst instincts of our partners and engaging in cosmic confrontation with state adversaries, finding a more focused and sustainable approach to counterterrorism, and putting more emphasis on diplomacy backed up by military leverage, instead of the other way around.", "[\u2026]", "Second, we need to recalibrate our relationships across the region in order to contribute to some long-term semblance of order.

Long seen as the cultural heart of the country, Taiz emerged in early 2015 as the center of what many observers describe as a proxy war between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis, an armed Zaidi Shia revivalist movement with ties to Iran.", "The current military situation in Taiz is a stalemate between the Houthis and a diverse, loosely formed coalition of anti-Houthi groups. Having surrounded and besieged the city of Taiz, the Houthis remain in control of most of its entrances and exits, controlling the passage of goods and people along with a strategically critical north-south gateway. The conflict in Taiz is emblematic of the way regional rivalries between Gulf States and Iran and hyperlocal competition for power and influence have played out and intersected across Yemen.", "Foreign powers play an important role in the conflict by seeking to impose their own goals through sponsorship of armed factions and political groups. As a strategic location abutting Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern border and the shipping lanes of the Red Sea, Yemen holds importance for several foreign powers\u2019 regional agendas. This has led many commentators to analyze the conflict through the lens of proxy warfare.", "Yet this lens can easily misrepresent the war as one in which Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and Iran move their proxies like chess pieces seeking comparative advantage, while also reducing the war as a whole to these movements. It is not only a matter of misdiagnosing the dynamics involved; framing the conflict as primarily a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia complicates efforts to resolve the conflict. The framing provides strategic advantages for many of the belligerent parties who use it to fuel their war efforts. The narrative itself further internationalizes the conflict, obscuring the essential nature of the war in Yemen, which is at heart an internal Yemeni political conflict.", "The internationalization of what was originally a domestic political struggle has made the conflict more complex, in turn making it more difficult to resolve, but it has not fundamentally altered the goals of the original domestic combatants. If the war is ever to end, the goals of Yemenis must be recognized for what they are, and elevated in importance above those of the international parties to the conflict.", "Key Findings:", "Various military forces in Yemen use the proxy war frame as a propaganda tool to recruit and raise funds, but the day-to-day experience of the conflict is highly local. In many cases, rather than a top-down proxy relationship of control, local forces exercise substantial agency despite receiving sponsorship, pursuing their own interests and using foreign sponsorship opportunities for their own purposes.", "The complex web of forces and sponsorship opportunities has empowered individuals\u2014in addition to groups\u2014to act as major players in Yemen\u2019s war.

Prior to the current war, the Houthis waged six wars against the Yemeni government in the twenty-first century, during which there is little evidence of firm Iranian command and control. Iran\u2019s reported provision of missiles and drones shapes the conflict, but its roots are local and would not disappear were Iran to fully abandon the Houthis.", "Foreign powers\u2019 development of proxy relationships in the form of external sponsorship has made the conflict more complex and difficult to resolve via negotiations.

Those who had supported extending his term beyond the two years had based their view on a reading of the initiative that bound the timeframe to tasks rather than a set period. The initiative did not spell out what would happen if the process to elections lasted longer than two years, so it was on this basis that Hadi remained president when the Houthis occupied Sana.", "As a result of this unusual situation, some Yemenis contest Hadi\u2019s legal legitimacy altogether. They point out that he was only supposed to be president for two years\u2014until February 2014\u2014and that his extension was without either an election or a negotiated settlement. Even those who accept the one-year extension point out that his term should have ended in February 2015, a month before the start of the current war.", "Hadi is thus a president without a constituency and without the levers of a state, yet his embodiment as the Legitimacy has provided Saudi Arabia\u2019s justification for carrying out the war.", "There are two general ways a transition to the next leader of Yemen could occur: first, through a domestic and internationally agreed-upon process, perhaps as part of a peace deal to end the war, or second, as an involuntary rupture through death, a serious health matter, or forced removal\u2014all of which might precipitate a constitutional crisis.", "Whatever the transitional phase looks like\u2014and whatever Hadi\u2019s role in it\u2014the main parties to the conflict agree notionally that a transitional government would be replaced through an election process, likely one or two years after the start of a peace agreement.", "A constitutional crisis or the rise of a controversial figure like Ali Mohsen to the presidency might reorient the chess pieces in Yemen, providing either an opportunity for alternative solutions to the war or prompting further entrenchment.

Long seen as the cultural heart of the country, Taiz emerged in early 2015 as the center of what many observers describe as a proxy war between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis, an armed Zaidi Shia revivalist movement with ties to Iran.", "The current military situation in Taiz is a stalemate between the Houthis and a diverse, loosely formed coalition of anti-Houthi groups. Having surrounded and besieged the city of Taiz, the Houthis remain in control of most of its entrances and exits, controlling the passage of goods and people along with a strategically critical north-south gateway. The conflict in Taiz is emblematic of the way regional rivalries between Gulf States and Iran and hyperlocal competition for power and influence have played out and intersected across Yemen.", "Foreign powers play an important role in the conflict by seeking to impose their own goals through sponsorship of armed factions and political groups. As a strategic location abutting Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern border and the shipping lanes of the Red Sea, Yemen holds importance for several foreign powers\u2019 regional agendas. This has led many commentators to analyze the conflict through the lens of proxy warfare.", "Yet this lens can easily misrepresent the war as one in which Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and Iran move their proxies like chess pieces seeking comparative advantage, while also reducing the war as a whole to these movements. It is not only a matter of misdiagnosing the dynamics involved; framing the conflict as primarily a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia complicates efforts to resolve the conflict. The framing provides strategic advantages for many of the belligerent parties who use it to fuel their war efforts. The narrative itself further internationalizes the conflict, obscuring the essential nature of the war in Yemen, which is at heart an internal Yemeni political conflict.", "The internationalization of what was originally a domestic political struggle has made the conflict more complex, in turn making it more difficult to resolve, but it has not fundamentally altered the goals of the original domestic combatants. If the war is ever to end, the goals of Yemenis must be recognized for what they are, and elevated in importance above those of the international parties to the conflict.", "Key Findings:", "Various military forces in Yemen use the proxy war frame as a propaganda tool to recruit and raise funds, but the day-to-day experience of the conflict is highly local. In many cases, rather than a top-down proxy relationship of control, local forces exercise substantial agency despite receiving sponsorship, pursuing their own interests and using foreign sponsorship opportunities for their own purposes.", "The complex web of forces and sponsorship opportunities has empowered individuals\u2014in addition to groups\u2014to act as major players in Yemen\u2019s war. Abu al-Abbas, the leader of the Abu al-Abbas Brigades, for example, skillfully drew on Saudi, Emirati, local, and potentially al-Qaida support to drive his rise in influence.", "Though the Houthis have increasingly aligned with Iran, they continue to enmesh themselves in Yemen\u2019s wider body politic. Prior to the current war, the Houthis waged six wars against the Yemeni government in the twenty-first century, during which there is little evidence of firm Iranian command and control. Iran\u2019s reported provision of missiles and drones shapes the conflict, but its roots are local and would not disappear were Iran to fully abandon the Houthis.", "Foreign powers\u2019 development of proxy relationships in the form of external sponsorship has made the conflict more complex and difficult to resolve via negotiations. Such foreign relationships have resulted in an interplay between an expanded and shifting set of local forces, national political factions, and international parties, each of which have their own interests and aims. This expanded set of armed and political groups fuels tensions and complicates efforts to end the violence through a negotiated settlement.", "Uncritical adoption of the proxy war narrative poses challenges for peacemakers and policymakers, increasing the risks of escalation and frustrating efforts at conflict resolution. The narrative obscures the true localized nature of the conflict and ignores the goals and ambitions of key domestic stakeholders.", "These wider divisions have dragged out the battle against the Houthis while providing growth opportunities to extremist groups like al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

But Hadi, now seventy-four years old, has held onto power ever since, despite lacking a large base of domestic loyalists. Most important for the Yemeni people, the war needs to end with either a transitional council or elections so that a future leader enjoys the popular legitimacy Hadi lacks.", "Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi was selected as a temporary president during a moment of national and regional consensus in 2012, following the protracted Arab Spring crisis in Yemen that led to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh\u2019s departure from power. Hadi has remained president well past his expected two-year term, overseeing a war with the Houthi rebel group primarily in the north and a conflict with secessionists in the south. This study examines what might happen when he departs the scene.", "Given the role the current government has played in the war, a change at the top will almost certainly be necessary either in the transitional process or through a post-transition election. The current president\u2019s legitimacy derives from a UN- and Gulf Cooperation Counci\u2013agreed framework, not from the loyalty of followers or control of a unified military. Moreover, Hadi is in the somewhat paradoxical position of being a southerner leading a government that faces a renewed secessionist movement among southerners, further confusing his legitimacy in the public\u2019s eyes", "Underpinning Hadi\u2019s legitimacy\u2014unusually, by name\u2014are the GCC initiative of 2011, its implementation mechanism, and UN Security Council Resolution 2216 (2015).4 According to the GCC initiative, which followed Saleh\u2019s resignation, the parties in Yemen committed \u201cnot to nominate or endorse any candidate for the early presidential elections except for the consensus candidate Vice-President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi.\u201d5 Hadi was meant to serve as a transitional president who would oversee the National Dialogue Process, the writing of a new constitution, and the restructuring of the military, then oversee elections that would almost certainly unseat him. This process, however, was interrupted in September 2014 by the Houthi march into Sana and the rebel group\u2019s eventual takeover of the state in early 2015", "By March 2015, when the civil war began, Hadi had been serving for three years, a year longer than anticipated in the GCC initiative. Those who had supported extending his term beyond the two years had based their view on a reading of the initiative that bound the timeframe to tasks rather than a set period. The initiative did not spell out what would happen if the process to elections lasted longer than two years, so it was on this basis that Hadi remained president when the Houthis occupied Sana.", "As a result of this unusual situation, some Yemenis contest Hadi\u2019s legal legitimacy altogether. They point out that he was only supposed to be president for two years\u2014until February 2014\u2014and that his extension was without either an election or a negotiated settlement. Even those who accept the one-year extension point out that his term should have ended in February 2015, a month before the start of the current war.", "Hadi is thus a president without a constituency and without the levers of a state, yet his embodiment as the Legitimacy has provided Saudi Arabia\u2019s justification for carrying out the war.", "There are two general ways a transition to the next leader of Yemen could occur: first, through a domestic and internationally agreed-upon process, perhaps as part of a peace deal to end the war, or second, as an involuntary rupture through death, a serious health matter, or forced removal\u2014all of which might precipitate a constitutional crisis.", "Whatever the transitional phase looks like\u2014and whatever Hadi\u2019s role in it\u2014the main parties to the conflict agree notionally that a transitional government would be replaced through an election process, likely one or two years after the start of a peace agreement.", "A constitutional crisis or the rise of a controversial figure like Ali Mohsen to the presidency might reorient the chess pieces in Yemen, providing either an opportunity for alternative solutions to the war or prompting further entrenchment.

However, the role of media in the news construction and framing of the Yemeni Uprising in particular has been less wellexamined; that is perhaps attributed to the fact that Yemen\u2019s sociopolitical features are complex, and it is often an intimidating task to analyse the media\u2019s interrelation with the country\u2019s political developments. Hence, in tackling this gap, this thesis focuses on the first stage of Yemen\u2019s 2011 Uprising and how media portrayed it, by specifically displaying a comparative analysis between the BBC World and Al Jazeera English onlinepublished articles during the first 100 days of the Yemeni uprising.
