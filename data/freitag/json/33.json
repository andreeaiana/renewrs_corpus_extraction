However, such dire conditions have not stood in the way of young people across the country seeking to contribute to restoring and building peace in their war-torn country, as they play vital and positive roles in different sectors for the purpose of not only helping to voice people\u2019s hopes and de- sire to live in a stable and safe state, but also in cementing solid ground and the foundation for sustainable peace.", "Despite its major transformative potential, local level youth work is often overlooked by mainstream international discourses on national level peace processes and violent conflict.* This Brief sheds light on young peoples\u2019 activism before and during the war, the challenges they are currently facing, their visions for the future of Yemen and the kind of support they need. The contributions of young men and women to the economy, politics, culture and so- city, education, security and justice, and the environment show how youth are laying the groundwork for peace and social cohesion in their communities.", "From Introduction", "Youth activists are facing a wide range of seemingly insurmountable challenges \u2013 from a failing economy and a collapse in educational opportunities through to direct security threats and restrictions on their speech and movements. Even so, large numbers of youth across the country have sought out ways to positively contribute, particularly at community level, finding new spaces and new ways of working.", "Travel restrictions have forced activism to the local and community level, and the security situation has shifted the focus of youth to supporting humanitarian, health, environ- mental and social causes rather than overtly \u2018political\u2019 work.4 Youth initiatives are pro- viding public services amid collapsing state services and a lack of international development projects. The types of work that youth engage in vary significantly from one governorate to another, influenced by the level of direct conflict in their area, the attitudes and behaviors of the local de facto authorities, and the amount of support being received from the international community.", "Young men and women in rural and urban areas see their potential to positively contribute to peacebuilding across six areas specified above: the economy, politics, culture and society, security and justice, education and the environment. Many youth believe that small, community-level contributions are significant in themselves, as they contribute to building relationships and social cohesion in their communities; lay stepping stones to sustainable peace in the longer term; and reduce the cycle of violence by providing productive opportunities for young men and women outside of violence.", "https://carpo-bonn.org/portfolio/carpo-ypc-brief-17-the-role-of-youth-in-peacebuilding-in-yemen/", "cp1a Am wichtigsten: Coronavirus und Seuchen / Most important: Coronavirus and epidemics", "(* A H)", "B\u00fcrgerkriegsland Jemen meldet die ersten beiden Corona-Toten", "Der Jemen hat als letztes Land auf der Arabischen Halbinsel seiner ersten beiden Corona-Toten gemeldet.

The air raids did not succeed and the Houthis continued to control Sana'a and most of the densely populated northern governorates. During the war, epidemics broke out in the country, making it the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.", "There has been no significant change in the military map since the beginning of 2018 and the forces remained in their positions in the same fighting fronts until March 2020, when the Houthis took control of the city of Al-Hazm, the center of the strategic Al-Jawf governorate, north of the country, on border with Saudi Arabia, threatening the Yemeni government stronghold in Marib governorate.", "The Houthis started military escalation, despite the United Nations peace calls for ceasefire in Yemen in order to fight the Coronavirus. Several changes have made the Corona pandemic an opportunity to reach a peace agreement in the country.

Those indicators include the following:", "Exploiting the Pandemic", "Local and international parties are taking advantage of the ceasefire and the Coronavirus to implement war-related plans or \"legitimacy of survival\" as follows:", "Secondly: The impact of Coronavirus on the public health system and humanitarian situation in Yemen", "From the perspective of the spread of the Corona epidemic in other countries, the virus is very dangerous. Yemen represents a refreshing environment for Coronavirus and there are many factors that may help in spreading out the pandemic with a high average of infections and deaths: a large population (approximately 30 million), a poor health care system, the years-long war that exhausted the population and made the situation the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, and the country's population has become very dependent and unable to live without assistance from outside. Almost 24.1 million depend on foreign assistance and other 14.3 million are in dire need of aid.[18] Millions are on the brink of starvation and hundreds of thousands of children suffer from malnutrition and acute malnutrition, which means that the natural immunity to Coronavirus is not sufficient in a war-torn country like Yemen.", "The country is already suffering from high levels of malnutrition and epidemic diseases such as cholera due to the ongoing war, which increased up to 132 percent last year, compared to 2018. More than 56,000 suspected cases were registered in the first seven weeks of 2020.[19] The number is likely to rise further during the rainy season in Yemen that started in April.[20]", "Yemen confirmed its first case of coronavirus on April 11, 2020 in Hadramawt, southeastern Yemen, the country's largest governorate. United Nations and relief officials believe that the virus is likely to have spread more widely, and that the increase of infections in Saudi Arabia reinforces these doubts.[21]", "It is difficult to know exactly about Coronavirus in Yemen because of the limited number of testing laboratories and people\u2019s fears of reporting. The virus is likely to spread among Yemenis before the authorities realize its existence in the country. The prevalence of the virus is possible due to poor living conditions, lack of personal protective equipment, population density, the difficulty in applying hygiene behaviors and the culture of social distancing in a society that sanctifies the social gatherings and people go to the khat markets every day, making the enforcement of containment measures so difficult.", "Obstacles to Coronavirus fight", "Countering Coronavirus:", "Third: The Economic Situation", "The country's economy collapsed during war, according to official estimates, and Yemen lost fifty billion dollars during the period (2015-2019).[32] The World Bank estimates that Yemen's GDP has shrunk by nearly 50% since 2014. In the first quarter of 2020, the economic predictions indicate that total economic conditions are likely to continue to deteriorate.[33]", "It is difficult for the authorities and researchers to estimate the size of the economic losses in light of the current situation of the conflict and the parallel \u201cwar economy\u201d activity, which seems to be a great driver of the economy in the country.

It is possible to begin with a temporary truce for several months to devote efforts to confront Corona and its expected catastrophic consequences. This step will only be achieved through concessions from the two parties of the war to reach a final formula that gives priority for health services and the economic development through forming joint specialized committees that manage these files.

The disappointing turn comes after Houthi forces in the north refused to join a Saudi ceasefire on April 9, instead continuing their push toward the government\u2019s resource-rich stronghold in Marib province.", "This double blow is a watershed in a months-long experiment that has put Saudi Arabia at the helm of negotiations in Yemen. Last fall, the kingdom began direct talks with the Houthis and took over responsibility for patching up disputes between the Hadi government and STC.

Each of these parties has relationships or capabilities that can facilitate Saudi efforts", "The urgency of such cooperation has grown because events are moving faster than Riyadh\u2019s decisionmaking. The focus should therefore shift to corralling international partners whose combined relationships can better incentivize Yemen\u2019s factions to reach a peaceful resolution.

And of course, it's many years later and they're still in the quagmire making absolutely no notable progress, very much like the Americans in Vietnam. In both cases, these wars have inflicted horrific suffering on civilian populations.", "Another comparison between Yemen and Vietnam is that in both cases, we had an empire, very, very wealthy aggressive empire, trying to extend its power versus local troops who were fighting for local self-determination whether it's the Vietnamese fighting for an independent Vietnam, or the Yemenis fighting for an independent Yemen. And in both cases, these wars happened just as there was an economic shock around the world oil trade happening", "The economic shock around the US being unable to come up with enough gold to supply the demands for gold by people who wanted to trade in their dollars for gold especially the French was part of the reason that it became clear the US couldn't afford to continue trying to win in Vietnam. Today we're seeing something similar, except now, it's the petrodollar standard that is collapsing as the US is being challenged geo-politically and economically by independent nations led by China, and, of course, Russia and Iran as well.", "So, the Saudi quagmire in Yemen is very similar to the US quagmire in Vietnam and at some point the Saudis are going to have to do what the Americans did when the Americans had that kind of embarrassing evacuation from Saigon with helicopters dragging the last people off the roof clinging to the bottom of the helicopters.

None of the services returned until the fall of Al-Hazm city at the beginning of March, according to the director of the governorate\u2019s information department Yahya Qama'a.", "At various times during the month-long blackout in Al-Hazm, the mobile phone networks would briefly turn on and residents reported receiving calls from people they described as Houthi loyalists providing misleading updates about the unfolding clashes.", "\u201cThey spread rumors about the fall of key positions in Al-Jawf and the targeting of government leaders,\u201d Qama\u2019a said, noting that the disinformation contributed to the general sense of panic as tens of thousands of people fled the governorate.", "Others in Al-Hazm reported Houthi missile strikes when the mobile networks would briefly reconnect, insisting that the rebels use cell phone location technology to guide the missiles.", "\u201cWe were facing a militia with the capabilities of a state,\u201d he said.", "The telecom blackouts help explain why strategic towns and military positions the internationally recognized government and tribal allies had held since 2016 fell so quickly.", "Aside from the limited use of walkie talkies by some army units, anti-Houthi forces largely rely on the Sana\u2019a-based internet and phone infrastructure to communicate on the battlefield.

Doing so would undercut the ability of the army, tribes and civilians to organize and defend the city of 1.8 million.

Much of his time in Yemen is spent in Marib, overseeing the largest concentration of army troops in the country. With President Hadi rumored to be suffering from health problems, Ali Mohsen is thought to be playing the role of commander-in-chief overseeing battles in the northern governorates, once again fighting the Houthis.

However, such dire conditions have not stood in the way of young people across the country seeking to contribute to restoring and building peace in their war-torn country, as they play vital and positive roles in different sectors for the purpose of not only helping to voice people\u2019s hopes and de- sire to live in a stable and safe state, but also in cementing solid ground and the foundation for sustainable peace.", "Despite its major transformative potential, local level youth work is often overlooked by mainstream international discourses on national level peace processes and violent conflict.* This Brief sheds light on young peoples\u2019 activism before and during the war, the challenges they are currently facing, their visions for the future of Yemen and the kind of support they need. The contributions of young men and women to the economy, politics, culture and so- city, education, security and justice, and the environment show how youth are laying the groundwork for peace and social cohesion in their communities.", "From Introduction", "Youth activists are facing a wide range of seemingly insurmountable challenges \u2013 from a failing economy and a collapse in educational opportunities through to direct security threats and restrictions on their speech and movements. Even so, large numbers of youth across the country have sought out ways to positively contribute, particularly at community level, finding new spaces and new ways of working.", "Travel restrictions have forced activism to the local and community level, and the security situation has shifted the focus of youth to supporting humanitarian, health, environ- mental and social causes rather than overtly \u2018political\u2019 work.4 Youth initiatives are pro- viding public services amid collapsing state services and a lack of international development projects. The types of work that youth engage in vary significantly from one governorate to another, influenced by the level of direct conflict in their area, the attitudes and behaviors of the local de facto authorities, and the amount of support being received from the international community.", "Young men and women in rural and urban areas see their potential to positively contribute to peacebuilding across six areas specified above: the economy, politics, culture and society, security and justice, education and the environment. Many youth believe that small, community-level contributions are significant in themselves, as they contribute to building relationships and social cohesion in their communities; lay stepping stones to sustainable peace in the longer term; and reduce the cycle of violence by providing productive opportunities for young men and women outside of violence.", "https://carpo-bonn.org/portfolio/carpo-ypc-brief-17-the-role-of-youth-in-peacebuilding-in-yemen/", "cp1a Am wichtigsten: Coronavirus und Seuchen / Most important: Coronavirus and epidemics", "(* A H)", "B\u00fcrgerkriegsland Jemen meldet die ersten beiden Corona-Toten", "Der Jemen hat als letztes Land auf der Arabischen Halbinsel seiner ersten beiden Corona-Toten gemeldet.

Several changes have made the Corona pandemic an opportunity to reach a peace agreement in the country.

Those indicators include the following:", "Exploiting the Pandemic", "Local and international parties are taking advantage of the ceasefire and the Coronavirus to implement war-related plans or \"legitimacy of survival\" as follows:", "Secondly: The impact of Coronavirus on the public health system and humanitarian situation in Yemen", "From the perspective of the spread of the Corona epidemic in other countries, the virus is very dangerous. Yemen represents a refreshing environment for Coronavirus and there are many factors that may help in spreading out the pandemic with a high average of infections and deaths: a large population (approximately 30 million), a poor health care system, the years-long war that exhausted the population and made the situation the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, and the country's population has become very dependent and unable to live without assistance from outside. Almost 24.1 million depend on foreign assistance and other 14.3 million are in dire need of aid.[18] Millions are on the brink of starvation and hundreds of thousands of children suffer from malnutrition and acute malnutrition, which means that the natural immunity to Coronavirus is not sufficient in a war-torn country like Yemen.", "The country is already suffering from high levels of malnutrition and epidemic diseases such as cholera due to the ongoing war, which increased up to 132 percent last year, compared to 2018. More than 56,000 suspected cases were registered in the first seven weeks of 2020.[19] The number is likely to rise further during the rainy season in Yemen that started in April.[20]", "Yemen confirmed its first case of coronavirus on April 11, 2020 in Hadramawt, southeastern Yemen, the country's largest governorate. United Nations and relief officials believe that the virus is likely to have spread more widely, and that the increase of infections in Saudi Arabia reinforces these doubts.[21]", "It is difficult to know exactly about Coronavirus in Yemen because of the limited number of testing laboratories and people\u2019s fears of reporting. The virus is likely to spread among Yemenis before the authorities realize its existence in the country. The prevalence of the virus is possible due to poor living conditions, lack of personal protective equipment, population density, the difficulty in applying hygiene behaviors and the culture of social distancing in a society that sanctifies the social gatherings and people go to the khat markets every day, making the enforcement of containment measures so difficult.", "Obstacles to Coronavirus fight", "Countering Coronavirus:", "Third: The Economic Situation", "The country's economy collapsed during war, according to official estimates, and Yemen lost fifty billion dollars during the period (2015-2019).[32] The World Bank estimates that Yemen's GDP has shrunk by nearly 50% since 2014. In the first quarter of 2020, the economic predictions indicate that total economic conditions are likely to continue to deteriorate.[33]", "It is difficult for the authorities and researchers to estimate the size of the economic losses in light of the current situation of the conflict and the parallel \u201cwar economy\u201d activity, which seems to be a great driver of the economy in the country. But according to the study of epidemics in multiple times and regions, many areas will be critically affected.", "Food Security:", "The country has been in war for years and that has already affected food security as 80-90% of Yemen\u2019s needs depend on imports. The food security situation is worsening due to the lack of humanitarian access to people who are in urgent need of food assistance, as well as the lack of funding as some donors stopped funding.", "The crisis of Corona pandemic outbreak around the world will affect Yemen significantly for a long term due to the possible impact of Corona crisis on the supply chains and financial markets in other countries. Consequently, disturbances of external chains of supply beginning with wheat fields in Ukraine, and other places, can lead to a significant shortage of imports that will significantly affect \"food security\" in poor countries like Yemen.", "The high levels of sovereign debts will hinder the governments\u2019 ability to spend on stimulus plans that may help the economy during the next troublesome months and years", "Conclusion and Recommendations:", "1- In politics and war, Yemen does not only need a temporary truce, but also needs a complete cessation of war as long as Yemen faces a common threat of Corona that threatens all Yemenis. It is possible to begin with a temporary truce for several months to devote efforts to confront Corona and its expected catastrophic consequences. This step will only be achieved through concessions from the two parties of the war to reach a final formula that gives priority for health services and the economic development through forming joint specialized committees that manage these files. The priority in forming committees should be given to parliamentary committees and technical and logistical support offices to realize the purpose. All these committees and offices should be connected to a joint operations room with the supportive Gulf States and donor organizations, especially the United Nations.", "2- To reduce the health consequences:", "The two parties of conflict, in their control areas, should update the Infection Prevention Protocols, with regarding the commitment of the people to international virus prevention measures and strictly following them at all levels of health services, focusing mainly on emergency departments and outpatient clinics.
