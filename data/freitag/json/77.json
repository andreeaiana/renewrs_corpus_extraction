It has briefly surveyed the history of Southern Issue and the conflict relating to this issue, passing by 2015 war and shift of power. It has presented the history of this period impartially and neutrally and then reflected on the possible political scenarios in South Yemen in the light of the present war. It concluded with some recommendations that may help the concerned politicians involved in the Yemeni crisis to bring peace and stability to Southern Yemen particularly and Yemen generally.", "In the South, Southern Resistance Forces, led by General Aidroos AL-Zubaidi, are considered as the main player on the ground. These military forces were formed during the last two decades and most of them during the last 2015 war as they gained some financial and logistic military support from the Arab coalition and Hadi\u2019s legitimacy during their war against Huthi \u2013 Saleh\u2019 ally in 2015. Though these forces are fighting against Huthi \u2013 Saleh and give support to Arab coalition and Hadi\u2019s legitimacy in their war out of the Southern borders, they don\u2019t consider themselves a part of Hadi\u2019s legitimacy and don\u2019t believe in Hadi\u2019s political view to have Yemen of six regions. They consider themselves as the future military and security forces of the South. Before going on to explain more details, it will be better to have a look of the short back history of the failed Yemeni unification.", "Southern Issue", "Southern issue refers to southern people\u2019s political and economic suffering under the Northern regime. It began after taking over the South in 1994, deploying Northern military forces in its cities and mountains, excluding southern diplomats and army generals and soldiers from their works, distributing Southern land and wealth among northern leaders\u2026etc. Such a situation created a kind of unfairness against the Southern people and made them feeling that they were citizens of a second degree. Most of the Southerner could not express the discontent of the situation for some time due to the huge Yemeni military forces surrounding them but such a suffering was getting worse more and more and Southerners began their peaceful revolution by forming \u2018Military Pensioners\u2019 Association\u2019 and then \u2018Southern movement\u2019 in 2007 through which they demanded for equality with the northerner and returning to their work. This movement began as demanding for equality, financial rights, justice in distributing wealth and returning what has been robbed, which then developed into demanding for their political rights and restoration of their colonized state.", "The Rise of Southern Transitional Council (STC) as a Political Representative for Southerners", "Though the general goal of STC is totally different from Hadi's government\u2019s. The temporary alliance between STC and its resistance with Hadi's exiled government is only to emerge the Southern issue that was deliberately neglected to the surface and to be clearly seen in front of the neighbors and the world. It is worth mentioning that STC members are doing their best in building bridges of relationships on the locally, regionally and internationally sphere. In this respect, in logical activation, STC is systematically formed its branches in all the southern governorates and districts and continued in preparing security and military forces with the assistance of Arab coalition, especially UAE.", "Southern Issue and the Possible Scenarios in the South", "Based on researchers\u2019 observations of the situation in Southern Yemen and in Yemen generally, their meetings and discussions with some academicians and politicians and their reading and listening to speeches of political leaders and those specialists in Yemeni situation, they have summed up four possible scenarios that may take place in the South in the future. One scenario could be peaceful and satisfy the Southern will while the other three may complicate the situation and open new stages of war as they don\u2019t pay attention to the southern issue and to the power change that took place in the South.

My research on the Yemeni civil war suggests that these drone strikes can be partially explained by internal insecurities within the Houthi movement, as numerous Houthi officials have defected to Saudi Arabia in recent months. By targeting Saudi oil facilities, the Houthis can increase their popular support in northern Yemen. Houthi drone strikes play into the popular desire for revenge against Saudi Arabia\u2019s alleged theft of Yemen\u2019s oil wealth, showcase the Houthis\u2019 ability to counter Saudi bombardments, and counter Saudi depictions of the Houthis as a terrorist group that targets civilians. Houthi drone strikes against Saudi oil facilities are closely linked with the movement\u2019s outreach efforts in Yemen, as they appeal to the popular narrative that Saudi Arabia and its allies seized oil resources from the Yemeni people. Given this rhetoric and the absence of an international show of support for the Houthis, it is unsurprising that the Houthis used coercion to demonstrate that they were taking action against Saudi Arabia for its seizure of Yemen\u2019s oil.", "Houthi drone strikes against Saudi oil facilities are closely linked with the movement\u2019s outreach efforts in Yemen, as they appeal to the popular narrative that Saudi Arabia and its allies seized oil resources from the Yemeni people.", "Given this rhetoric and the absence of an international show of support for the Houthis, it is unsurprising that the Houthis used coercion to demonstrate that they were taking action against Saudi Arabia for its seizure of Yemen\u2019s oil.", "Houthi strikes on Saudi oil facilities also reveal how effective retaliation against perceived Saudi cease-fire violations is vital for the preservation of elite cohesion.", "Given this desire to dispel notions that the movement is weakening, Houthi drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities should be viewed as a direct retaliation for the refusal of Hadi-aligned military forces to withdraw from Hodeida.", "As Saudi policymakers frequently describe the Houthis as a terrorist group, the Houthis are seeking to counter that narrative by launching drone strikes against economic and military targets in Saudi Arabia, instead of civilian areas.", "My interviews with prominent Yemeni analysts reveal that the Houthis\u2019 reticence to target civilian areas in Saudi Arabia reflects their ambitions to preserve internal cohesion. Yemeni analyst Mareb al-Ward explained that the Houthis could fragment into \u201cideological factions\u201d that favored indefinite confrontation with Saudi Arabia and \u201cpragmatic factions\u201d that sought to pursue a peace settlement in Yemen.", "Although Houthi drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities cannot be completely separated from the broader escalation of tensions in the Persian Gulf region, it is inaccurate to say that the Houthis are merely acting as Iran\u2019s proxies when conducting these attacks.

Most of the Southerner could not express the discontent of the situation for some time due to the huge Yemeni military forces surrounding them but such a suffering was getting worse more and more and Southerners began their peaceful revolution by forming \u2018Military Pensioners\u2019 Association\u2019 and then \u2018Southern movement\u2019 in 2007 through which they demanded for equality with the northerner and returning to their work.

By targeting Saudi oil facilities, the Houthis can increase their popular support in northern Yemen. Houthi drone strikes play into the popular desire for revenge against Saudi Arabia\u2019s alleged theft of Yemen\u2019s oil wealth, showcase the Houthis\u2019 ability to counter Saudi bombardments, and counter Saudi depictions of the Houthis as a terrorist group that targets civilians.

One of these violations is attacks on schools.", "Reports of attacks on schools have risen dramatically since 2015, and UN assessments confirm over 2,000 schools are not fit for purpose due to physical damage caused by the conflict as well as the presence of armed groups.5 The UN has identified 95 attacks on schools between 2015 and 2017 6,7,8 which meet the evidence requirement to be classified as a grave violation. Three quarters of these have been carried out by the Saudi-led coalition.", "Where schools remain safe and undamaged, their operation is hampered by insufficient teachers, due to non-payment of salaries, and inadequate basic resources, including drinking water and latrines. War Child research, carried out in December 2018 across ten districts in Yemen, also highlighted that families are often concerned for the safety of children at, and on their way to schools. This often leads to parents keeping children at home. Even when at school, it is difficult for children to learn as they struggle to deal with the psychological impact of living through war and the effects of hunger and malnourishment.", "These factors are having a disproportionate impact on girls\u2019 access to education during the conflict, with the UN reporting that 36% of girls are currently out of school compared to 24% of boys.12 In many cases, families have de-prioritised girls\u2019 education as a reaction to economic hardship and greater fear for their safety.

Despite such obligations, attacks on schools in Yemen have continued unabated by many armed parties to the conflict and especially by the two main sides, the Houthi and Saudi-led coalition forces.", "The fact that education is under attack in Yemen is symptomatic of a wider pattern of flagrant disregard for international law throughout the conflict.", "Since 2015, 87 states have endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration16, a political commitment to protect children, teachers, schools and universities from attack and take measures to stop the military use of education facilities during conflict.

It concluded with some recommendations that may help the concerned politicians involved in the Yemeni crisis to bring peace and stability to Southern Yemen particularly and Yemen generally.", "In the South, Southern Resistance Forces, led by General Aidroos AL-Zubaidi, are considered as the main player on the ground. These military forces were formed during the last two decades and most of them during the last 2015 war as they gained some financial and logistic military support from the Arab coalition and Hadi\u2019s legitimacy during their war against Huthi \u2013 Saleh\u2019 ally in 2015. Though these forces are fighting against Huthi \u2013 Saleh and give support to Arab coalition and Hadi\u2019s legitimacy in their war out of the Southern borders, they don\u2019t consider themselves a part of Hadi\u2019s legitimacy and don\u2019t believe in Hadi\u2019s political view to have Yemen of six regions.

It began after taking over the South in 1994, deploying Northern military forces in its cities and mountains, excluding southern diplomats and army generals and soldiers from their works, distributing Southern land and wealth among northern leaders\u2026etc. Such a situation created a kind of unfairness against the Southern people and made them feeling that they were citizens of a second degree. Most of the Southerner could not express the discontent of the situation for some time due to the huge Yemeni military forces surrounding them but such a suffering was getting worse more and more and Southerners began their peaceful revolution by forming \u2018Military Pensioners\u2019 Association\u2019 and then \u2018Southern movement\u2019 in 2007 through which they demanded for equality with the northerner and returning to their work.

The temporary alliance between STC and its resistance with Hadi's exiled government is only to emerge the Southern issue that was deliberately neglected to the surface and to be clearly seen in front of the neighbors and the world. It is worth mentioning that STC members are doing their best in building bridges of relationships on the locally, regionally and internationally sphere.

My research on the Yemeni civil war suggests that these drone strikes can be partially explained by internal insecurities within the Houthi movement, as numerous Houthi officials have defected to Saudi Arabia in recent months. By targeting Saudi oil facilities, the Houthis can increase their popular support in northern Yemen. Houthi drone strikes play into the popular desire for revenge against Saudi Arabia\u2019s alleged theft of Yemen\u2019s oil wealth, showcase the Houthis\u2019 ability to counter Saudi bombardments, and counter Saudi depictions of the Houthis as a terrorist group that targets civilians. Houthi drone strikes against Saudi oil facilities are closely linked with the movement\u2019s outreach efforts in Yemen, as they appeal to the popular narrative that Saudi Arabia and its allies seized oil resources from the Yemeni people.

Worryingly, the number of children in need of assistance to access education has risen year on year, reaching 4.7 million by the end of 2018.3 The UN reports annually on the six grave violations4 of children\u2019s rights in Yemen, which have been committed by a number of parties to the conflict, including the Saudi-led coalition, the Houthis and other armed groups. One of these violations is attacks on schools.", "Reports of attacks on schools have risen dramatically since 2015, and UN assessments confirm over 2,000 schools are not fit for purpose due to physical damage caused by the conflict as well as the presence of armed groups.5 The UN has identified 95 attacks on schools between 2015 and 2017 6,7,8 which meet the evidence requirement to be classified as a grave violation. Three quarters of these have been carried out by the Saudi-led coalition.", "Where schools remain safe and undamaged, their operation is hampered by insufficient teachers, due to non-payment of salaries, and inadequate basic resources, including drinking water and latrines. War Child research, carried out in December 2018 across ten districts in Yemen, also highlighted that families are often concerned for the safety of children at, and on their way to schools. This often leads to parents keeping children at home. Even when at school, it is difficult for children to learn as they struggle to deal with the psychological impact of living through war and the effects of hunger and malnourishment.", "These factors are having a disproportionate impact on girls\u2019 access to education during the conflict, with the UN reporting that 36% of girls are currently out of school compared to 24% of boys.12 In many cases, families have de-prioritised girls\u2019 education as a reaction to economic hardship and greater fear for their safety. Child marriage figures have undergone a threefold increase between 2017 and 201", "Setbacks in children\u2019s education not only have consequences for the lives of individuals but also for the development and prosperity of the country. Damage to the education sector now will have longlasting consequences, impacting the education of future generations.", "Despite the urgency of need, UN Yemen humanitarian response plans have remained underfunded year on year, with the education cluster securing less than half (43%) of appeal amounts requested between 2011 and 2018.", "To ensure access to education, not only does funding need to increase, but it also requires parties to the conflict to uphold the legal and political obligations that exist on states to protect children\u2019s rights. Despite such obligations, attacks on schools in Yemen have continued unabated by many armed parties to the conflict and especially by the two main sides, the Houthi and Saudi-led coalition forces.", "The fact that education is under attack in Yemen is symptomatic of a wider pattern of flagrant disregard for international law throughout the conflict.", "Since 2015, 87 states have endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration16, a political commitment to protect children, teachers, schools and universities from attack and take measures to stop the military use of education facilities during conflict. The UK and France have made this commitment, but despite the clear evidence of attacks on schools by the Saudi-led coalition, they have continued to provide the coalition with political backing and military support through arms sales.", "These inconsistencies pose a threat to attempts to uphold the international rules-based system.

It concluded with some recommendations that may help the concerned politicians involved in the Yemeni crisis to bring peace and stability to Southern Yemen particularly and Yemen generally.", "In the South, Southern Resistance Forces, led by General Aidroos AL-Zubaidi, are considered as the main player on the ground. These military forces were formed during the last two decades and most of them during the last 2015 war as they gained some financial and logistic military support from the Arab coalition and Hadi\u2019s legitimacy during their war against Huthi \u2013 Saleh\u2019 ally in 2015. Though these forces are fighting against Huthi \u2013 Saleh and give support to Arab coalition and Hadi\u2019s legitimacy in their war out of the Southern borders, they don\u2019t consider themselves a part of Hadi\u2019s legitimacy and don\u2019t believe in Hadi\u2019s political view to have Yemen of six regions.

It began after taking over the South in 1994, deploying Northern military forces in its cities and mountains, excluding southern diplomats and army generals and soldiers from their works, distributing Southern land and wealth among northern leaders\u2026etc. Such a situation created a kind of unfairness against the Southern people and made them feeling that they were citizens of a second degree. Most of the Southerner could not express the discontent of the situation for some time due to the huge Yemeni military forces surrounding them but such a suffering was getting worse more and more and Southerners began their peaceful revolution by forming \u2018Military Pensioners\u2019 Association\u2019 and then \u2018Southern movement\u2019 in 2007 through which they demanded for equality with the northerner and returning to their work. This movement began as demanding for equality, financial rights, justice in distributing wealth and returning what has been robbed, which then developed into demanding for their political rights and restoration of their colonized state.", "The Rise of Southern Transitional Council (STC) as a Political Representative for Southerners", "Though the general goal of STC is totally different from Hadi's government\u2019s. The temporary alliance between STC and its resistance with Hadi's exiled government is only to emerge the Southern issue that was deliberately neglected to the surface and to be clearly seen in front of the neighbors and the world. It is worth mentioning that STC members are doing their best in building bridges of relationships on the locally, regionally and internationally sphere. In this respect, in logical activation, STC is systematically formed its branches in all the southern governorates and districts and continued in preparing security and military forces with the assistance of Arab coalition, especially UAE.", "Southern Issue and the Possible Scenarios in the South", "Based on researchers\u2019 observations of the situation in Southern Yemen and in Yemen generally, their meetings and discussions with some academicians and politicians and their reading and listening to speeches of political leaders and those specialists in Yemeni situation, they have summed up four possible scenarios that may take place in the South in the future.

My research on the Yemeni civil war suggests that these drone strikes can be partially explained by internal insecurities within the Houthi movement, as numerous Houthi officials have defected to Saudi Arabia in recent months. By targeting Saudi oil facilities, the Houthis can increase their popular support in northern Yemen. Houthi drone strikes play into the popular desire for revenge against Saudi Arabia\u2019s alleged theft of Yemen\u2019s oil wealth, showcase the Houthis\u2019 ability to counter Saudi bombardments, and counter Saudi depictions of the Houthis as a terrorist group that targets civilians. Houthi drone strikes against Saudi oil facilities are closely linked with the movement\u2019s outreach efforts in Yemen, as they appeal to the popular narrative that Saudi Arabia and its allies seized oil resources from the Yemeni people. Given this rhetoric and the absence of an international show of support for the Houthis, it is unsurprising that the Houthis used coercion to demonstrate that they were taking action against Saudi Arabia for its seizure of Yemen\u2019s oil.", "Houthi drone strikes against Saudi oil facilities are closely linked with the movement\u2019s outreach efforts in Yemen, as they appeal to the popular narrative that Saudi Arabia and its allies seized oil resources from the Yemeni people.", "Given this rhetoric and the absence of an international show of support for the Houthis, it is unsurprising that the Houthis used coercion to demonstrate that they were taking action against Saudi Arabia for its seizure of Yemen\u2019s oil.", "Houthi strikes on Saudi oil facilities also reveal how effective retaliation against perceived Saudi cease-fire violations is vital for the preservation of elite cohesion.", "Given this desire to dispel notions that the movement is weakening, Houthi drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities should be viewed as a direct retaliation for the refusal of Hadi-aligned military forces to withdraw from Hodeida.", "As Saudi policymakers frequently describe the Houthis as a terrorist group, the Houthis are seeking to counter that narrative by launching drone strikes against economic and military targets in Saudi Arabia, instead of civilian areas.", "My interviews with prominent Yemeni analysts reveal that the Houthis\u2019 reticence to target civilian areas in Saudi Arabia reflects their ambitions to preserve internal cohesion.
