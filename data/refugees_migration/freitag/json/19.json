This has often led to the view in many Western Nations, where political realities complicate the situation, that further intervention is viewed as necessary to prevent an even greater harm. Meanwhile, defense industries continue to exert enormous influence on policy makers in all of these nations, and the lack of a cohesive foreign policy by the United States and the United Kingdom have resulted in a lack of political will to extract forces from the region.", "In this geopolitical context, the Yemeni Civil War is unlikely to end in the near future, with the Arabian Peninsula unlikely to see stability as long as the war pervades. One question that remains at the forefront of the violence in Yemen is whether and how civilian victims of the violence in Yemen may seek justice for the crimes perpetrated against them. Importantly, crimes against Yemeni citizens did not begin with airstrikes or indiscriminate uses of artillery. Rather, the crimes began when weapons, guidance systems, and intelligence were sold, gifted, and traded to perpetrators of the atrocities seen in Yemen today. This wider perspective on criminality in Yemen implicates those who assisted, aided, and abetted heinous acts against Yemeni civilians.

The US provided aircraft and bombs. Serviced the planes. Provided intelligence for targeting. And initially refueled Saudi aircraft as well. Alas, it turns out that the Saudis pilots were good at little more than bombing weddings, funerals, school buses, apartments, and other civilian targets, killing thousands of Yemenis.", "Perhaps the most ironic impact of the coalition\u2019s aggressive war was to make the Houthis dependent on Iran.", "Although the Houthis became the only viable option for Tehran, the movement has retained its independence.

In recent months, following the Houthi occupation of the capital city of Sana\u2018a inSeptember 2014, the group has expanded their area of control into the south of Yemen. The Houthis have solidified their position in power by forming a coalition government with other Yemeni tribal and political groups. They are gaining control over more territory as the most powerful political force in Yemen. Since the initial conflict between the Houthis and the government of Yemen began in earnest in 2004, the Houthis have transitioned from a peaceful social movement to a violent anti-government movement, to a movement holding national political power and seeking to create a coalition government in Yemen (Dumm 2). With the flight of Yemeni President Hadi from thecapital Sana\u2018a and the recent campaign of Saudi anti-Houthi airstrikes with the stated aim of restoring Hadi to power, an understanding of the Houthi Islamic social movement is more important than ever. An examination of the Houthis as an Islamic social movement provides a framework that can be used to effectively explore the identity, beliefs, and background of the group. Applying social movement theory literature and historical analysis gives one the opportunity to examine the roots of the Houthi movement and the historical factors that led to the group\u2018s creation and popularity.

The reality of today\u2019s Ansar Allah is both a skilled paramilitary force that has internalized the lessons of a decade and a half of war, as well as a political organization with the veneer of a social justice movement, which excels in the production of propaganda on the local and regional stages.
