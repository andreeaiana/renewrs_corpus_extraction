Qatar, the UN, EU, US, and the Gulf Cooperation Council have tried to mediate the conflict between the Government of Yemen and the Houthis. But mediation efforts have been complicated by the duality of roles: some mediators have been directly involved as a conflict party, and others indirectly involved, providing support to those engaged in the war. These factors violate the mediation principle of impartiality and diminish a mediator\u2019s credibility and leverage. In this brief, we analyze all mediation efforts between the Yemeni government and the Houthis since 2007, reviewing the strategies, outcomes, and implementation processes to identify the factors that have hindered successful mediation.", "Our analysis is the first that overviews mediation throughout the entire GoY-Houthi conflict by including pre-2011 events. For our research, we reviewed 37 studies on mediation in Yemen, coded mediation actors, strategies, outcomes, and implementation. We identify three different phases of mediation in the GoY-Houthi conflict.", "The first period (2004\u20132009) entailed the six round Saada wars. These conflicts were localized clashes waged in the original stronghold of the Houthis in the northern governorates of the country. Qatar was the only mediator in this period.", "The second phase (2011\u20132015) began with the Yemeni episode of the Arab Spring and ended with the Saudi Arabia-led intervention in March 2015. This period did not centre on the GoY-Houthi-conflict exclusively, but aimed to negotiate a peaceful transition of power from former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and to establish a unity government. Three mediators were involved in the second phase: The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the UN, and the EU. All these actors participated in negotiating the power transition, but the overall framework was set by the GCC Initiative of 2011.", "The third and current phase of the conflict (since 2015) marks the internationalization and the fragmentation of the conflict, mediated by the UN. Table 1 summarizes mediation efforts in the GoY-Houthi conflict from 2007 to 2018.", "There is an urgent need to implement the provisions of the Stockholm Agreement. But mediators need to recognize and address the fractured nature of the Yemeni Civil War. Even if the GoY-Houthi conflict is resolved, the international community will have to find a comprehensive resolution to the myriad of conflicts between armed non-state actors, especially in the South and in the Sunni tribal territories. In addition, since 2011, women have been largely absent from peace negotiations.", "Mediators also should recognize that UN Resolution 2216 is not a viable framework for negotiations. Since 2015, the Houthis have not only occupied territories, but also consolidated their gains, and, as such, any peace initiative based on UN SCR 2216 would be considered as a setback from a Houthi perspective.", "Moreover, in January 2018, violence erupted in Aden between Hadi\u2019s troops and the Southern Transitional Council, which, prior to this conflict, had been on the same side in principle.

But mediation efforts have been complicated by the duality of roles: some mediators have been directly involved as a conflict party, and others indirectly involved, providing support to those engaged in the war. These factors violate the mediation principle of impartiality and diminish a mediator\u2019s credibility and leverage. In this brief, we analyze all mediation efforts between the Yemeni government and the Houthis since 2007, reviewing the strategies, outcomes, and implementation processes to identify the factors that have hindered successful mediation.", "Our analysis is the first that overviews mediation throughout the entire GoY-Houthi conflict by including pre-2011 events. For our research, we reviewed 37 studies on mediation in Yemen, coded mediation actors, strategies, outcomes, and implementation. We identify three different phases of mediation in the GoY-Houthi conflict.", "The first period (2004\u20132009) entailed the six round Saada wars. These conflicts were localized clashes waged in the original stronghold of the Houthis in the northern governorates of the country. Qatar was the only mediator in this period.", "The second phase (2011\u20132015) began with the Yemeni episode of the Arab Spring and ended with the Saudi Arabia-led intervention in March 2015. This period did not centre on the GoY-Houthi-conflict exclusively, but aimed to negotiate a peaceful transition of power from former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and to establish a unity government. Three mediators were involved in the second phase: The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the UN, and the EU. All these actors participated in negotiating the power transition, but the overall framework was set by the GCC Initiative of 2011.", "The third and current phase of the conflict (since 2015) marks the internationalization and the fragmentation of the conflict, mediated by the UN. Table 1 summarizes mediation efforts in the GoY-Houthi conflict from 2007 to 2018.", "There is an urgent need to implement the provisions of the Stockholm Agreement. But mediators need to recognize and address the fractured nature of the Yemeni Civil War. Even if the GoY-Houthi conflict is resolved, the international community will have to find a comprehensive resolution to the myriad of conflicts between armed non-state actors, especially in the South and in the Sunni tribal territories. In addition, since 2011, women have been largely absent from peace negotiations.", "Mediators also should recognize that UN Resolution 2216 is not a viable framework for negotiations. Since 2015, the Houthis have not only occupied territories, but also consolidated their gains, and, as such, any peace initiative based on UN SCR 2216 would be considered as a setback from a Houthi perspective.", "Moreover, in January 2018, violence erupted in Aden between Hadi\u2019s troops and the Southern Transitional Council, which, prior to this conflict, had been on the same side in principle.
