Danach soll die Sicherheit der Region einzig Angelegenheit der Anrainer- und Regionalstaaten sein, ausl\u00e4ndische Truppen sollen aus der Region abziehen, ein permanenter Dialog und vertrauensbildende Ma\u00dfnahmen sollen den Iran und die arabischen Golfstaaten zusammenbringen. Vereinbarungen \u00fcber den Kampf gegen den Terror, L\u00f6sung der Kriege im Jemen und Syrien und Bildung einer Zone frei von Massenvernichtungswaffen werden angestrebt. Langfristiges Ziel ist demnach die Bildung einer \u201cOrganisation f\u00fcr Sicherheit und Kooperation am Persischen Golf\u201d, der der Iran und die arabischen Golfstaaten angeh\u00f6ren sollen. Russland, China, die USA, die EU, Indien und weitere interessierte Staaten sollen einen Beobachterstatus erhalten.

September sprechen, drei Tage vor dem Beginn der diesj\u00e4hrigen UN-Vollversammlung.

The STC has retreated from its takeover of Yemeni government institutions and issued statements confirming its acceptance of Yemen\u2019s legitimacy as enshrined by the United Nations. Indeed, the STC reassured the Saudis, relieved the UAE of great embarrassment and, more importantly, saved itself and its people, the citizens of the South, and the entire region from more bloodshed.  But the debate, of course, will not stop. I have read articles by Dr. Mohammed al-Rumaihi and Dr. Saad al-Ajmi on the dispute. In short, they believe that the independence of southern Yemen is the best solution. Even educated Saudis believe that the Saudi interest is to carve out two or three Yemeni states, and not one united Yemen.  This is especially true since the experience of dealing with a unified Yemen ruled by the regime of the late president Ali Abdullah Saleh was difficult and harmful for Saudi Arabia. But it is dangerous to tamper with the political entities of states.
