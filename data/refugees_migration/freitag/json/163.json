After five years, the coalition has not been able to, and probably will never, defeat the Houthis.Given the available information on the ongoing war's main events, one can assess why the Arab coalition cannot, at least, defeat the Yemeni Houthis, and sometimes incurs itself a defeat.This can be attributed to reasons concerning the parties to the conflict.

This leads to grave losses when being ambushed, unable to fend off attacks by drones, etc.Ansar Allah, however, are different in terms of ordnance, even with supplies from third countries they cannot radically change the situation.

After five years, the coalition has not been able to, and probably will never, defeat the Houthis.Given the available information on the ongoing war's main events, one can assess why the Arab coalition cannot, at least, defeat the Yemeni Houthis, and sometimes incurs itself a defeat.This can be attributed to reasons concerning the parties to the conflict. While the coalition armies' force depends on foreign modern ordnance and support from advanced countries, weapons do not always respond to current challenges, and their operators may not boast their skills in using them. This leads to grave losses when being ambushed, unable to fend off attacks by drones, etc.Ansar Allah, however, are different in terms of ordnance, even with supplies from third countries they cannot radically change the situation. At the same time, the Houthis know the region well and are supported by local communities. They also learn fast, take in consideration the enemy's errors and actively use military advisors.

The current escalation is threatening to destroy the progress Marib has made even during the difficulties of the past half-decade.", "After the war started in 2014, Marib\u2019s relative stability and its strong local leadership drastically changed the governorate, allowing a once underdeveloped region to become prosperous.", "Today, there are more paved roads in Marib than ever before, and basic services have improved dramatically as the local economy has flourished. These improvements happened due to the political decentralization that occurred through the conflict: the capital was controlled by the Houthis and the alternative capital of Aden\u2014currently home to the internationally recognized government\u2014was unable to provide the stability needed for a state to have authority.", "Now, ironically, the closest resemblance to a state is in Marib because of its strong rule of law and internal security. As such, Marib has become host to hundreds of thousands of those who fled the war zones from all over the country. Marib has also served as a center for restructuring the national army in collaboration with the regional states and the international community to put an end to the Houthi coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.", "Not only has Marib developed structurally, but there have also been significant improvements from a human rights perspective. I personally have seen the local community in Marib change, especially regarding its attitude towards women. In 2010, I had founded a civil society organization we called Marib Girls Foundation to empower women in Marib, but because the local environment at the time was not supportive of our work and the community was not ready to see women working in civil society, we had to shut the organization down.
