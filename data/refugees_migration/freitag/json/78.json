Local structures of authority have emerged, along with a plethora of para-state agents and militias at the behest of local elites and international patrons. According to the UN Panel of Experts, despite the disappearance of central authority, \u201cYemen, as a State, has all but ceased to exist,\u201d replaced by distinct statelets fighting against each other (UN Panel of Experts, 26 January 2018).", "This is the second report of a three-part analysis series exploring the fragmentation of state authority in Southern Yemen, where a secessionist body \u2013 the Southern Transitional Council (STC) \u2013 has established itself, not without contestation, as the \u201clegitimate representative\u201d of the Southern people (Southern Transitional Council, 7 December 2018). Since its emergence in 2017, the STC has evolved into a state-like entity with an executive body (the Leadership Council), a legislature (the Southern National Assembly), and armed forces, although the latter are under the virtual command structure of the Interior Ministry in the internationally-recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Investigating conflict dynamics in seven southern governorates, these reports seek to highlight how Southern Yemen is all but a monolithic unit, reflecting the divided loyalties and aspirations of its political communities.", "This second report focuses on the Arabian Sea island of Socotra and the easternmost region of Mahrah. Previously forming the Mahrah Sultanate of Ghaydah and Socotra, they hold a special place in Yemeni dynamics in that they are the only two governorates that have not been directly affected by the violence of the current conflict. They have, however, been impacted by conflict-related tensions, which are primarily the result of interventionist policies from Saudi-led coalition states, upsetting otherwise peaceful tribal orders.", "Unlike the rest of Yemen, which has been directly impacted by the violence of the attempted Houthi takeover and the subsequent Saudi-led coalition intervention, these two isolated governorates have remained far from the frontlines since 2014. Yet, at times, they have made international headlines as a result of foreign interventionism and the subsequent local responses. In the first international reporting from Socotra after the war, British newspaper The Independent argued in May 2018 that \u201cSocotra is finally dragged into Yemen\u2019s civil war,\u201d a week after it had reported that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had \u201cannexed this sovereign piece of Yemen\u201d (The Independent, 2 May 2018).

Given chronically poor access to education in Yemen, the majority of these have been unskilled or semi-skilled laborers. The proximity of Saudi Arabia and the robustness of its oil-driven economy has made it a natural destination for most of Yemen\u2019s expatriate labor force. The economic boom in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states in the 1970s and 1980s, with the corresponding demand for labor, also drew many Yemenis to work in the GCC, with Saudi Arabia opening its borders to Yemenis without visa requirements.", "Following the 1990 Gulf War \u2013 and the Yemeni government\u2019s decision not to support the United Nations Security Council resolutions against Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait \u2013 Yemeni workers were forcibly deported en masse from GCC countries. Close to one million returned home from Saudi Arabia alone. The loss of remittances from these workers, along with the increased demands on public services and pressure on the labor market, caused rapid economic decline and social instability in Yemen. This in turn is regarded as a contributing factor to the country\u2019s 1994 civil war and today\u2019s economic crisis.", "In 1990 Riyadh also initiated a program to increase the share of its nationals in the labor force, however, it was not implemented at the time. Thus, over the subsequent two decades the number of Yemenis working in the kingdom returned to pre-1990 levels. Following the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings around the region and in Yemen, GCC monarchies\u2019 security fears increased, as did their desire to increase employment for their nationals. Thus, in 2011 Saudi Arabia\u2019s campaign to nationalize its labor market was reactivated, with this becoming part of Riyadh\u2019s larger Vision 2030 economic plan in 2013.", "The impact of these policies has become more pronounced in recent years, with greater restrictions on the number of job categories open to expatriate workers, fees to live and work in Saudi Arabia increasing for legally documented workers and their families, and undocumented laborers facing an evermore precarious existence and exploitation. This, along with Saudi campaigns to arrest and forcibly expel illegal workers, has resulted in tens of thousands of Yemenis being forced to return to their home country.", "The escalation of this conflict has caused widespread economic collapse in Yemen, mass loss of livelihood and the cessation of large-scale oil exports, previously the country\u2019s largest source of foreign currency. The result is that the survival of millions of Yemenis has become dependent on remittances sent home from relatives working Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere. These remittances \u2013 totalling billions of dollars annually \u2013 have also become the primary supply of foreign currency in the local market and critical to facilitating imports of basic commodities. Thus, remittances from Yemen\u2019s expatriate workforce have prevented their country\u2019s food security crisis, already the largest in the world, from being profoundly worse.", "Should the mass expulsion of expatriate workers currently underway in Saudi Arabia continue at pace, it will have another catastrophic economic and humanitarian consequences for Yemenis. This in turn would spur further socioeconomic and political instability across Yemen and create an environment conducive to long-term armed conflict, regardless of whether a political settlement is reached between the parties currently at war. As many observers see Yemen\u2019s stability as a cornerstone of stability in the wider Arabian Peninsula, the ramifications would be regionalized, if not globalized. Thus beyond the moral obligation to prevent the intensifying of mass human suffering, it is in the self-interest of all local, regional and international stakeholders that the flow of remittances from Yemen\u2019s expatriate workforce be maintained.", "It is incumbent on GCC states, and Saudi Arabia in particular, to allow Yemeni expat workers an exemption from the current labor nationalization campaigns, at least in the mid-term.", "http://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/7471?fbclid=IwAR1wrv8pN-oXZrcPpAdSFDhI7G2qeVSLESNFeribm6dAN3B4MZs2aEaRgM4", "(** B P)", "America\u2019s persecution of Julian Assange has everything to do with Yemen", "The US feels enraged by any revelation of what it really knows, by any alternative source of information.

In the process, National Security Adviser John Bolton treated us all to a new phrase, no less laughable than Bush the younger\u2019s 2002 \u201caxis of evil\u201d (Iran, Iraq, and North Korea). He labeled Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua a \u201ctroika of tyranny.\u201d", "Alliteration, no less!

I\u2019m thinking about the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the military junta in Egypt, and the colonizing state of Israel\u2014all countries that eschew real democracy and are working together to rain chaos on an already unstable region.", "If you weren\u2019t an American, this might already be clear to you.

Two of those countries\u2014Israel and Saudi Arabia\u2014desperately desire that the American military take on their Iranian nemesis. The third, Egypt, will go along with just about anything as long as Uncle Sam keeps the military aid flowing to Cairo. Think of it as potentially the ultimate \u201cwag the dog\u201d scenario, with Washington taking on the role of the dog. \u2013 by Danny Sjursen", "http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/176569/tomgram%3A_danny_sjursen%2C_with_friends_like_these.../ = https://www.thenation.com/article/americas-allies-in-the-middle-east-saudi-arabia-israel-egypt-the-real-troika-of-tyranny/ = https://consortiumnews.com/2019/05/31/john-boltons-absurd-troika-tyranny/", "(* B K P)", "US-Vizepr\u00e4sident Pence schw\u00f6rt zuk\u00fcnftige Soldaten auf Krieg mit Russland ein (Video)", "US-Vizepr\u00e4sident Mike Pence hat in einer Rede vor einer Klasse der US-Milit\u00e4rakademie Westpoint die \"Unausweichlichkeit\" kommender Kriege bekr\u00e4ftigt.

According to the UN Panel of Experts, despite the disappearance of central authority, \u201cYemen, as a State, has all but ceased to exist,\u201d replaced by distinct statelets fighting against each other (UN Panel of Experts, 26 January 2018).", "This is the second report of a three-part analysis series exploring the fragmentation of state authority in Southern Yemen, where a secessionist body \u2013 the Southern Transitional Council (STC) \u2013 has established itself, not without contestation, as the \u201clegitimate representative\u201d of the Southern people (Southern Transitional Council, 7 December 2018). Since its emergence in 2017, the STC has evolved into a state-like entity with an executive body (the Leadership Council), a legislature (the Southern National Assembly), and armed forces, although the latter are under the virtual command structure of the Interior Ministry in the internationally-recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Investigating conflict dynamics in seven southern governorates, these reports seek to highlight how Southern Yemen is all but a monolithic unit, reflecting the divided loyalties and aspirations of its political communities.", "This second report focuses on the Arabian Sea island of Socotra and the easternmost region of Mahrah.

They have, however, been impacted by conflict-related tensions, which are primarily the result of interventionist policies from Saudi-led coalition states, upsetting otherwise peaceful tribal orders.", "Unlike the rest of Yemen, which has been directly impacted by the violence of the attempted Houthi takeover and the subsequent Saudi-led coalition intervention, these two isolated governorates have remained far from the frontlines since 2014. Yet, at times, they have made international headlines as a result of foreign interventionism and the subsequent local responses. In the first international reporting from Socotra after the war, British newspaper The Independent argued in May 2018 that \u201cSocotra is finally dragged into Yemen\u2019s civil war,\u201d a week after it had reported that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had \u201cannexed this sovereign piece of Yemen\u201d (The Independent, 2 May 2018).

Given chronically poor access to education in Yemen, the majority of these have been unskilled or semi-skilled laborers. The proximity of Saudi Arabia and the robustness of its oil-driven economy has made it a natural destination for most of Yemen\u2019s expatriate labor force. The economic boom in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states in the 1970s and 1980s, with the corresponding demand for labor, also drew many Yemenis to work in the GCC, with Saudi Arabia opening its borders to Yemenis without visa requirements.", "Following the 1990 Gulf War \u2013 and the Yemeni government\u2019s decision not to support the United Nations Security Council resolutions against Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait \u2013 Yemeni workers were forcibly deported en masse from GCC countries. Close to one million returned home from Saudi Arabia alone. The loss of remittances from these workers, along with the increased demands on public services and pressure on the labor market, caused rapid economic decline and social instability in Yemen. This in turn is regarded as a contributing factor to the country\u2019s 1994 civil war and today\u2019s economic crisis.", "In 1990 Riyadh also initiated a program to increase the share of its nationals in the labor force, however, it was not implemented at the time. Thus, over the subsequent two decades the number of Yemenis working in the kingdom returned to pre-1990 levels. Following the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings around the region and in Yemen, GCC monarchies\u2019 security fears increased, as did their desire to increase employment for their nationals. Thus, in 2011 Saudi Arabia\u2019s campaign to nationalize its labor market was reactivated, with this becoming part of Riyadh\u2019s larger Vision 2030 economic plan in 2013.", "The impact of these policies has become more pronounced in recent years, with greater restrictions on the number of job categories open to expatriate workers, fees to live and work in Saudi Arabia increasing for legally documented workers and their families, and undocumented laborers facing an evermore precarious existence and exploitation. This, along with Saudi campaigns to arrest and forcibly expel illegal workers, has resulted in tens of thousands of Yemenis being forced to return to their home country.", "The escalation of this conflict has caused widespread economic collapse in Yemen, mass loss of livelihood and the cessation of large-scale oil exports, previously the country\u2019s largest source of foreign currency. The result is that the survival of millions of Yemenis has become dependent on remittances sent home from relatives working Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere. These remittances \u2013 totalling billions of dollars annually \u2013 have also become the primary supply of foreign currency in the local market and critical to facilitating imports of basic commodities. Thus, remittances from Yemen\u2019s expatriate workforce have prevented their country\u2019s food security crisis, already the largest in the world, from being profoundly worse.", "Should the mass expulsion of expatriate workers currently underway in Saudi Arabia continue at pace, it will have another catastrophic economic and humanitarian consequences for Yemenis. This in turn would spur further socioeconomic and political instability across Yemen and create an environment conducive to long-term armed conflict, regardless of whether a political settlement is reached between the parties currently at war. As many observers see Yemen\u2019s stability as a cornerstone of stability in the wider Arabian Peninsula, the ramifications would be regionalized, if not globalized. Thus beyond the moral obligation to prevent the intensifying of mass human suffering, it is in the self-interest of all local, regional and international stakeholders that the flow of remittances from Yemen\u2019s expatriate workforce be maintained.", "It is incumbent on GCC states, and Saudi Arabia in particular, to allow Yemeni expat workers an exemption from the current labor nationalization campaigns, at least in the mid-term.", "http://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/7471?fbclid=IwAR1wrv8pN-oXZrcPpAdSFDhI7G2qeVSLESNFeribm6dAN3B4MZs2aEaRgM4", "(** B P)", "America\u2019s persecution of Julian Assange has everything to do with Yemen", "The US feels enraged by any revelation of what it really knows, by any alternative source of information.

In the process, National Security Adviser John Bolton treated us all to a new phrase, no less laughable than Bush the younger\u2019s 2002 \u201caxis of evil\u201d (Iran, Iraq, and North Korea). He labeled Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua a \u201ctroika of tyranny.\u201d", "Alliteration, no less!

I\u2019m thinking about the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the military junta in Egypt, and the colonizing state of Israel\u2014all countries that eschew real democracy and are working together to rain chaos on an already unstable region.", "If you weren\u2019t an American, this might already be clear to you.

Two of those countries\u2014Israel and Saudi Arabia\u2014desperately desire that the American military take on their Iranian nemesis. The third, Egypt, will go along with just about anything as long as Uncle Sam keeps the military aid flowing to Cairo. Think of it as potentially the ultimate \u201cwag the dog\u201d scenario, with Washington taking on the role of the dog. \u2013 by Danny Sjursen", "http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/176569/tomgram%3A_danny_sjursen%2C_with_friends_like_these.../ = https://www.thenation.com/article/americas-allies-in-the-middle-east-saudi-arabia-israel-egypt-the-real-troika-of-tyranny/ = https://consortiumnews.com/2019/05/31/john-boltons-absurd-troika-tyranny/", "(* B K P)", "US-Vizepr\u00e4sident Pence schw\u00f6rt zuk\u00fcnftige Soldaten auf Krieg mit Russland ein (Video)", "US-Vizepr\u00e4sident Mike Pence hat in einer Rede vor einer Klasse der US-Milit\u00e4rakademie Westpoint die \"Unausweichlichkeit\" kommender Kriege bekr\u00e4ftigt.
