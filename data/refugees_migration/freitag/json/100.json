And more curious yet, that vast global infrastructure, that \u201cempire of bases\u201d (in Chalmers Johnson\u2019s eloquent phrase), is hardly noticed in what, since 9/11, has been known as \u201cthe homeland.\u201d Few here think much about those global garrisons (although hundreds of thousands of Americans have in recent years been deployed to them); the media that cover every presidential tweet as if it were a missive from the emperor almost never mention them, much less report on them; and no one -- Turse and a few scholars aside -- seems to have the slightest interest in counting them up, much less considering their cost or even the global role they\u2019ve been playing all these years. In domestic terms, they are essentially missing in action, which means a vision of how the United States has positioned itself on this planet is missing in action as well.", "With that in mind, let\u2019s acknowledge something else in this strange moment of ours: while that massive (and massively expensive) base structure remains firmly in place, American imperial power is increasingly another matter.", "Bases, Bases, Everywhere...
