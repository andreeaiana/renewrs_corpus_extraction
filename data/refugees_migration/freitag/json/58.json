More than 1.2 million public sector workers \u2014 and their families \u2014 were affected by the suspension of government salaries in September 2016.[3] Unemployment and underemployment, as well as salary suspensions and the depreciation of the Yemeni rial, have dragged the middle class toward or into poverty and those already in poverty into destitution. While payments to some public sector workers have resumed, some 20 million of Yemen\u2019s 28 million people continue to face severe or acute food insecurity.[4]", "Focus group discussion participants and key informants perceived women and men as having navigated the country\u2019s new economic reality differently. Many said women were generally proactive and creative in seeking paid work, while some men were reluctant to work in jobs they considered unsuitable or were pressured \u2013 economically and by traditional definitions of masculinity \u2014 into joining fighting forces to support their families.", "Some participants and key informants in all areas noted more positive male attitudes emerging during the war toward women working, saying, for example, that men increasingly seek brides who are employed in contrast to a pre-war tendency toward seeking a housewife. Indications were more mixed, however, as to whether women\u2019s economic empowerment was expanding their influence in family decision-making or would last beyond the conflict \u2013 indicating an area where post-war support could be critical.", "In exploring the gendered consequences of the conflict on Yemen\u2019s youth, this report finds that the prospects of a generation of Yemeni boys and girls as well as young adults have been compromised by the conflict-driven devastation of education. War-related economic and security factors are magnifying the societal problem of early marriage, especially among girls, and are driving boys out of school and into the ranks of fighting forces.", "Prior to the conflict, poverty and lack of access to schools in rural areas had limited families\u2019 abilities to educate their children, and war has only compounded this problem. Yemenis report having to choose between feeding or educating their children, being unable to afford transport costs or school needs such as uniforms and books. With teachers unpaid or the value of their salaries depreciated by rampant inflation, many lack motivation, are preoccupied with securing extra outside income or have joined frontlines. Stress due to the war and economic collapse has affected teachers\u2019 behavior toward students, and students report to class hungry and displaying symptoms of trauma.", "War is also magnifying existing gender and power inequalities that lie at the root of gender-based violence (GBV).

It also looks closely at the gendered experience of the war on Yemen\u2019s youths \u2013 boys and girls as well as young adults \u2013 and on the nature and, as much as possible within the limitations of the study, the extent of physical and sexual violence at home and in the community.", "The following emerged as the key perceptions of focus group participants and key informants:", "Women have shown resilience to economic challenges, displaying flexibility and innovation as they are pushed into seeking paid work. Women are starting businesses at home, online and in the community, and working in nontraditional sectors. Opportunities available to illiterate and uneducated women often have been precarious and low-paid.", "Attitudes appear to be changing toward women working. Yet, the sustainability of their increased economic empowerment is uncertain. Shifts in household gender roles have been limited. Women\u2019s economic empowerment often was associated with a diminution of men\u2019s status.", "Lack of income has undermined men\u2019s traditional role as breadwinner and has affected family life. Men have moved to jobs of lower social status than their previous roles and have been driven to frontlines seeking a salary. Pressure to conform to masculine norms also has influenced the decision to fight.", "Children are dropping out of school. Rising poverty has left parents unable to afford to educate their children. Girls are more likely to be withdrawn from school than boys, for cultural, economic and security reasons.
