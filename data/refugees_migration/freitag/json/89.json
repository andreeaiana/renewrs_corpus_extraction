Islah officially supports the internationally recognized Yemeni government of President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi; however, the party\u2019s increasing capacity to act independently in Taiz represents a further erosion of the state\u2019s purview within areas the government supposedly controls. Islah\u2019s rise in Taiz, if solidified, is likely to complicate United Nations-led efforts to secure a peace agreement between the Houthi leadership and the internationally recognized Yemeni government. It also threatens potential post-conflict efforts to stabilize the country\u2019s political and security environments and establish effective state sovereignty.", "With the escalation of the ongoing conflict in March 2015, Taiz City and the wider governorate have been an epicenter of violence, with Houthi fighters continually clashing with various anti-Houthi forces. Within the anti-Houthi coalition in Taiz City, Islah-affiliated forces and the Salafi-oriented Abu al-Abbas Brigades have also had long-running tensions and periodic clashes.

Following this, Hadi announced the creation of a presidential committee to end the violence. The presidential committee, however, was dominated by Islah figures. Most prominent among these, and the committee chair is Abdu Farhan Salem, commonly referred to as \u201cSalem.\u201d He is arguably the most important Islah-affiliated military official in Taiz, as an advisor to the commander of the Taiz Military Axis, Khaled Fadl \u2013 also an Islah figure.", "The presidential committee brokered a deal in which both the Abu al-Abbas Brigades and Islah-affiliated national army units and militias agreed to withdraw from positions within Taiz City. On August 18, the committee reported that all positions had been handed over to the Presidential Guard. However, by month\u2019s end it was clear that while Abu al-Abbas\u2019 forces had withdrawn, Islah-affiliated forces remained.", "In September, Governor Mahmoud publicly thanked the presidential committee for its efforts before asking that it be dissolved, having seemingly fulfilled its mandate. The committee refused, insisting that, having been established through a presidential decree, another presidential decree was required for it to be dissolved. To date, President Hadi has not issued such a decree.", "In the meantime, Islah affiliates have leveraged the committee\u2019s apparent authority to assert control over the official security apparatuses in Taiz that had technically been under the governor\u2019s jurisdiction. Within these institutions, Islah has dismissed officials considered unloyal to it while promoting Islah affiliates. The committee has also facilitated the withdrawal of other anti-Houthi forces from areas around Taiz, in place of whom Islah-affiliated forces have moved in. Aiding Islah\u2019s expanding clout in Taiz are the group\u2019s strong grassroots support, local business ties, and loyalists in senior military positions. Currently, the largest anti-Houthi force unaffiliated with Islah still present in Taiz City is the Yemeni army\u2019s 35th Armoured Brigade, which has worked closely with the Abu al-Abbas Brigades and is backed by the UAE.", "http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6634", "(** B E H)", "Solar Power And The Yemeni Civil War", "Little about Yemen would suggest that it represents the next frontier for renewable energy.", "The Yemeni civil war has led to the destruction of countless electric power systems, more than halving the availability of electric power throughout the country.
