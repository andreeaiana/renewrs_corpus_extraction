According to informal statistics, 3 million Yemenis are estimated to be living in the Kingdom as official and unofficial migrants. The figure, however, has largely decreased in the three last years, after some one million people left the Arab Gulf country due to measures taken by Saudi authorities that imposed fees on residents and their families, in addition to the Saudization and nationalization of most of the jobs and other financial measures. Amid the acute decline in global oil prices, tens of thousands of (Yemeni and other) workers in the Kingdom will increasingly likely lose their jobs, as the Saudi-Russian oil war has decreased prices to less than 30 dollars for a barrel. While the two countries have retreated their venture in dropping oil prices and sinking the market with huge productions, this gamble has caused a gross deficit in budgets of the largest oil producers worldwide. Still, COVID-19 has doubled this deficit after closing Umra (religious visits to Mecca), with its impact seeming to include Haj. Saudi government may take very drastic fiscal actions, that could be painful too, the Saudi minister of finance told Al-Arabia TV on Saturday, in order to counter COVID-19 complications. The government is studying many options, Mohamed al-Jada'an added, stressing the need for decreasing some of the public budget expenditures. \"The Kingdom has never faced such a crisis\" as \"the revenues has seen massive decline. \"Among its priorities at present, the government is seeking to maintain jobs of citizens in the private sector, and to sustain basic services,\" the Saudi minister said. Al-Jada'an remarks affirm that the Kingdom would tend to impose further severe measures, including on the labor market, in which the Yemeni community is placed fourth; after the Indian, Egyptian and Pakistani.

These burdens will increase in the future, given the difficulty of the separation process at present and at least for the foreseeable future.", "The report stressed that the secession project will create a conflict of interests between the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which is not in the latest interest, at least for the time, because it prevents it from defeating or weakening the forces of the Sana\u2019a government.

The coalition had hoped that the Houthis would show a minimum of goodwill to revive the political process, following their acceptance of U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 call for a cease-fire in late March. Notwithstanding Houthi inflexibility, however, the coalition\u2019s extension of the cease-fire is an attempt to reaffirm its commitment to non-military action and show appreciation for Guterres\u2019 efforts. It is also aimed at easing difficulties during Ramadan and keeping the ball in the Houthis\u2019 court for another month given the global COVID-19 crisis.", "The Houthi rejection likely stems from the fact that structural shifts that have occurred since 2015 have worked in the group\u2019s favor.", "The Yemen Data Project, which recorded 164 individual airstrikes during the cease-fire, noted that the majority of these were conducted in two districts \u2014 Khabb Wa al-Sha'af in Jawf and Majzar in Marib \u2014 further reinforcing this narrative. The Houthis want the kingdom to suspend its airstrikes so they can deploy more military reinforcements and further concentrate their attacks along several frontlines. In other words, the Houthis have pinned their hopes on the coalition abiding by its announcement that it would isolate government-aligned forces, so that they can reap the benefits of rejecting the cease-fire and make territorial and resource gains.", "Against this backdrop, the coalition\u2019s airstrikes were instrumental in restraining Houthi military advances. It\u2019s also worth noting that the cease-fire announcement slowed down the government-aligned forces\u2019 efforts to recapture al-Hazm, the capital city of Jawf.
