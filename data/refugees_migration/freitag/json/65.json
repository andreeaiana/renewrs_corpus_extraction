The little knowledge that is recycled about the movement is typically misleading, and conducive to stereotypes and an underestimation of the group\u2019s military and strategic capabilities. The reality of today\u2019s Ansar Allah is both a skilled paramilitary force that has internalized the lessons of a decade and a half of war, as well as a political organization with the veneer of a social justice movement, which excels in the production of propaganda on the local and regional stages. The Huthis may, in fact, be the band of slogan-chanting tribesmen occasionally seen on major news networks, but they are also a remarkably resilient and dynamic entity that adapts to Yemen\u2019s ever-changing political landscape.", "The primary sources I will be referring to in an attempt to answer these questions include speeches given by the late leader Husayn al-Huthi, his brother and successor Abd al-Malik al-Huthi, and the official spokesperson for the movement, Muhammad Abd al-Salam.

The Zaydi Imamate of Northern Yemen had reigned for over a thousand years until the Republican Revolution of 1962. The Zaydi of Northern Yemen were particularity marginalized by government policies and this led to Northern Yemen functioning as a semi-autonomous region with very little control by the central Yemeni government. As a result, the region was economically neglected and was dependent largely on tribal networks to ensure services and sustenance. This lack of central government control created an environment where the spread of Zaydi Revivalism ideology could flourish and where a charismatic leader such as al Houthi could emerge.", "The rise of the Houthi as an Islamic social movement is representative of the larger regional movement of Shia Revivalism and represents the legitimate desires of a group of people to live under a government of their creation that is in line with their values and beliefs. While America\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia will always be affected and largely influenced by the Kingdom\u2019s seemingly endless supply of oil, it is necessary to view the Houthis as a legitimate popular movement and look to address the causes of their grievances and the US role in the region.

The little knowledge that is recycled about the movement is typically misleading, and conducive to stereotypes and an underestimation of the group\u2019s military and strategic capabilities. The reality of today\u2019s Ansar Allah is both a skilled paramilitary force that has internalized the lessons of a decade and a half of war, as well as a political organization with the veneer of a social justice movement, which excels in the production of propaganda on the local and regional stages. The Huthis may, in fact, be the band of slogan-chanting tribesmen occasionally seen on major news networks, but they are also a remarkably resilient and dynamic entity that adapts to Yemen\u2019s ever-changing political landscape.", "The primary sources I will be referring to in an attempt to answer these questions include speeches given by the late leader Husayn al-Huthi, his brother and successor Abd al-Malik al-Huthi, and the official spokesperson for the movement, Muhammad Abd al-Salam.

The Zaydi Imamate of Northern Yemen had reigned for over a thousand years until the Republican Revolution of 1962. The Zaydi of Northern Yemen were particularity marginalized by government policies and this led to Northern Yemen functioning as a semi-autonomous region with very little control by the central Yemeni government. As a result, the region was economically neglected and was dependent largely on tribal networks to ensure services and sustenance. This lack of central government control created an environment where the spread of Zaydi Revivalism ideology could flourish and where a charismatic leader such as al Houthi could emerge.", "The rise of the Houthi as an Islamic social movement is representative of the larger regional movement of Shia Revivalism and represents the legitimate desires of a group of people to live under a government of their creation that is in line with their values and beliefs. While America\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia will always be affected and largely influenced by the Kingdom\u2019s seemingly endless supply of oil, it is necessary to view the Houthis as a legitimate popular movement and look to address the causes of their grievances and the US role in the region.

The little knowledge that is recycled about the movement is typically misleading, and conducive to stereotypes and an underestimation of the group\u2019s military and strategic capabilities. The reality of today\u2019s Ansar Allah is both a skilled paramilitary force that has internalized the lessons of a decade and a half of war, as well as a political organization with the veneer of a social justice movement, which excels in the production of propaganda on the local and regional stages. The Huthis may, in fact, be the band of slogan-chanting tribesmen occasionally seen on major news networks, but they are also a remarkably resilient and dynamic entity that adapts to Yemen\u2019s ever-changing political landscape.", "The primary sources I will be referring to in an attempt to answer these questions include speeches given by the late leader Husayn al-Huthi, his brother and successor Abd al-Malik al-Huthi, and the official spokesperson for the movement, Muhammad Abd al-Salam.

These primary source materials will help in understanding how Ansar Allah is regarded by internal and external actors, as well as the rhetoric and ideology that characterize the group.

The Zaydi Imamate of Northern Yemen had reigned for over a thousand years until the Republican Revolution of 1962. The Zaydi of Northern Yemen were particularity marginalized by government policies and this led to Northern Yemen functioning as a semi-autonomous region with very little control by the central Yemeni government. As a result, the region was economically neglected and was dependent largely on tribal networks to ensure services and sustenance. This lack of central government control created an environment where the spread of Zaydi Revivalism ideology could flourish and where a charismatic leader such as al Houthi could emerge.", "The rise of the Houthi as an Islamic social movement is representative of the larger regional movement of Shia Revivalism and represents the legitimate desires of a group of people to live under a government of their creation that is in line with their values and beliefs. While America\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia will always be affected and largely influenced by the Kingdom\u2019s seemingly endless supply of oil, it is necessary to view the Houthis as a legitimate popular movement and look to address the causes of their grievances and the US role in the region.
