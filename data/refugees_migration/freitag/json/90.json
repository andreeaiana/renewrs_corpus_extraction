Rather, it has already been pushed into the abyss and therein continues to fall. After four years of war, Yemen has suffered the destruction of its infrastructure, economy, social fabric, and much more. Yemenis are a nation traumatized by human loss and starvation. In the past year, photos of malnourished children have become synonymous with Yemen worldwide. Yet, as much as it deserved the media attention, the story of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis at times concealed the fact that this is not a natural disaster that has befallen Yemen. It is an accumulation of political conflicts within the country, exacerbated by reckless regional interference backed by the world\u2019s Western powers.", "Aid organizations are now preparing for another year of humanitarian suffering. The United Nations has announced plans to raise funds amounting to $US4 billion \u2013 a third more than last year\u2019s appeal for roughly US$3 billion \u2013 with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates funding about a third of the appeal. However, humanitarian organizations are reaching their capacity limits, while the immense looting and confiscation of humanitarian supplies in which belligerent parties are engaged means aid itself is at times helping to finance the war instead of reaching those in need. Neither the coalition powers nor the Western countries backing them should therefore content themselves with pouring aid into Yemen. Yemen desperately needs political decisions to be made.", "At a closer look, developments last year demonstrated clearly that the crisis in Yemen is political at its core, and that\u2019s how it needs to be addressed. It was new geopolitical dynamics that encouraged decisions to contain Yemen\u2019s downward spiral toward the end of 2018 \u2013 even if decisions came late, unexpectedly, and at times resulted from events that on face value had little relation to the Yemen conflict.", "At the epicenter of the conflict and its shifting dynamics were the city of Hudaydah and the nearby ports \u2013 the last access Houthi forces have left to the Red Sea. These ports are also the entry point for most of the basic commodities feeding a nation descending into mass famine. For some two years the Saudi-led military coalition has been pushing for a military campaign to take Hudaydah. However, international concern \u2013 that cargo shipments would be interrupted and trigger a humanitarian catastrophe \u2013 has been intense, and the coalition was waiting for a green light from its main backers, the United States and the United Kingdom, to pursue the offensive. Near the midpoint of 2018, Washington gave what amounted to a \u201cyellow light\u201d, according to a US government official who spoke with the Sana\u2019a Center at the time.", "The strategic and military preparations for the campaign changed the calculations of various groups in the anti-Houthi coalition. For instance, the UAE had for the past several years built proxy militias in areas the Yemeni government is meant to control, with these militias often challenging the government\u2019s authority and some seeking to partition the country. In 2018, however, unity among anti-Houthi ground forces was seen as paramount for the battle for Hudaydah. With UAE prompting, these disparate groups closed ranks and put differences aside for the military campaign. Symbolic of this were the visits to Abu Dhabi by Yemeni President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi and Islah party leaders in 2018.", "Through the latter half of 2018, the coalition\u2019s efforts to drive the Houthis from Hudaydah progressed slowly and effectively stalled at the southern edge of the city, threatening to become a battle of attrition. Simultaneously, international pressure was building on Saudi Arabia \u2013 pressure that was then key to facilitating the UN-led peace consultations in Sweden and the Stockholm Agreement that halted the battle for Hudaydah. It was, however, not the possible starvation of millions of Yemenis that created the international momentum for peace consultations and a ceasefire. Rather, it was the media spectacle around the murder of one man, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, at his country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul that provoked international outcry and prompted Washington and London to force Riyadh\u2019s hand. Many Western leaders had been growing increasingly uncomfortable over reckless Saudi foreign policy and were embarrassed by reports of war crimes in Yemen committed by their ally, including bombing buses full of school children and siege tactics that have helped push the country toward mass starvation. However, while Western countries, above all the US and the UK, had enabled the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, they had no hand in Khashoggi\u2019s murder, which allowed for an opportunity to criticize Riyadh while claiming the moral high ground.", "The Stockholm Agreement, endorsed by the UN Security Council, came about thanks to international pressure, Saudi influence over the Yemeni government and the belligerent parties each wanting to avoid blame for the peace process\u2019 failure. At the same time both sides were hoping to gain an advantage. The UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths secured the warring parties\u2019 commitments not through compromise, but by watering down the language in the deal to the point that what the parties actually committed to is widely up to their own discretion. In the short time it has been since the talks, it is apparent the parties are interpreting their commitments quite differently. Neither regarded the talks as a stepping stone to a greater accord, but rather a localized accommodation.", "President Hadi \u2013 technically still a \u2018transitional president\u2019 who was meant to leave office in 2014 \u2013 also knows his exit from power is almost assured if and when a peace deal is signed. Hadi\u2019s choice to send a delegation to Sweden was, however, not his to make, given that he is beholden to his Saudi patrons. Indeed, Hadi has attempted to govern his country from Riyadh since 2015. The armed Houthi movement likewise attended the talks under duress. Their leadership is keenly aware that the greatest \u201cvictory\u201d they could possibly achieve at this point is to survive. The pummeling Houthi forces have been sustaining on the battlefield has left them smarting and looking for a way to ease the pressure.", "There is, however, little to no chance that the Houthis will cede a military defeat to their opponents. And while they have been militarily pressured, in the territories they control they have acted increasingly paranoid and continued to craft their own police state: persecuting minorities, staging show trials and executions, banning civil society groups and launching arrest campaigns to purge undesirables \u2013 such as free-thinking journalists, human rights advocates and others \u2013 institutionalizing the extortion of businesses, workers and aid organizations, conscripting children into combat roles, and propagating religious zealotry upon the masses. Before the Houthis took over, there was more than 20 daily and weekly independent newspapers publishing from Sana\u2019a. Today, there are only Houthi publications. Meanwhile, the ongoing war also pushed them closer to Tehran, which is ironic given that Saudi Arabia and the UAE launched their military intervention in Yemen to prevent what they saw as Iranian encroachment in their backyard.", "Thus, the war has become increasingly complex as it has proceeded, entrenching the clout of warlords and armed groups as it goes and advancing the country\u2019s fragmentation. This trend is likely to continue in the absence of a broader settlement to end the conflict. The details of what a political settlement would look like remain elusive, but some of the parameters are clear.", "[a very detailed review]", "http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6808", "(** B H)", "About 19 million lack access to clean water in Yemen", "Abdu Mohammed Yousuf, 23 years old, one of Al-Dumman village residents, located in the north of Bajil district of al-Hodeidah coastal province 'west of Yemen', rides a donkey cart for over 20 Km daily to get drinking water for his family that consists of 9 members five of them are female and four are male, the youngest of them is 3 years old.", "Ridding a local made donkey cart, the black skin Abdu Yousuf transfers 12 gallons from his home to a water well located 20 Km away of his home and back to his home daily under the heat of the burning sun.", "Among long ques, the young Abdu Yousuf waits his turn to fill his gallons with drinking water from a well that was dug and equipped by a wealthy citizen.", "\"I come here every four days to get safe drinking water,\" Abdu Yousuf told the Center of Yemen Humanitarian Relief and Development Organization (MONA) during a tour of the region.", "\"Sometimes I wait three hours until my turn comes,\" says Abdu Yusuf.", "\"The pumping of water into our house from the state water project has stopped because of the war that broke out and the lack of diesel,\" said Abdu Yousuf.", "Over 15 thousands capita from al-Dumman and al-Habil villages benefit from the well that was provided by a wealthy citizen.", "\"Our situations were better before the war\", \"We suffer so much now that we go long distances to get water,\" says young Abdu Yousuf.", "The total of renewable water sources in Yemen, according to the UN Water Statistics Report 2010, is estimated at 3.4 billion cubic meters a year, 900 million of which are covered by aquifers.

In addition to questioning the cohesiveness of government and rebel forces, it anecdotally details the rise of a robust, mafia-like war economy that creates disincentives for peace on both sides.

After all, if the disparate factions that make up either side lost the common enemy that binds them together, they may well fracture into opposing forces, creating a series of small civil wars across the country.", "On one side, the Hadi government is unable to exert authority over the areas it claims to control, its repeated non-payment of salaries has contributed to troop discontent, and it faces intense and often violent opposition by some southern forces.

The panel suggests there are \u201csigns\u201d that the Houthis are becoming less politically inclusive in their leadership ranks\u2014a fact that likely exacerbates the broader lack of cohesion. Indeed, the panel notes that the Houthis are \u201cfacing slightly increasing levels of dissent\u201d from major tribes and at the street level.

Inevitably, those who benefit from this economy are far less inclined to facilitate a transition to peace, and they could act as spoilers if their interests are threatened. These elements include many important stakeholders in the north and south, some with roles in Houthi or Hadi governing structures.", "For example, to finance the war effort, the Houthis rely on rents and fees in Sana that the government used to collect. According to last year\u2019s panel report, this revenue totaled at least 407 billion Yemeni riyals ($1.6 billion). Moreover, they collect import taxes at Hodeida and al-Salif ports, and at a checkpoint in Dhamar province through which nearly all of the country\u2019s imports pass, even those originating from entry points not under Houthi control.", "The panel also notes that the Houthis make significant sums by taxing oil donated by Iran\u2014perhaps tens of millions of dollars per month. The oil is imported through Hodeida with falsified paperwork suggesting an origin in the United Arab Emirates or Oman, though the true origin is Iran. This allows vessels to avert detection by the coalition or UN maritime monitors.", "In addition to funding the Houthi war effort, the war economy has created ample opportunities for corruption on both sides of the conflict.
