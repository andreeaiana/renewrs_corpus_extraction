Ausgehend von diesem Eindruck, wonach die Berichterstattung über den Konflikt weder quantitativ zufriedenstellend noch inhaltlich adäquat ist, soll hier die Frage gestellt werden: Wie voreingenommen bzw. wie neutral ist die Verbreitung von Informationen über den Jemenkrieg in den deutschsprachigen Mainstream-Online-Medien?</p> <p>Dazu wäre natürlich eine größere empirische Untersuchung notwendig, die im Rahmen dieses Beitrags nur ansatzweise möglich ist. Im Folgenden liegt mein Fokus auf der Wortwahl, dem Sprachgebrauch - und welche Einstellungen dieser impliziert. Der Rahmen dieses Beitrags ist ein recht enger: Untersucht wurden 10 Onlinemedien mit insgesamt 27 Einzelbeiträgen. Entsprechend der wachsenden Bedeutung der Online-Medien liegt mein Schwerpunkt auf Informationen, die im Internet zu finden sind. Mein besonderes Augenmerk gilt den Standard-Formulierungen, nach denen die Huthis als "vom Iran unterstützte" "Rebellen" gelten, wohingegen die "Regierung" als eine "international anerkannten Regierung" tituliert wird. Auch das Narrativ "Sunni gegen Schia" findet sich in der Hälfte der Hauptmedien. Diese in den deutschsprachigen Online-Mainstream-Medien häufig gebrauchten Formulierungen sind zwar faktisch nicht falsch, haben jedoch Implikationen, die für den Jemenkrieg nicht angemessen sind: Sie lassen wichtige Aspekte ungesagt.</p> <p>1 Die Darstellung des Kriegs in den Mainstream-Online-Medien</p> <p>Untersucht wurden von mir (im Folgenden kurz bezeichnet als: <em>die Hauptmedien</em>): Die Online-Portale von <em>ARTE</em>, <em>Das Erste</em>, der <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</em> (FAZ), dem <em>Standard</em> aus Österreich, dem <em>SPIEGEL</em>, der <em>Süddeutschen Zeitung</em> (SZ), der <em>Tageszeitung</em> (taz), der <em>Welt</em>, dem <em>ZDF</em> und der <em>Zeit</em>. Von jedem dieser Online-Nachrichtendienste wurden mehrere Berichte zum Thema analysiert, insgesamt 27 Beiträge, davon 18 Textbeiträge, 7 Videos und 2 Podcasts</p> <p>Tabelle 1 zeigt eine Auflistung der wichtigsten Ergebnisse: welche gleichen Wortphrasen (in Anführungszeichen) oder inhaltlich ähnliche Formulierungen (ohne Anführungszeichen) in wie vielen aus den 10 Hauptmedien benutzt werden. Dabei muss sich die betreffende Phrase oder eine inhaltliche ähnliche Formulierung pro Hauptmedium in mindestens einem der Beiträge finden.</p> <p>Auffällig war zusätzlich, dass ausführlichere Beiträge, wie etwa die beiden Podcast-Folgen (veröffentlicht von der <em>SZ</em> und <em>Das Erste</em>), deutlich differenzierter Bericht erstatteten. </p> <p>2 Interpretation der Ergebnisse</p> <p>Erneut sei betont, dass es sich bei der vorgelegten Untersuchung nicht um eine repräsentative Studie handelt. Nichtsdestoweniger zeichnen die in den 27 Beiträgen gebrauchten Formulierungen und Inhalte ein grobes Bild von der Darstellung des Jemenkriegs in deutschsprachigen Online-Mainstream-Medien. An dieser Stelle muss analysiert werden, was die Verwendung derjenigen Wortphrasen, deren Ergebnisse am deutlichsten sind, impliziert.</p> <p>Am häufigsten, nämlich in jedem Hauptmedium in mindestens einem Beitrag, finden sich die Begrifflichkeiten der Huthis als "Rebellen" (A) und deren Unterstützung durch den Iran (D). Diese beiden Behauptungen, die man als Konsument deutscher Medien so häufig hört, sind nicht explizit falsch - lassen aber vieles ungesagt.</p> <p>Die zweite Formulierung, die in jedem Hauptmedium vorkommt, ist die These, die Huthis seien vom Iran "unterstützt", mit dem Iran "verbündet" oder der Iran "[stünde] hinter ihnen" (D). Aus den 27 Einzelquellen benutzten 23 eine dieser Bezeichnungen. </p> <p>Nun zu C: d.h., zur Reduktion der Kriegsgründe auf einen religiösen Konflikt von Sunniten versus Schiiten. Man beachte: Nur diejenigen Berichte, die den Krieg auf den religiösen Konflikt zu reduzieren scheinen, sind in den Ergebnissen von C berücksichtigt. Und das ist immerhin bei der Hälfte der Hauptmedien der Fall.</p> <p>In Wirklichkeit ist die Behauptung, der Jemenkrieg sei auf eine Rivalität zwischen Sunniten und Schiiten zurückzuführen, ganz fehl am Platz.</p> <p>3 Bewertung und Schlussfolgerung</p> <p>Es gibt in den untersuchten deutschsprachigen Online-Medien durchaus Stellen, an denen die kritisierten Formulierungen nicht einfach kopiert, deren Gehalt vielmehr kritisch hinterfragt wird. Doch solche differenzierteren Berichterstattungen über den Jemenkrieg sind die Ausnahme - und fehlen insbesondere in kurzen Formaten oft ganz. Gerade die kürzeren Beiträge, etwa innerhalb von Nachrichtensendungen, sind jedoch wichtig für die Meinungsbildung der breiten Bevölkerung. Sie erreichen eine größere Zielgruppe als etwa Podcasts. Dass kürzere Meldungen einfacher sein müssen als Podcasts, ist klar. Aber auch bessere Verständlichkeit für das Publikum darf kein Grund für die Verwendung verfälschender Wendungen sein – von Cornelia Mayer</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Der-Jemenkrieg-und-die-Medien-4494675.html">https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Der-Jemenkrieg-und-die-Medien-4494675.html</a></span></p> <p><span>Kommentar: <a href="https://www.heise.de/forum/Telepolis/Kommentare/Der-Jemenkrieg-und-die-Medien/zu-leicht/posting-35063506/show/">zu leicht</a></span></p> <p>Sicher korrekt, was Frau Mayer ausführt. Ich verstehe nur nicht, warum man die Relotius-Medien und ihre arg propagandistisch verdrehte Darstellung z. B. - leider bei weitem nicht nur - des genozidalen Krieges im Jemen dermassen vorsichtig, gleichsam wie wenn man es mit rohen Eiern zu tun hätte, thematisieren muss, wie sie es tut.</p> <p>Da wär noch viel mehr zu sagen. Erstens ist die Gemengelage noch viel komplexer als dargestellt. Es fehlt die gerade jetzt virulente Rolle der Emiratis, die Sache mit den Separatisten, der Einfluss der Kaida etc.</p> <p>Bezüglich medialer Berichterstattung fehlt z. B. die permanente Verharmlosung der Folgen des Krieges, etwa die seit Jahren andauernde Wiederholung der immer identischen Opferzahl, nämlich 10'000, mittlerweile 'mindestens' 10'000. Wie würde man reagieren, wenn jemand sagte, im 2. Weltkrieg seien 'mindestens 1 Million Menschen' umgekommen? Formal durchaus korrekt, aber inhaltlich eben doch eine Lüge.</p> <p>Und es fehlt ein Resümee. Eins, das die Qualität der Berichterstattung der 'Qualitätsmedien' konkret benennt.</p> <p>Der Versuch, neutral über Vorgänge wie den Jemen-Krieg zu referieren greift notwendigerweise zu kurz. Es gibt Umstände, die sich Neutralität verweigern. Das sollte gerade jemand aus dem deutschen Sprachraum eigentlich wissen.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.heise.de/forum/Telepolis/Kommentare/Der-Jemenkrieg-und-die-Medien/zu-leicht/posting-35063506/show/">https://www.heise.de/forum/Telepolis/Kommentare/Der-Jemenkrieg-und-die-Medien/zu-leicht/posting-35063506/show/</a></span></p> <p><span>Mein Kommentar: Die Ergänzung des Kommentars ist korrekt. Und es werden die furchtbaren Folgen des saudischen Luftkrieges und der Blockade weitgehend ausgeblendet. Alles in allem aber eine lesenswerte Schlaglichtaufnahme der deutschen Mainstreammedien anhand ausgewählter Beispiele. Und auch bei englischsprachigen Mainstreammedien sieht es – von einigen wenigen Ausnahmen abgesehen – nicht viel besser aus. Auch hier zeigt sich wieder einmal: bei allen wesentlichen weltpolitischen Ereignissen und Fragen sind die Mainstreammedien Teil eines umfassenden Propagandanetzwerks.</span></p> <p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p> <p><strong>The Worsening Saudi Quagmire In Yemen</strong></p> <p>Saudi Arabia’s agony in Yemen, a product of its reckless military adventurism since spring 2015, has now become worse by the Yemeni separatist coup in Aden </p> <p>In their various pronouncements, the STC leaders have made it abundantly clear that they are not interested in Yemen’s reunification and their ultimate objective is a ‘back to the past’ resurrection of an independent South Yemen government, irrespective of the wish of the Saudi-led coalition, which has waged a long war in the name of restoring the deposed Yemeni government to rule over all of Yemen</p> <p>The separatist coup is, simultaneously, a major blow to the UN-led efforts which are based on the deeply-flawed UN Security Council Resolution of 2216 that calls for the reinstatement of Hadi’s government and the unilateral disarmament of the Houthi forces</p> <p>Contrary to what has become an article of faith in Western media and the vocabulary of most Western experts, to call Hadi’s government “legitimate” is a misnomer. Lest we forget, Hadi was the vice-president of a corrupt and dictatorial regime that was toppled by the infliction of the Arab Spring, his 2-year interim appointment ran out in 2014 and was unduly extended by the National Dialogue Conference without the benefit of an election. Irrespective, the Saudi-led coalition, whose own history is rife with repeated palace coups and authoritarianism, used Hadi’s call for external intervention against the Houthis to pulverize an entire nation</p> <p>The question for the Saudis now, who are still reeling by the negative results of their murder of the dissident Khashoggi in their consulate in Istanbul last October, is how they can continue business as usual with respect to Hadi, when in fact the mask has fallen and the man is increasingly a liability rather than an asset for Riyadh’s objectives in Yemen? It is possible that the reported rifts between Saudi Arabia and UAE over Aden is to some extent exaggerated and that is why the Saudi forces did not rush to assist the government forces during the August 7-10 clashes in Aden, letting the chips fall where they may. Of course, the Saudis have to save face by pretending that they are still fully committed to the Hadi government, which in the best circumstance can survive by allowing a huge influx of STC and thus turning into the latter’s Trojan horse. </p> <p>Another big question is how the changes in Aden affect the trajectory of war in Yemen? Can the South turn into an “island of peace and stability” under the STC control, or will it simply sow the seeds of another north/south conflict down the road?</p> <p>From the vantage point of north Yemen, the resource-rich south Yemen should not be independent as this would exact a toll on the north’s economy. Yemen’s oil belongs to all Yemen people and not just those inhabiting the southern provinces, all the more reason for the UN to press on a revised script for Yemen federalism, and to pressure the Arab coalition from partitioning Yemen following the familiar ‘divide and conquer’ maxim, recalling how the Saudis fueled the fire of separatism during the 1990s. Today, the incoherence of their dual approach, in giving political support to a government of “national unity” while aiding the separatists, has reaped a bitter harvest, which has been described by some as a “civil war within a civil war,” although the basic problem with this description is overlooking that the Yemen war is first and foremost a war of aggression by a group of authoritarian oil monarchies against their poor yet defiant neighbor – by Kaveh L. Afriasabi</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.irdiplomacy.ir/en/news/1985572/the-worsening-saudi-quagmire-in-yemen">http://www.irdiplomacy.ir/en/news/1985572/the-worsening-saudi-quagmire-in-yemen</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.eurasiareview.com/15082019-the-worsening-saudi-quagmire-in-yemen-oped/">https://www.eurasiareview.com/15082019-the-worsening-saudi-quagmire-in-yemen-oped/</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Violence In Aden Tests Emirati-Saudi Alliance</strong></p> <p>For years analysts have opined over the extent to which the UAE and Saudi Arabia’s opposing stakes in Yemen could damage the Abu Dhabi-Riyadh alliance. Yet considering how the Emiratis and Saudis view countless issues in the Middle East and North Africa through extremely similar lenses, many concluded that conflicting interests vis-à-vis southern Yemen had little potential to harm the two GCC states’ strong relationship.</p> <p>In response to observers discussing the notion of a major rift in Emirati-Saudi relations, many media outlets in Saudi Arabia have dismissed such talk as Qatari or Iranian propaganda. Such reporting from the kingdom’s press platforms seems to suggest that the official narrative in Saudi Arabia is that Riyadh and Abu Dhabi’s differences are merely tactical and that both GCC capitals remain close. It is difficult to predict how real differences in Emirati and Saudi foreign policy vis-à-vis southern Yemen will impact Abu Dhabi and Riyadh’s bilateral ties. Nonetheless, such division within the anti-Houthi front cannot be ignored, especially in light of recent events.</p> <p>Yemen’s Southern Transition Council (STC) maintains that Muslim Brotherhood elements have infiltrated Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi’s government. This is the basis of the secessionists’ narrative about a common struggle against a ‘terrorist government’ that Riyadh supports. Meanwhile, Hadi’s loyalists depict the STC as having carried out an illegitimate coup against Yemen’s internationally recognized government. The extent to which there can be any common ground between these sides remains to be seen.</p> <p>Experts have noted that the southern separatists are attempting to appeal to the Saudi leadership. Their main means of doing so is emphasizing their anti-Houthi/anti-Iranian credentials, pointing to how forces in the south have played a central role in terms of working with the Arab coalition to fight the Tehran-sponsored insurgents. Nonetheless, it is difficult to imagine a common opposition to Ansurallah being the basis of a problem-free relationship between Riyadh and the Emirati-backed southern separatists.</p> <p>As long as the Saudis insist on maintaining Yemeni unity while the Emiratis support southern secessionists, there will be tension between them. Such competing agendas will inevitably create an increasingly complicated situation in the war-torn country.</p> <p>It will be important to look at how Abu Dhabi and Riyadh manage their conflicting interests in southern Yemen. One of the key factors that will determinate how such tensions evolve is the extent to which the Emirati leadership goes all out in terms of supporting the southern separatists in Aden. Without another Arab state or any government in the West supporting recognition of an independent South Yemen, Abu Dhabi would certainly be setting itself up for confrontation with other states if it were to go all in the way in terms of backing the separatists.</p> <p>That Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) <span><a href="https://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/yemen-talks-a-priority-uae-and-saudi-leaders-say-at-makkah-meeting-1.897507">came</a></span> to Mecca on August 12 to discuss the deteriorating security crisis in Aden with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman underscored the extent to which there is a mutual desire on both Abu Dhabi’s and Riyadh’s part to prevent Yemen’s ‘southern question’ from fueling friction in the Emirati-Saudi alliance – by Giorgio Cafiero</p> <p><span><a href="https://lobelog.com/violence-in-aden-tests-emirati-saudi-alliance/">https://lobelog.com/violence-in-aden-tests-emirati-saudi-alliance/</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** A P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Important Political Statement by the Southern Transitional Council</strong></p> <p>Today, the South is witnessing a historic moment, made by the victories of our people and putting it on the threshold of a new phase, the culmination of a strenuous struggle full of enormous sacrifices, which have been incurred by our people for two and a half decades since the occupation of the South in 1994. And lastly the events of this month that led to securing the city of Aden and the security and stability of the South, after a crisis that was imposed on the Transitional Council which managed the events with a high degree of wisdom and responsibility, and was keen to save lives, and miss the opportunity on the enemies of the South, and block their bets.</p> <p>We applaud our great Southern people, all its sectors and constituencies have proven their keenness to encircle and contain this crisis, based on the approach and culture of Southern reconciliation and tolerance, which was the decisive element in ending the crisis and stop its repercussions, and a legendary urgency in the defense of its national gains, with the million people rally for stability and victory of the popular will.</p> <p>We also applaud those leaders and individuals who have consciously aligned themselves with the will of the people of the South and have declared their accession to the Southern forces, of which they are already an integral part since the battle for victory over the Iranian expansion in 2015.</p> <p>We do not forget to pay tribute to the Arab Coalition countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and thank their unremitting efforts to contain the crisis, and the call on both parties of the conflict to invoke dialogue under their sponsorship, which will be held in Jeddah once the necessary arrangements are completed, and thanks to all countries and regional and international organizations for their efforts to contain this crisis. We expect them to be more responsive to the hopes and aspirations of our people.</p> <p>Despite the complexities we have faced in the wake of this crisis, which have revealed to the regional and international public opinion that our just cause is the issue of a people, a nation, a state and an identity, an independent political issue with its roots and dimensions since the occupation of the South in 1994, and that any further procrastination in dealing positively with it in accordance with the will of the people of the South will generate further complications and risks to the security and safety of the region and the world. This is what we sought in the declared and undeclared political positions that expressed the concern of regional and international powers, and international human rights organizations, during the recent events in Aden.</p> <p>The historical responsibility placed on us as the leadership of the Transitional Council, necessitates that we deal responsibly with reality, consistent with the gravity of the requirements of the current phase and entitlements, by implementing a clear national strategy, based on general guidelines, shown as follows:</p> <p>-The goal of the people of the South to restore the independent federal state of the South is an irreversible and irrevocable choice.</p> <p>– All the people of the South are partners in the victory, and partners in taking responsibility for the consolidation of security and stability and institution-building.</p> <p>– Managing the repercussions of the events of Aden and its consequences in order to enhance the cohesion of the Southern social fabric and restore the city of Aden.</p> <p>– To take care of the families of martyrs and wounded of both sides of the recent events and all martyrs of the South, and to treat them responsibly and equally.</p> <p>– Based on the foundations and literature of the Southern Transitional Council as expressed in the historic Aden Declaration and popular mandate, that the South is for all its sons and all its children, on the basis of reconciliation, tolerance and national partnership, we affirm that any Southerner that participated in these events consciously or unconsciously, are our comrades and brothers. We have a responsibility to reassure them and give them security, and it is their responsibility to participate in securing and building the South, except those belonging to terrorist groups.</p> <p>– Criminalize and punish anyone who exploits his position to practice corruption, nepotism or to serve a self-interest.</p> <p>– Rejection of the policy of treason and the imposition of charges and the promotion of rumors to settle political disagreements.</p> <p>– To conduct a serious dialogue, which removes the isolation arising from the mistakes of the past, and provide a solid ground for independence, by reaching a national consensus formula, which guarantees the South an active and strong presence at the upcoming negotiating table.</p> <p>– To mobilize all available national efforts, capabilities, capacities and competencies; to manage the South in a rational and exemplary manner, and to face the rubble of the contracts of decades of looting, obliteration, corruption and deprivation.</p> <p>– We direct the local authorities in the capital Aden, and all governorates of the South to assume their service and civil responsibilities, in the normalization of the situation, and meet the needs and requirements of the citizens, especially the services of electricity, water, sanitation, fuel and medicine, and all requirements related to people’s lives, improve their efficiency urgently, and neutralize the services and interests of the people from any political conflict, and affirm the Council’s intolerance towards any messes or corruption.</p> <p>[…]</p> <p>– Standing fully with the Arab coalition, and continue to resist Houthi and Iranian expansion in the region.</p> <p>– Commitment to dialogue as an ideal means of resolving political disputes, settling international disputes, and willingness to participate in any dialogue sponsored by the Arab Alliance, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the United Nations or the Arab League.</p> <p>– Our battle with terrorism is an open one, which requires the support of the regional and international community for our forces, and the strengthening of the capabilities of the security and anti-terrorism services to eradicate it from all Southern territories.</p> <p>– support the northern national resistance against Houthi militias and Iranian expansion, with our categorical rejection of any northern military presence on the territory of the South; as its natural place is to confront the Houthi invasion.</p> <p>– Ensure the freedom of work and movement of the northern brothers in the capital Aden and all Southern governorates, with the need to commit to carry identification documents and complete the necessary security measures, in order to protect them and maintain public security.</p> <p>Mercy to the righteous Southern martyrs</p> <p>And the speedy recovery of the wounded</p> <p>And freedom for prisoners in Houthi militia prisons.</p> <p>Issued by the Southern Transitional Council, August 15, 2019</p> <p><span><a href="https://stc-eu.org/en/political-statement-by-the-southern-transitional-council/">https://stc-eu.org/en/political-statement-by-the-southern-transitional-council/</a></span> = <span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/13040">http://en.adenpress.news/news/13040</a></span></p> <p><span>and in short:</span></p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p><span>Lengthy new </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/STC?src=hashtag_click">#STC</a></span><span> Statement will inflame tensions with </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hashtag_click">#Yemen</a></span><span> gov.

Recited by: Mohamed Nasser Al-Nawaseri. <br /> In the name of God, Most Merciful and Most Gracious.<br /> Our glorious southern people: <br /> Today, we are here in Aden, capital of the south and carrier of its national identity. We are here in the square of victory with all it symbolizes of sacrifices and struggles accumulated in our people’s mass memory, to express our attitudes of loyalty, determination and resistance of tyranny. We are here to declare our free national will to restore our southern independent state on its recognized borders before May 21st, 1990. <br /> Our brave citizens of the South: <br /> We are here to renew our loyalty to the bloods of southern martyrs and declare our support to the attitudes of the southern transitional council and its president Aidarous Al-Zubaidi and all measures taken by the council to protect the gains of our people and preserving the southern rights, fortunes and national destiny. Therefore, we assert the following: <br /> • What happened recently in Aden was the inevitable result of the mentality of Sanaa’s regimen and its Houthi and Terrorist Forces, in addition to the failure of successive governments of the legitimacy that became like a guillotine on the neck of our people since the liberation of Aden four years ago. These acts hindered restoring normal life and services, security and economic situations of our people, in spit of the generous support provided by the Arab Coalition. <br /> • We declare our full support of all measures taken by the southern resistance to protect our people and restore security and stability all over Aden as a necessary measure to eliminate terrorism and extreme elements. <br /> • We demand president Aidarous Kassem Al-Zubaidi, president of the Southern Transitional Council and Supreme Commander of Southern Resistance Forces, who was delegated publicly by Aden Historic Declaration on May 4th, 2017, to assume his historical responsibility delegated to him by the people to restore our independent state. <br /> • We demand the international society and the Arab Coalition to turn the administration of the south to the southern transitional council as a representative of the southern people. <br /> • We demand the international society and the Arab Coalition led by Saudi Arabia and UAE to respect the will of our southern people as a major partner with the Arab Coalition in facing the Iranian expansion in the region and fighting terrorism and to achieve the goals of the Arab Coalition in restoring stability of the region and the whole world. <br /> • We welcome and appreciate the invitation of Saudi Arabia to the Southern Transitional Council to talk with the legitimacy as we actually appreciate this act. <br /> • We demand all sectors of the southern society to preserve the gains and achievement of southern resistance in addition to preserving public and private properties and fostering the spirit and values of civil culture, peaceful coexistence and social security and safety. <br /> • We appreciate the heroic deeds of our southern resistance and its glorious victories and achievements and we demand them to continue clearing off all southern territories from terrorism and occupation in Bihan, Hadhramaut valley, Mukiras and everywhere in our beloved south.</p> <p>We ask God for mercy to martyrs and quick healing to the injured<br /> Long Live the South, Free and Independent</p> <p><span><a href="https://en.smanews.org/final-statement-issued-by-the_million_march_of_empowerment_and_persistnce-in-aden">https://en.smanews.org/final-statement-issued-by-the_million_march_of_empowerment_and_persistnce-in-aden</a></span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p>"Constitutional Declaration" in Aden. A statement of transition adheres to the administration of the South and pledges to extend its control to Hadramout and Bayhan</p> <p>On Thursday, the Southern Transitional Council (STC) confirmed its continued "restoration of the state of the south", and did not retreat from its victories that led to its control over Aden, expressing thanks to Saudi Arabia for containing the crisis and calling on both sides of the conflict to resort to dialogue under its auspices.</p> <p>This was stated in a political statement issued by the presidency of the Council on Thursday, which included public directives to the administration of the southern provinces as a fait accompli authority away from the legitimate government and the Arab alliance.</p> <p>Observers described the statement as a "new constitutional declaration" in southern Yemen, recalling the constitutional declaration announced by the Houthi group following its 2015 coup in Sanaa.</p> <p>The Council said in the statement that the responsibility of its leaders is to deal responsibly with reality, based on public directives that included not to back down from what was achieved in Aden, and to partner all the south in victory and to care for the families of those killed on both sides.</p> <p>The transitional statement made no reference to the legitimate government and the recognition of its legitimacy, or withdrawal, but he referred to Saudi Arabia's role in ending tensions after it, and its willingness to engage in a dialogue sponsored if the arrangements were completed.</p> <p>The statement included directives to the security and military agencies and various sectors</p> <p>The statement and the action directives announced by the southern transitional, the government's short program, is similar to any coup d'état , and the council was based on the masses that rallied on Thursday in support of last week's military coup,</p> <p><span><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/170687">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/170687</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B C P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Yemen: A Civil War Centuries in the Making</strong></p> <p>As Asher Orkaby explains this month, the current conflict has deep roots in how Yemen emerged as a nation, its treatment under British rule, its role during the Cold War, and now as a proxy for tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The fractures within Yemen make this humanitarian crisis one of the most complex to solve.</p> <p>Alternatively, one could trace the origins of the current conflict to the 9<sup>th</sup>-century arrival of Zaydi Islam in Yemen and the gradual emergence of a class of religious and political elites, the descendants of whom are currently leading the Houthi movement.</p> <p>A more manageable historical origin narrative begins in September 1962, at the contentious founding of the modern Yemeni republic. Its creation upended the status quo that had dominated South Arabia for more than 1,000 years, pitting a new generation of revolutionaries against a staunchly conservative religious and tribal class.</p> <p>The original conflicts that precipitated the country’s first civil war during the 1960s remain at the core of the current conflict between the Houthi movement and the Republic of Yemen. Resolving this war will require not only a temporary cessation of hostilities, but also a more complete reevaluation of the Yemeni state.</p> <p>A Fragmented Country</p> <p>The ongoing war in Yemen is not a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran as is sometimes asserted. Nor is it a religious war between <span><a href="http://origins.osu.edu/article/tradition-vs-charisma-sunni-shii-divide-muslim-world">the Sunni and Shi’i sects of Islam</a></span>. Rather this is a unique moment wherein the Yemenis must decide the future of their country.</p> <p>The civil war that began in 2014 between the northern population and the republic can be seen as a continuation of the country’s first civil war between a traditional, religious, and tribal society from the northern countryside and a republic led by an educated and urban elite.</p> <p>The secession of hostilities in 1970 can, in retrospect, be seen as only a temporary truce that resulted in the marginalization of the defeated northern highlands. The children and grandchildren of those same defeated tribesmen who had supported the deposed Imam al-Badr, have now returned to the capital city of Sana’a demanding political retribution and remaining undeterred by a republic bereft of its revolutionary legitimacy.</p> <p>Rather, a decentralized federalist state that provides equal degrees of autonomy and resource sharing to southern separatists, northern Houthis, and other traditionally independent regions in Yemen might form the foundations of a future Yemeni state—one that will both assuage Saudi fears of a strong Yemeni state and provide political and economic opportunity to a new generation of Yemeni leadership.</p> <p>Throwing money at the problem will not immediately solve the crisis, nor will it ensure the long-term stability of South Arabia. Rather than isolate Yemen as a pariah state, the wealthy Gulf countries would benefit from incorporating 28 million Yemenis into the Gulf economy, alleviating border tensions, and empowering Yemenis to chart their own paths – by Asher Orkaby</p> <p><span><a href="http://origins.osu.edu/article/yemen-civil-war-houthi-humanitarian-crisis-arabia-zaydi">http://origins.osu.edu/article/yemen-civil-war-houthi-humanitarian-crisis-arabia-zaydi</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>A Perverse and Ominous Enterprise: The Death Penalty and Illegal Executions in Saudi Arabia</strong></p> <p>Report prepared by Helena Kennedy, Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws QC</p> <p>Saudi Arabia’s recent use of the death penalty should be viewed in the context of systemic and egregious human rights violations, including the widespread use of arbitrary arrest and detention (particularly since late 2017) to target political opponents and silence dissent, and the well-documented and indiscriminate use of airstrikes to target civilian populations in Yemen since 2015. It should also, of course, be seen in the context of the extrajudicial execution of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018. The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has recently concluded that this was a premeditated murder for which Saudi Arabia bears state responsibility, and that a number of high-level Saudi officials including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman are personally implicated. Accordingly, she has determined that the killing was a clear violation of Jamal Khashoggi’s right to life, and that the gruesome circumstances also amounted to a violation of the prohibitions on torture and on enforced and involuntary disappearances.4 Whilst this context is important, this report focuses on those who have recently been executed in Saudi Arabia itself, who are currently on death row in Saudi Arabia, or who are at real risk of being sentenced to death. In particular, this report draws attention to the plight of political activists and minors who have been executed or are the subject of threatened executions.</p> <p>In preparing this report, a number of persons directly affected by recent and threatened executions have been interviewed, including relatives and lawyers of victims. Whilst some are prepared for information and quotes to be attributed to them as set out below in Section E, a number wish to remain anonymous due to concerns for their safety and that of their family members. The individuals interviewed are willing to assist the international fact-finding mission which is the subject of Recommendation 4 below, as well as the relevant Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council.</p> <p>The evidence reviewed demonstrates frequent and heavy-handed recourse to the death penalty by Saudi Arabia in recent months. At least 149 people were executed in 2018, with at minimum 46 remaining on death row at the end of the year. It seems that many of those 46 individuals have now been executed, with at least 134 death sentences having been carried out between 1 January and 20 July 2019 alone.6 Should executions continue at this rate, the 2019 death toll will far exceed all previous recorded totals.</p> <p>A large number of deeply disturbing themes emerge from the evidence relating to the 2019 executions. 7 A significant proportion of those executed were political dissidents, and a number were children at the time of their alleged offending. Three were women. Many were arraigned on ill-defined charges of ‘espionage’ and ‘terrorism’ pursuant to unacceptably vague and broad laws. These, and many others, had been convicted only of non-violent or non-lethal crimes. Victims were frequently held incommunicado for prolonged periods and tortured, and the domestic proceedings against them were characterised by gross violations of the right to a fair trial. Some of those killed had been the subject of international media attention and/or communications by the Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council. In one particularly alarming case, an individual had been designated as ‘no longer at risk’ by the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions on the strength of assertions by the Saudi Arabian authorities, before ultimately being killed in the mass execution which took place on 23 April 2019. The mode of killing, too, is shocking. Executions are usually by way of public beheading, and have increasingly taken place en masse. In some cases, the mutilated bodies of those killed have been left on public display for extended periods, rather than being disposed of swiftly and with dignity. I was informed by those representing families that the remains of the deceased were routinely not returned to them, and they were frequently not even told where their loved ones had been buried.</p> <p>Each of these features connotes a grave violation of international human rights norms. Most pressingly, the execution of persons who were minors at the time of their alleged offences, or for the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, or following unfair trials, amounts to a clear violation of the right to life itself. Further, the mode of killing is frequently inconsistent with international law, rendering the execution arbitrary and in breach of the prohibition on cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p> <p>Dozens more are currently at imminent risk of execution, in circumstances where their killing would be clearly unlawful.</p> <p>It is important to note that Saudi Arabia’s recent excessive use of the death penalty comes in the midst of a concerted campaign against human rights defenders and political activists.</p> <p><span><a href="https://arabi21.com/UP/SEVEN%20Earth/KSA%20-%20Report%20on%20Use%20of%20the%20Death%20Penalty%202019%20.pdf">https://arabi21.com/UP/SEVEN%20Earth/KSA%20-%20Report%20on%20Use%20of%20the%20Death%20Penalty%202019%20.pdf</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1b Am wichtigsten: Kampf um Hodeidah / Most important: Hodeidah battle</span></h2> <p><span>(A K pS)</span></p> <p>Houthi group targeted the villages of Tehtya district in Hodeida city, damaging a number of civilian houses and triggering fear and panic among the people.</p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1162799868143910912">https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1162799868143910912</a></span></p> <p><span>(A K pS)</span></p> <p>Houthi militia targets civilian houses in Hodeida with mortar shells</p> <p><span><a href="http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/17/1-47/">http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/17/1-47/</a></span></p> <p><span>(A K pS)</span></p> <p>Houthis target civilian and military areas in Hodeidah</p> <p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/13043">http://en.adenpress.news/news/13043</a></span></p> <p><span>(A K pH)</span></p> <p><span>Mass protests condemn UN silence on Durayhimi siege</span></p> <p><span>Protesters condemn "UN complicity" and call for decisive action to lift siege</span></p> <p>Residents of Hodeidah province have on Friday condemned what they deemed UN complicity in the siege imposed on Durayhimi city for almost two years, as well as the </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.uprising.today/mass-protests-condemn-un-silence-on-durayhimi-siege/">https://www.uprising.today/mass-protests-condemn-un-silence-on-durayhimi-siege/</a></span></p> <p><span>(A K pH)</span></p> <p>In Hodeidah, a civilian was injured in At-tohayta district.

The Saudis and their allies continue to show a disregard for the protection of civilians and the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in the conduct of hostilities.</p> <p>The same brutality is still happening in Afghanistan and Syria as well, where the United States and its allies target civilians in their indiscriminate airstrikes. </p> <p>Tragically, the only thing the UN has done thus far is condemning these repeated killings – even though the world body is fully in the know that the unprovoked aggression against Yemen is for all the wrong reasons. The unprovoked conflict is in fact a smokescreen. The alliance between Saudi, American and Israeli interests gives the false story about the alleged Iranian takeover of Yemen additional legs, passed on to “fakestream” media from Tel Aviv. Fanning a bogus Shiite-Sunni conflict seems to be a great idea for Riyadh, enthusiastically seconded by its protector and close ally, Israel. </p> <p>With these in mind, the blitz boys of so many Arab and Western states are attacking and destroying Yemen’s lifelines for all the criminal reasons. This unqualified alliance stems from motives for regional domination and more. They now want to split Yemen, with no intention to comply with International Humanitarian Law, let alone take feasible measures to minimize harm to civilians and end the conflict</p> <p><span><a href="https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980526001181">https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980526001181</a></span></p> <p>My remark: An Iranian viewpoint.</p> <p>(* B K P)</p> <p><span>Der Kurswechsel der Emirate im Jemen</span></p> <p>Lange standen die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate im Jemen-Krieg an der Seite Saudi-Arabiens, um die Huthis zu bekämpfen. Doch damit ist jetzt Schluss. Denn die Emirate verfolgen andere Ziele.</p> <p>Die Sorge vor einem Bürgerkrieg im Krieg wächst.</p> <p>Die Kämpfe offenbaren nicht nur die Möglichkeit einer Spaltung des Jemen, sondern gleichzeitig auch Risse innerhalb der von Saudi-Arabien geführten Militärkoalition. Denn während Saudi-Arabien immer noch Hadis Regierung im Kampf gegen die Huthis unterstützt, stehen die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate (VAE) hinter den Separatisten und dem Übergangsrat des Südens (STC).</p> <p>In einem Treffen mit dem saudischen Kronprinzen Mohammed bin Salman versuchte der starke Mann aus den Emiraten, Mohammed bin Zayed, zwar die Wogen zu glätten. Beide riefen die verschiedenen Konfliktparteien dazu auf, miteinander zu sprechen. Noch ist nicht klar, worauf man sich in Aden verständigen wird. Jedoch vermied Mohammed bin Zayed eine ausdrückliche Aufforderung an den Befehlshaber der Separatisten, Aidarus al Zubaidi, sich aus der Stadt zurückzuziehen.</p> <p>Eigentlich dürfte das Vorgehen der Emirate keine Überraschung für die regionale Großmacht Saudi-Arabien sein. Auch wenn die Emirate einst eng an der Seite Riads standen, hatten sie bereits vor dem Coup der von ihnen unterstützen Separatisten in Aden ihren Rückzug aus dem Jemen angekündigt.</p> <p>"Saudi-Arabien und die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate hatten im Jemen-Krieg schon immer unterschiedliche Ziele", sagt Golfstaaten-Experte Guido Steinberg von der Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik in Berlin. Auch wenn beide die Huthis schlagen wollten, habe das für Saudi-Arabien immer eine größere Priorität gehabt, weil sie vom Iran Unterstützung erhielten, erklärt er. Außerdem hätten die Saudi-Araber das Bündnis mit "Islah", einer Mischung aus Milizen und den Muslimbrüdern, gesucht. "Für die Emirate war das ein rotes Tuch, weil der Kampf gegen die Muslimbrüder in der Region für sie wichtiger ist als der Kampf gegen den Iran." Es sei eine der wichtigsten Grundlinien in der gesamten Region, die Muslimbrüder als Alternative zu autoritären Regimen zu bekämpfen.</p> <p>Unter Mohammed bin Salman hat sich der Anti-Teheran-Kurs allerdings weiter verstärkt. </p> <p>Steinberg sieht daher auch noch einen anderen Grund für das Vorgehen der Emirate im Jemen: "Für die Emirate hat es immer eine Rolle gespielt, die Kontrolle über wichtige Häfen im Süden zu gewinnen." Und die haben sie.

Did Iran or the poor Yemen suffering a score of internal problems, indeed attack Saudi Arabia? Did the Houthis indeed create a so-called Arab coalition which has consistently bombed the Saudi cities and villages killing the civilians? By no means. It was the Saudis, namely the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud</p> <p>Thus, the West, which has been doing good business on the Yemen blood, will go on with its impudent demagogical statements that Iran, not Saudi Arabia, is responsible for the Yemen tragedy. Even more so, since Riyadh is buying arms amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars from the US alone, thus supporting the American military and industrial complex and giving Donald Trump a chance to create new jobs in the US.

The armed group abducted her son in late December 2014, two months after the September coup.</p> <p>Speaking of her determination to continue protesting, she says, “Every time I hear about the horrors experienced by the abductees under Houthi captivity, especially when a detainee is released in a prisoner swap bearing signs of torture, it pains me to imagine my son meeting the same fate.”</p> <p>For more than two years, the Mothers of Abductees Association has been organizing sit-ins and protests in Sana’a. During this time, it has held 108 protests, and is the most prominent voice that speaks today for the abducted. Alongside its mobilization work, the association is also involved in other activities, including monitoring and documenting violations by the Houthis against civilians.</p> <p>The Mothers of Abductees Association is a new addition to the record of Yemeni women who remain marginalized but are able to stand together courageously. Collectively they make their presence felt and vigorously fight for the release of their sons, many of whom have been detained by the Houthis without charge.</p> <p>In 2017, according to Amat al-Salam al-Haj, president of the association, they identified 5,347 cases of abduction and 721 cases of enforced disappearance across prisons in the north and south of the country. The abductees were subjected to brutal torture in captivity, which led to the death of more than 100 detainees, many whom suffered permanent disabilities following their release.</p> <p>Umm Mohammad is fearful for her son and spends many of her nights without sleep. Her fear is heightened when contact from her son is completely cut off, and she does not know whether he is alive or dead, healthy or ill, well-fed or hungry.</p> <p><span><a href="https://almadaniyamag.com/2018/06/26/2018-6-27-the-mothers-of-abductees-association-a-model-of-the-courage-of-yemeni-women/">https://almadaniyamag.com/2018/06/26/2018-6-27-the-mothers-of-abductees-association-a-model-of-the-courage-of-yemeni-women/</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp3 Humanitäre Lage / Humanitarian situation</span></h2> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p>Flow Monitoring Points | Migrant Arrivals and Yemeni Returns from Saudi Arabia, July 2019</p> <p>Displacement Tracking in Yemen includes the monitoring of key migrant and return locations on Yemen's northern border with Saudi Arabia and southern coastal border.

The Yemeni people face high rates of malnutrition, cholera outbreaks and lack of medical supplies.</p> <p>Firstly, because medical facilities in Yemen are lacking essential materials such as clean water, diseases that are easily treatable are deadly. About 80 per cent of the Yemeni population is malnourished, forced to drink unclean water and cannot afford health care, making them more vulnerable to diphtheria, cholera and other diseases. The current war has destroyed infrastructure and health care in Yemen.</p> <p>Fact 2: Aerial bombardment hospitals in Yemen have been repeatedly destroyed and it is difficult for hospitals to provide electricity and running water permanently in light of airstrikes. The ongoing fighting did not allow the damage to medical structures to be addressed in order to address the needs of the Yemeni people. Families are often asked to take the sick and wounded to hospitals without the help of ambulances. All 22 governorates of Yemen are affected by the fighting.</p> <p>Fact 3: In less than a year of fighting in Yemen, airstrikes hit 39 hospitals. Troops on both sides of the conflict blocked access to medicines and medical supplies from abroad, preventing the flow of medicines needed to treat diseases, such as cholera. This puts the Yemeni people, especially children, at risk; 144 children die every day from curable diseases and more than one million children are starving or malnourished.</p> <p>Fact 4: Rural facilities, such as those in the northern highlands, cannot provide enough food for patients. Lack of food in many hospitals prevents successful treatment of malnutrition.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.uprising.today/ten-facts-about-healthcare-in-yemen/">https://www.uprising.today/ten-facts-about-healthcare-in-yemen/</a></span></p> <p><span>(A H)</span></p> <p>A patient died while his family was carrying him on their shoulders along bumpy mountain roads from the villages under siege in Hebshi mountain to reach the hospitals in Taiz city.</p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1162063924725989381">https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1162063924725989381</a></span></p> <p><span>(A H)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/HndOrg">Human Needs Deve-HND: </a></span><span>We yesterday created our fundraising link to enable our donors continue their supporting to Yemen and its needy people.

Eine besonders brisante Rolle spielen die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate.</p> <p>„Die Regierung des Jemen müsse Aden nun unverzüglich verlassen und die Macht an den Südlichen Übergangsrat übergeben“, fordert Ratsmitglied Mansour Saleh.</p> <p>Die Separatisten verabscheuen im Grunde alles, was aus dem Norden kommt, die Hadi-Regierung, die Islah-Partei wie auch die Huthi-Rebellen. Unterstützt werden die Separatisten von den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten, die ein strategisches Interesse am Südjemen haben. Die Emirate wollen dort die Handelsrouten vor der Küste sichern, sie wollen den ungehinderten Zugang zum Hafen von Aden und haben es vermutlich auch auf den Reichtum an Bodenschätzen abgesehen.</p> <p>Was die Emirate aber besonders mit den Separatisten verbindet, ist die Abneigung gegen die islamistische Islah-Partei. </p> <p>Die Islah-Partei ist allerdings ein Partner Saudi-Arabiens beim Kampf gegen die Huthi-Aufständischen, während die Saudis die Separatisten neuerdings wieder bekämpfen. Gleichzeitig wird einmal mehr deutlich, dass Saudi-Arabien und die Emirate verschiedene Wege im Jemen gehen. Das Zweckbündnis gegen die Houthis bröckelt. Das sei das Brisante an der neuen Situation, meint der Völkerrechtsexperte Adel al-Masani im Programm des Fernsehsenders Aljazeera.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/jemen-konflikt-saudi-arabien-entgleitet-die-kontrolle.799.de.html?dram:article_id=456588">https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/jemen-konflikt-saudi-arabien-entgleitet-die-kontrolle.799.de.html?dram:article_id=456588</a> und als Audio. <a href="https://www.ardaudiothek.de/eine-welt/jemen-konflikt-saudi-arabien-entgleitet-die-kontrolle/66005574">https://www.ardaudiothek.de/eine-welt/jemen-konflikt-saudi-arabien-entgleitet-die-kontrolle/66005574</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>New twist in Yemen conflict as STC takes over Aden</p> <p>While the STC is unlikely to forego its advances in Aden, it is also unlikely to pursue independence in the short term, relying instead on negotiations to resolve the crisis.</p> <p>Analysts noted that the STC has significant leverage but warned that al-Islah remains a threat.</p> <p>“A return to a united Yemen is no longer possible. At the same time, it is impossible to revive a country that was once called South Yemen and which at one point was going by the name of the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen,” said Khairallah Khairallah, an analyst and author on Yemeni politics.</p> <p>“The recent events at Aden, not only serve to expose the weakness of the al-Islah backed legitimacy camp but also usher a turning point that can ultimately to Aden possibly regaining some of its past glory by providing the necessary services and security for its people.”</p> <p>“This is the real challenge for the Southern Transitional Council, not that of reviving a defunct state in the south going back to the pre-unification era,” he added. </p> <p>Iraqi writer Ali Sarraf said that while “Yemenis are united around their land, history, culture and economy,” there has been “damage done by the northern political parties, notably al-Islah, to Yemen’s national unity.”</p> <p>“Members of al-Islah party… can only view today’s Saudi Arabia as an enemy,” Sarraf added. “However, southerners could turn out being a better ally if they consider the need for Riyadh to support them in their fight against two evils: the Iran-backed Houthis and failed tribalism that has long been upheld by Islamists.”</p> <p>The Arab coalition eyes the development of consensus to having joint security forces maintain security in Aden, under the supervision of the Arab coalition, and on removing from Aden brigades and other military units that are not needed for Aden’s security.</p> <p>Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have displayed a united front on Yemen, playing down reports of divisions that analysts say could weaken their joint campaign against Iran-linked rebels – by Khairallah Khairallah</p> <p><span><a

news site.</span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>South Yemen Is Already Functionally Independent Even If It's Not Recognized As Such</p> <p>It was bound to happen sooner than later, but the Southern Transitional Council (STC) once again liberated the former South Yemeni capital of Aden from the Saudi-backed Islah Islamists and Hadi's forces for the second time <span><a href="https://eurasiafuture.com/2018/01/30/welcome-back-map-south-yemen/">since January 2018</a></span>, though this time they're not willing to return to the status quo ante bellum but are bargaining hard for the coalition's recognition of their functional independence. </p> <p>It should be noted that the STC is a secular organization that has an entirely different worldview than Islah, which explains the never-ending tension between them since the GCC-organized coalition unnaturally brought these ideologically contradictory groups together in the shared short-term interest of stopping the Ansar Allah's rapid advance southward and pushing them as far back north as possible. </p> <p>Iranian Intrigue</p> <p>Being once again in control of Aden but with the STC this time unwilling to cede power except potentially to the allied Security Belt Forces (SBF) or Aden Police (according to Alnoud in the previously cited interview), the tipping point might have finally been passed whereby the coalition is forced by necessity to recognize South Yemen's functional independence if it hopes to continue the war.</p> <p>Time To Act</p> <p>With the Ansar Allah being politically supported by Iran and Islah being suspected of indirect connections to it, the STC might have felt like a conspiracy was brewing that could end its separatist plans one way or another in the future, hence the pressing need to remove this threat from the territory of their formerly independent state as soon as possible before the situation got out of control.</p> <p>The Six Steps Towards Independence</p> <p>In practical terms, this means being recognized by the UN as a legitimate party to the conflict and thus being assured a role in the ongoing negotiations to end it, after which they can then proceed according to the phased plan that the author suggested in his December 2017 policy proposal about how "<span><a href="https://orientalreview.org/2017/12/08/south-yemen-will-regain-independence-follows-six-steps/">South Yemen Will Regain Independence If It Follows These Six Steps</a></span>", beginning with an

Road</a></span>.</p> <p>Concluding Thoughts</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, the Ansar Allah, and Iran all share one goal in common and that's to prevent the restoration of South Yemen's statehood, but none of them are in a position to stop the seemingly inevitable and can only realistically slow it down if anything after all that just recently transpired. – by Andrew Korybko</p> <p><span><a

Now they’re coming to the surface,” Porter said.</p> <p>“I think the STC is in a much stronger position,” said Elisabeth Kendall, a senior research fellow in Arabic and Islamic Studies at Pembroke College, Oxford, and an expert on Yemen.</p> <p>“They’ve managed to exert themselves with very little tangible pushback so far,” she said.</p> <p>“The way a legitimate government looks is going to have to change substantially once this conflict comes to an end,” Porter said.</p> <p>Even if the Saudi government pushes Hadi to negotiate with the STC, the Yemeni president’s influence is in decline.</p> <p>“The power lies with the members of the Coalition. The big question is how are the UAE and Saudi Arabia going to square this circle when they have very different interests in Yemen yet they are nominally on the same side,” Porter said.</p> <p>The Saudi government does not want the coalition to collapse, but it also has a vested interest in preventing southern secession, Kendall suggested, because that could enable the Houthis to form a Shia state on their southern border.</p> <p>And while the Saudi-led coalition has tolerated Yemen’s Islah movement’s support for the Hadi government, the STC accuses them of being agents of the Muslim Brotherhood — a charge the UAE supports.</p> <p>“I would say the primary enemy for the UAE is not the Houthis in Yemen, but Islah,” Porter said.</p> <p>The UAE is “not just interested in” a move against Islah in Yemen, “that is one of their primary goals,” Porter said.</p> <p>“If the STC, the Security Belt forces and the elite forces start to move to take control, let’s say, places in the east, such as al-Mahrah,” where Saudi Arabia has a military presence, “then I think there will have to be some kind of [Saudi] military force retaliation,” Kendall explained.</p> <p>“That could spark a war,” Kendall said</p> <p>Yemen’s south is a patchwork of tribal allegiances and groups, some of them separatists, but not necessarily loyal to the STC.</p> <p>“Others are nominally allied with Hadi or have federal representation and don’t necessarily want full secession,” Porter said. The governor of al-Mahrah reaffirmed loyalty to the Hadi government earlier this week.</p> <p>The Emirati draw down and signs of the Saudi government’s exhaustion with the war against the Houthis “really does indicate that some kind of negotiated settlement must be the way forward now,” Kendall said.</p> <p>“And that Saudi can’t just bomb its way to victory at this point.” – by Jared Szuba</p> <p><span><a href="https://thedefensepost.com/2019/08/15/yemen-southern-transitional-council-aden/">https://thedefensepost.com/2019/08/15/yemen-southern-transitional-council-aden/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Saudi Arabia and the civil war within Yemen’s civil war</p> <p>The Hadi government has lost its capital and the south’s largest port.

the withdrawal of the STC forces that headed back towards their previous sites.</p> <p>In a brief statement posted on Twitter, Yemen's Information Minister Muammar Iryani confirmed that forces of the presidential troops had received a number of government offices and institutions after the STC's withdrawal.</p> <p>The Yemeni minister also highly lauded the role of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in containing the violent incidents in Aden.</p> <p>The Yemeni minister said that the procedures for handing over the building of the country's Ministry of Interior and the Aden's oil refinery to the presidential guard forces are being discussed under the supervision of the Saudi-led coalition.</p> <p>He concluded by calling for "uniting all national efforts towards the main battle of the Yemenis and not to engage inside battles, so as to ensure the restoration of the state and bring down the coup of the Iranian-backed Houthi militia."</p> <p>On the other side, the spokesman for the Aden-based STC Nizar Haitham, said what happened in Aden "is not a withdrawal in its true sense, but there were some mutual understandings with the Arab coalition forces for the good of the citizens."</p> <p>"The understandings led to the neutralization of some facilities, including the Central Bank of Yemen, the Judicial Compound, and other institutions tasked with offering services in order to normalize life and return it to its natural course," he added.</p> <p>Regarding the country's presidential palace, Haitham said that the palace was "not a target for us from the beginning ... but we were able to secure it from the terrorist elements, and was handed over earlier this week to the leadership of the Saudi-led Arab coalition."</p> <p>However, the STC's spokesman denied any discussion about withdrawal from the military bases that have been seized from the government forces during the four-day-long street fighting in Aden.</p> <p>He noted that vacating the military bases seized by the STC forces may be discussed during the upcoming Saudi-brokered reconciliation talks between the two warring rivals in Riyadh.</p> <p>Yasser Yafai, an Aden-based political observer, told Xinhua that the STC's recent moves came within the framework of mutual understandings and keenness not to disrupt the interests of citizens and in response to coalition's calls.</p> <p>He said that the STC immediately rushed to normalize the situation in Aden after the latest violent events forced many institutions to shut down.</p> <p>"Some vital government facilities were reopened in coordination with the Arab coalition that formed joint security units to protect those facilities so that they could operate and not hinder the interests of citizens," he added.</p> <p><span><a

will be a joint technical committee to manage service facilities, such as the Central Bank, the hospital and the judicial complex, these facilities are considered services for citizens and therefore there is no dispute about them."</p> <p>He continued: "The process of securing these sites will be joint under the direct supervision of the leadership of the Saudi-led coalition to ensure that there

It also appreciates the response by the transitional council in Aden to the call of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to cease fire and favor wisdom and the advocate for the primacy of interests of the Yemeni people and not to harm them or prejudice to public and private property as it appreciates kicking off today's withdrawal of their troops and combating elements and returning to their former positions before the recent events, with handing over the headquarters of the Yemeni government under the Coalition' supervision.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=1959159">https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=1959159</a></span></p> <p>Comment: <span>New statement from official </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Saudi?src=hashtag_click">#Saudi</a></span><span> press agency welcomes the start of withdrawal of southern forces from positions seized in </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Aden?src=hashtag_click">#Aden</a></span><span> Note it's just the "start".

The southern cause is not a source of variance for anyone. It is the result of northern Yemeni occupation for the southern state. the southern cause is the real key for any peace process in Yemen. This is confirmed by all northern Yemeni powers in the authority, opposition and even movements. There will be no peace unless the southern cause is resolved”. </p> <p><span><a href="https://en.smanews.org/al-khabji-no-conflict-between-uae-and-saudi-arabia-about-aden-events">https://en.smanews.org/al-khabji-no-conflict-between-uae-and-saudi-arabia-about-aden-events</a></span></p> <p>My comment: This is separatist propaganda.

Southerners need to be given the power to govern themselves and Southerners need to be engaged as an equal partner in the peace process."<br /> He said the only way out of the stand-off was for all elements of the Islamist Islah party - one of the backbones of Hadi's government - to be ousted from all positions of influence along with any northern politicians.<br /> "That would be a very good start if Islah was removed from the whole of the south and allow southerners to govern themselves," he said. "We consider the government was infiltrated or controlled by the Islah."<br /> One possible way out, Alnoud said, would be to hand over responsibility for security of barracks to the Security Belt, the military wing of STC, or Aden Police.<br /> Alnoud said the Aden developments were the most significant turning point in Yemen for years and that southerners would no longer accept being sidelined.<br /> "The Saudis need to make a decision: do they want to win the war against the Houthis?

The military escalation by government troops resulted in the tragic loss of civilian lives and only further compounded the humanitarian suffering of our people. As the STC have articulated in public and in private to our international allies, and UN Special Envoy Mr Martin Griffiths, the only solution to ensure the de-escalation holds and to secure a sustainable solution to the crisis, is a political one.</p> <p>But this political solution requires a step change in the international approach we have witnessed to date. The facts on the ground have changed. This necessitates an acceptance by the international community of the new realities stemming from long-held grievances of the South and gross violations since the war of 1994 against the South. Therefore, we call for a much urgently needed diplomatic approach that takes this into consideration. All of the previous initiatives to have been short sighted and consciously ignored the South and the legitimate needs of our people.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, the STC reaffirms its full commitment to the UN-led political track as a priority, and in this regard we welcome the efforts of our brothers in Saudi Arabia to initiate a genuine and constructive dialogue. We are prepared to participate in any kind of discussion that safeguards the needs of the South and ensures the STC’s direct role in the decision making process. As we have reiterated previously, the best way of securing a lasting political deal is through an inclusive political track under the auspices of the UN that ensures the inclusion of the Southern issue in the agenda of any future consultations.</p> <p>For too long the South has faced a brutal marginalisation campaign. </p> <p><span><a href="https://stc-eu.org/en/stc-only-an-inclusive-un-led-political-solution-to-address-south-yemen-crisis/">https://stc-eu.org/en/stc-only-an-inclusive-un-led-political-solution-to-address-south-yemen-crisis/</a></span></p> <p>(* A P)</p> <p>Aug. 11: Speech by Aidaros Al-Zubaydi, President of the Southern Transitional Council</p> <p>After we have shown you the truth of what happened, the international and regional organizations in Aden can be an eyewitness to the facts of what transpired, we would like to emphasize the following points.</p> <ol><li>Our readiness to work responsibly with the leadership of the Arab Alliance, led by Saudi Arabia, in managing this crisis and its consequences in order to enhance the cohesion of the social fabric.</li> <li>We reiterate our firm position to stand fully with the Arab coalition to fight Iranian expansion in the region led by Saudi Arabia.</li> <li>We renew our confidence in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which we hope and attach the hopes and aspirations of our people and declare our readiness to work with them and through them, as a loyal ally that is strong and had already proven on the ground what others failed to do for five years except through lies.</li> </ol><p><span><a href="https://stc-eu.org/en/speech-by-aidaros-al-zubaydi/">https://stc-eu.org/en/speech-by-aidaros-al-zubaydi/</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp7 UNO und Friedensgespräche / UN and peace talks</span></h2> <p>(* B P)</p> <p>Time For New UN Approach On Yemen – OpEd</p> <p>The United Nations is in dire need of making a drastic adjustment in its approach toward the conflict in Yemen, otherwise the world organization has little chance of causing a much-needed breakthrough in this stalemated war that has already produced the world’s most catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Despite the valiant efforts of the current UN Envoy for Yemen, Mr. Martin Griffiths, the overall UN approach toward Yemen, which consists of the two prongs of humanitarian assistance and political mediation, is unfortunately riddled with problems, which need to be fixed immediately for the sake of millions of suffering civilians in Yemen, as well as regional stability.</p> <p>Fact of the matter is that Yemen has been in a state of de facto partition for the past five years and the UN’s call for the restoration of government of national unity, which has become a shell without content, is seriously delusional and akin to holding onto a false narrative — that simply does not serve the purpose of peace-making in Yemen.</p> <p>Yemen’s future may lie like the UAE, a confederate, rather than a federal system and or two Yemen, which is problematic since the south is resource-rich and, case in point, its oil and gas income belongs to all the Yemen people. Eventually a feasible formula for distribution of national income must be found, perhaps drawing lessons from the post-invasion Iraq, which is itself a work-in-progress. </p> <p>Another problem with UN’s approach is that Griffiths is desperately trying to insulate Yemen from the brewing regional conflict involving Iran on the one hand and the US and its regional allied led by Saudi Arabia on the other, which is futile and ignores the fact that Yemen’s integration in the Iran-Saudi cold war is a <em>fait accompli</em>. </p> <p>The UN Security Council must therefore step forward by reiterating its commitment to Yemen’s territorial integrity and imposing sanctions on those seeking Yemen’s break-up. Unless such adjustments above-mentioned are realized, UN will remain a part of the solution as well as problems in Yemen, its credibility mortgaged to the perception that it has been biased and so far failed to act as a neutral mediator.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.eurasiareview.com/17082019-time-for-new-un-approach-on-yemen-oped/">https://www.eurasiareview.com/17082019-time-for-new-un-approach-on-yemen-oped/</a></span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p><span>Dreiertreffen in Teheran zu Jemenkrise</span></p> <p> In Iran sind heute Delegationen der Ansarollh-Bewegung in Jemen, der Islamischen Republik Iran sowie Botschafter und Vertreter von vier EU-Ländern, Großbritannien, Frankreich, Deutschland und Italien, zusammengekommen, um über einen Ausweg aus der politischen Krise zu beraten.</p> <p><span><a href="http://parstoday.com/de/news/iran-i48564-dreiertreffen_in_teheran_zu_jemenkrise">http://parstoday.com/de/news/iran-i48564-dreiertreffen_in_teheran_zu_jemenkrise</a></span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>Iran Hosts Yemeni, European Meeting to End Saudi-Led War</p> <p>A trilateral meeting was held among Iran, Yemen's Ansarullah movement and the four European states of Britain, France, Germany and Italy in Tehran on Saturday to discuss ways to end the devastating war in Yemen and send immediate humanitarian aid to the country.</p> <p>Senior Assistant to the Iranian foreign minister for Political Affairs Ali Asqar Khaji headed Iran's delegation while the Yemeni and European delegations were led by Ansaruallah Spokesman Mohammed Abdul Salam and the British, French, German and Italian envoys to Tehran, respectively.</p> <p>During the meeting, the participants explained about their governments' views about the political, field and humanitarian situation in Yemen, expressing regret over the continued critical conditions in the country after thousands of Yemeni people were killed and wounded and different infrastructures in the country were destroyed in the Saudi-led war.</p> <p>They also underscored the need for an immediate end to the war and finding of a political solution to the crisis in Yemen, and called for the dispatch of humanitarian aid to the country as soon as possible.</p> <p>Meantime, the delegations participating in the meeting emphasized full implementation of the Stockholm agreements, describing it as a prelude to the final settlement of the political crisis in Yemen.</p> <p><span><a href="https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980526000984">https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980526000984</a></span></p> <p><span>and also </span><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=8323">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=8323</a></span></p> <p><span>Photos: </span><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/posts/2436521249734224">https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/posts/2436521249734224</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp8 Saudi-Arabien / Saudi Arabia</span></h2> <p><span>Siehe / Look at cp1</span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Ethiopians face beatings and bullets as Saudi ‘deportation machine’ cranks up</p> <p>Saudi Arabia denies claims that staff at detention facilities treat violent abuse of undocumented migrants ‘like a sport’</p> <p>Tayib is one of roughly <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/KSA%20Factsheet_March%202019_Regional%20Data%20Hub.pdf">10,000</a></span> Ethiopians deported every month from Saudi Arabia since 2017, when authorities there stepped up a hardline campaign to remove undocumented immigrants.

The principles of multilateralism and international law must be adhered to. It seems almost astounding that one has to appeal for such obvious basic norms.</p> <p>Fortunately, Russia has presented a roadmap for implementing a security concept in the vital waterway based on the above principles.</p> <p>Russia’s deputy envoy to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyansky, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yij00OWzF7M&amp;feature=youtu.be">outlined</a> a possible international coalition to provide security for commercial shipping through the strategically important Persian Gulf. The narrow outlet accounts for up to 30 per cent of all globally shipped oil on a daily basis. Virtually every nation has a stake in the safe passage of tankers. Any disruption would have huge negative consequences for the world economy, impacting all nations.</p> <p>The Russian proposal, which has been submitted to the UN Security Council, is currently being considered by various parties. Crucially, the security concept put forward by Moscow relies on the participation of the Gulf nations, including Iran. Rather than being led by an outside power, the Russian proposal envisages a region-led effort.</p> <p>This multilateral arrangement for cooperation between nations is solidly within the principles of the UN Charter and international law. Potentially, it can build trust and positive relations, and thereby reduce the climate of tensions and uncertainty which have intensified over recent months, primarily between the United States and Iran.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2019/08/16/russias-sound-proposal-for-gulf-peace/">https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2019/08/16/russias-sound-proposal-for-gulf-peace/</a></span> = <span><a href="https://southfront.org/russias-sound-proposal-for-gulf-peace/">https://southfront.org/russias-sound-proposal-for-gulf-peace/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Kriegsspiele an der Straße von Hormus</p> <p>Es ist beachtlich, mit welcher Leichtigkeit in diesen Tagen wieder militärische Szenarien durchdacht und gefordert werden. Jüngstes Beispiel ist der Konflikt um die Straße von Hormus. Die Meerenge, die den Persischen Golf mit dem Golf von Oman verbindet, ist ein bedeutendes Nadelöhr für den internationalen Handel. Insbesondere große Teile des saudi-arabischen Erdöls müssen die Enge passieren und dafür auch Hoheitsgewässer des Iran durchqueren.<br /> Dieser hatte im Juli den britischen Tanker „Stena Impero“ festgesetzt, nachdem Großbritannien vor Gibraltar den iranischen Tanker „Grace 1“ gestoppt hatte. Seit dieser Eskalation versuchen die USA unter dem Vorwand des Schutzes der internationalen Handelsschifffahrt eine Militärallianz gegen den Iran aufzubauen. Maßgeblich vorangetrieben wird dieses Unterfangen von einem der größten Kriegstreiber der US-Administration, dem nationalen Sicherheitsberater John Bolton. Er möchte lieber heute als morgen einen Krieg gegen den Iran beginnen, trifft jedoch noch auf Zweifler unter anderem im US-Verteidigungsministerium.<br /> Auch in Europa wird offen über militärische Missionen debattiert. </p> <p><span><a href="https://diefreiheitsliebe.de/politik/meinungsstark-politik/kriegsspiele-an-der-strasse-von-hormus/">https://diefreiheitsliebe.de/politik/meinungsstark-politik/kriegsspiele-an-der-strasse-von-hormus/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Film: Mohssen Massarrat: Kann der Irankrieg noch verhindert werden?</p> <p>In einem Gespräch mit Sabine Kebir erläutert der Politik- und Wirtschaftswissenschaftler Prof. Mohssen Massarrat die Positionen der verschiedenen, potentiell an einem Krieg um die Macht im Persischen Golf beteiligten Länder.<br /> Die USA möchten ihre über die eigene Rüstungsindustrie, den Finanzsektor und die Kontrolle der fossilen Energien bestehende Hegemonie über die Welt für weitere Jahrzehnte sichern. Sie meinen, dass sie ganz besonders im Mittleren Osten gefährdet ist, wo der Iran seine Position im letzten Jahrzehnt stärken konnte. Ob ein Militärschlag zielführend wäre oder doch zu riskant – darüber sind sich zwei politische Lager nicht einig, die Frage spaltet auch die beiden große Parteien selber. Es gelingt aber dem von Trumps Sicherheitschef John Bolton angeführten, zum Krieg treibenden Lager, immer wieder Anlässe zu schaffen, die den Iran provozieren sollen. Das andere Lager, das eher auf verschärfte Wirtschaftssanktionen setzt, fürchtet zu recht, dass der Krieg ein asymmetrischer wird und gegen hunderttausende, in der Golfregion stationierte amerikanische Soldaten von iranischen Milizen und Revolutionsgarden Selbstmordattentate durchgeführt würden. US-Truppen sind ja nicht nur in den südlichen Anrainerstaaten des Golfs stationiert, sondern auch im Irak und in Syrien. Hinzu kommt, dass die Hisbollah im Libanon über ca. hunderttausend iranische Raketen verfügt, die in wenigen Minuten Tel Aviv treffen könnten – ein „Faustpfand“, das der Iran gegen Israels Atombomben in Stellung gebracht hat.<br /> Nicht nur, weil Europa sich als Schutzmacht Israels versteht, sondern auch selbst ungleich stärker von den Auswirkungen eines weiteren Kriegs im Mittleren Osten betroffen wäre, zögert es, den USA Unterstützung zu gewähren. Um so beunruhigender ist, dass es Bolton gelungen ist, Großbritannien zum Kapern eines iranischen Tankers in der Straße von Gibraltar zu bewegen, worauf der Iran mit dem Kapern eines britischen Schiffs reagiert hat. Massarrat sieht eine gefährliche Entwicklung kommen, wenn die freie Schifffahrt künftig nicht mehr durch eine auf dem Völkerrecht basierende Konvention gesichert wird, sondern durch Kriegsschiffe.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4HE_2QdGwk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4HE_2QdGwk</a></span></p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p>USA wollen Supertanker "Grace 1" beschlagnahmen</p> <p>Gerade erst hat ein britisches Gericht den mit iranischem Öl beladenen Supertanker bei Gibraltar freigegeben – jetzt verfügt ein US-Gericht die Beschlagnahmung.</p> <p>Im Konflikt um den mit iranischem Öl beladenen Supertanker "Grace 1" hat ein Bundesgericht in Washington die Beschlagnahmung des vor Gibraltar liegenden Schiffes verfügt.

Auch ein Regierungssprecher konnte dazu keine Auskunft geben.</p> <p>Mit der Entscheidung wächst die Hoffnung auf eine Deeskalation in dem schwelenden Konflikt zwischen dem Iran und mehreren westlichen Ländern, darunter den USA und Großbritannien.</p> <p>In letzter Minute versuchten die USA, das Schiff am Auslaufen zu hindern. Die Regierung Gibraltars teilte mit, das US-Justizministerium habe beantragt, den Tanker wegen einer Reihe von Vorwürfen zu beschlagnahmen. Eine gerichtliche Prüfung dessen stehe noch aus. Was das konkret für den Tanker bedeutet, ist noch unklar.</p> <p>Der Iran bestätigte die Freigabe des Schiffes. Der Tanker werde schon bald Gibraltar verlassen, twitterte Irans Botschafter in London, Hamid Baeidinedschad. Das Ende «der illegalen Festsetzung» des Schiffs sei das Ergebnis intensiver Verhandlungen des iranischen Außenministeriums mit der britischen Seite in den vergangenen Wochen. Die Entscheidung des Gerichts in Gibraltar sei auch eine «demütigende Niederlage» für die USA, die noch am Vormittag die Freigabe des Tankers hätten verhindern wollen.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.radioessen.de/artikel/gibraltar-will-supertanker-grace-1-freigeben-295962.html">https://www.radioessen.de/artikel/gibraltar-will-supertanker-grace-1-freigeben-295962.html</a> = <a href="https://www.radioemscherlippe.de/artikel/gibraltar-will-supertanker-grace-1-freigeben-295962.html">https://www.radioemscherlippe.de/artikel/gibraltar-will-supertanker-grace-1-freigeben-295962.html</a></span></p> <p><span>Mein Kommentar: Die USA lassen die Hosen runter.

Two weeks later, Iran seized a British ship in the Gulf, in what was widely regarded as a tit-for-tat operation.</p> <p>As tensions increased, the two sides conducted delicate negotiations in London. "Gibraltar has taken a very careful approach to the detention of Grace 1," Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo told CNN "We only acted in July when we had evidence that the cargo aboard the vessel was going to Syria."</p> <p>"What we found aboard the vessel has confirmed the view that we took was the correct view. We have only released the vessel... when we have been convinced that the vessel is not now going to Syria," he added.</p> <p>A last-minute intervention by the US threatened to scupper the deal to release the Grace 1. In a court hearing Thursday morning, instead of announcing the release of the tanker, the Gibraltar attorney general's lawyer Joseph Triay said the US Department of Justice had applied to extend its seizure. The basis of Washington's legal efforts was unclear Thursday. The State Department referred CNN to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment.</p> <p>The court adjourned until later Thursday afternoon, when the release of the Grace 1 was confirmed.</p> <p>Picardo told CNN that Gibraltar was still looking at the request from the US and "making an independent assessment" of it. That review had not been completed ahead of Thursday's court hearings "but could of course come at any time before the vessel sails." Picardo declined to elaborate on the basis of the US request to extend the seizure of the vessel.</p> <p>Tehran's ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, said the Grace 1 would leave Gibraltar soon. "The US in a last minute attempt made a futile effort to block the release of the oil tanker and were faced with humiliating defeat. With recent attempts, all necessary preparations and technical issues to release the tanker to an open sea have been arranged and the ship will soon leave Gibraltar," </p> <p><span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/15/middleeast/gibraltar-grace-1-oil-tanker-gbr-intl/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/15/middleeast/gibraltar-grace-1-oil-tanker-gbr-intl/index.html</a></span></p> <p>and</p> <p>(* A P)</p> <p>Iranian Oil Tanker Released Despite US Efforts</p> <p>The decision to release the ship was taken just hours after the Gibraltar government confirmed that the United States launched a separate last-minute legal move to detain the vessel on a number of allegations.</p> <p>But, Chief Justice Anthony Dudley stated that there was no US application currently before the court.</p> <p>“That’s not before me,” he said, adding, “There are no applications in relation to the US letters of request [for mutual legal assistance].”</p> <p>The Gibraltar Chronicle newspaper wrote it is not clear when the ship will sail from Gibraltar or whether the United States will formally apply to the court to detain it before that happens.</p> <p>The Government of Gibraltar also claimed that it has received formal written assurances from the Iranian government that the ship will not discharge its cargo in Syria.</p> <p><span><a href="https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980524000779">https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980524000779</a></span></p> <p>and also <span><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/15/us-makes-last-minute-intervention-try-stop-release-iranian-oil/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/15/us-makes-last-minute-intervention-try-stop-release-iranian-oil/</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/us-iran-oil-tanker-gibraltar-released-gulf-latest-vessel-seized-a9061071.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/us-iran-oil-tanker-gibraltar-released-gulf-latest-vessel-seized-a9061071.html</a></span></p> <p>(A P)</p> <p>U.S. Arranges Secret Talks Between Israel, U.A.E.

It is unlikely the letter contained a message of peace.</p> <p>The Houthis’ task has been facilitated by the seeming complacency of the Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi government in the campaign to stop the Houthis. A “legitimate” government is as legitimate as the tangible actions it undertakes to buttress its international recognition. That wasn’t the case in Yemen despite the support the Hadi government received from the Arab coalition.</p> <p>Recent moves by the Southern Transitional Council in Aden were in great part triggered by the determination to thwart the Houthis’ actions and their manifest alliance with al-Qaeda. The disruptive role of the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated al-Islah party, as an ally of the Hadi government, further wrinkled the effort to stand up to the Houthis.</p> <p>With mounting tensions in the Gulf, especially after the United States imposed sanctions on Iran, the Houthis have been suspected of playing the role of an Iranian surrogate in carrying out destabilising activities, including attacks on Saudi oil installations and airports, essentially through the use of drones.</p> <p><span><a href="https://thearabweekly.com/developments-yemen">https://thearabweekly.com/developments-yemen</a></span></p> <p>(A P)</p> <p><span>The Southern Transitional Council has not just parachuted into the Yemeni crisis</span></p> <p>The STC's move was necessary to prove there are still people who want to protect Aden and prevent the return of the Houthis.</p> <p>Aden, where to? This question becomes relevant after the capture of the city and its most important installations and government buildings by forces of the Southern Transitional Council, which took advantage of the failure of the Yemeni interim government, also known as the “legitimacy camp,” to provide adequate protection to it.</p> <p>The interim government was supposed to be present in the interim capital, Aden, but it has shined only by its flagrant and irresponsible absence from the city, leaving it wide open for the return of the Houthis with the malicious complicity of al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood. Both of the latter would have preferred to see the stagnant status quo in Yemen go on until the day they could strike a deal with the Iran-sponsored Houthis.</p> <p>In this sense, the move by the Southern Transitional Council (STC) in Aden can be seen as aimed at defending the “legitimacy camp,” or whatever was left of it, and a move to prevent the return of the Houthis to the capital of southern Yemen after their expulsion in 2015.</p> <p>What we have learnt from developments in Yemen during the past ten years more than anything else is the great extent of collusion between the Houthis and the Muslim Brotherhood represented by al-Islah party. We cannot ignore Hadi’s tireless pursuit of a power-sharing deal with the Houthis. The man gave up hope for such a deal only after the Houthis had placed him under house arrest.</p> <p>Anyone who has any doubt about this can go back to the circumstances that accompanied the Houthis’ takeover of Sana’a. Hadi had, at the time, refused to defend the city, pretexting that it was the former President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s battle, not his.</p> <p>He did not stop the Houthis at Amran governorate, which was considered the gateway to Sana’a. Worse than that, he hailed the fall of Brigade 310, which was commanded by Brigadier-General Hamid al-Qushaibi. The latter was affiliated with the current vice-president, General Ali Mohsen Saleh al-Ahmar — in other words, the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>Let’s not forget that the Brotherhood played a major role in facilitating the expansion of the Houthis outside of Saada District after they overthrew the Saleh regime in 2011, hoping to take control of the country.</p> <p>The Brotherhood never needed to openly ally itself with the Houthis.

The attack had no impact on oil production or exports, Khalid Bin Abdulaziz Al-Falih, minister of energy, industry and mineral resources said in a statement.<br /> Al-Falih further said that at 6.20 a.m. Saturday, one of the units of Shaybah NGL facility was subject to an explosive-carrying drone attack, resulting in a limited fire that was controlled. There were no casualties.<br /> A statement by Saudi Aramco on its website said, “Saudi Aramco’s response team controlled a limited fire this morning at the Shaybah NGL facility. There were no injuries and no interruptions to Saudi Aramco’s oil operations.”<br /> Meanwhile, Al-Falih stressed in his statement that oil production and exports have not been affected by the terrorist attack.<br /> He asserted the Kingdom’s strong condemnation of the cowardly attack, stressing that this act of sabotage and terror is nothing but an extension of the acts that recently targeted the international oil supply chains, including the oil pipelines in the Kingdom, oil tankers in the Arabian Gulf and others.<br /> This targeting of vital installations, is not targeting the Kingdom alone but the security of global energy supplies as well. </p> <p><span><a href="http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/574789/SAUDI-ARABIA/Houthi-drones-target-Shaybah-oil-field">http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/574789/SAUDI-ARABIA/Houthi-drones-target-Shaybah-oil-field</a></span></p> <p>My comment: The Saudis, bombing Northern Yemen into ruins, better should not lament on “terror” or a “cowardly attack”.</p> <p>And also</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-saudi-oil-attack/houthi-drone-attack-on-saudi-oilfield-causes-gas-fire-output-unaffected-idUSKCN1V705R">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-saudi-oil-attack/houthi-drone-attack-on-saudi-oilfield-causes-gas-fire-output-unaffected-idUSKCN1V705R</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/fire-saudi-oil-field-yemen-rebels-claimed-attacking">https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/fire-saudi-oil-field-yemen-rebels-claimed-attacking</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2019/08/drone-attack-yemen-rebels-sparks-fire-saudi-oil-field-190817132916661.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2019/08/drone-attack-yemen-rebels-sparks-fire-saudi-oil-field-190817132916661.html</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7366877/Yemen-rebel-attack-sparks-fire-Saudi-gas-plant-Aramco.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7366877/Yemen-rebel-attack-sparks-fire-Saudi-gas-plant-Aramco.html</a></span></p> <p>and</p> <p>(* A K pS)</p> <p>Coalition announces interception of a drone</p> <p>The Saudi-led Arab coalition announced on Friday evening the interception and destruction of a drone launched by Houthi militias from Amran, northern Yemen, while the Houthis said the attack disrupted traffic at Abha airport in the southern region of Asir.</p> <p>In a brief statement published by Saudi media on Friday, the coalition said that "the continued attacks by drones carried by Houthi militias reflects their losses and their reality on the ground."</p> <p><span><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/170712">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/170712</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/17/coalition-shoots-down-houthi-militias-drone/">http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/17/coalition-shoots-down-houthi-militias-drone/</a></span> = <span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/13041">http://en.adenpress.news/news/13041</a></span></p> <p>(* A K pH)</p> <p>Using Qasef 2K Drones, Yemeni Air Force Targets Sensitive Military Sites in Abha Airport</p> <p>The Air Force of the Yemeni Army and Popular Committees carried out, on Friday, offensives with a number of Qasef-2K drones targeting Abha International Airport in southern Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Yemeni Armed Forces spokesman said that Air Forces targeted sensitive military sites, hitting them accurately.
