Überblicke für alle, die mit den Ereignissen im Jemen noch nicht vertraut sind, hier:</p> <p>Yemen War: Introductory articles, overviews, for those who are still unfamiliar with the Yemen war here:</p> <p><span><strong><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-einfuehrende-artikel-u-ueberblicke">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-einfuehrende-artikel-u-ueberblicke</a></strong></span></p> <p><em>Neue Artikel / New articles</em></p> <p><strong>(** B H K P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Human Rights Watch: Yemen. Events of 2018</strong></p> <p>Parties to the conflict have exacerbated what the UN has called the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe, including by unlawfully impeding delivery of desperately needed humanitarian aid.</p> <p>The armed conflict has taken a terrible toll on the civilian population. The coalition has conducted scores of indiscriminate and disproportionate airstrikes killing thousands of civilians and hitting civilian objects in violation of the laws of war, using munitions sold by the United States, United Kingdom, and others, including widely banned cluster munitions. Houthi forces have used banned antipersonnel landmines, recruited children, and fired artillery indiscriminately into cities such as Taizz and Aden, killing and wounding civilians, and launched indiscriminate rockets into Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Both sides have harassed, threatened, and attacked Yemeni activists and journalists. Houthi forces, government-affiliated forces, and the UAE and UAE-backed Yemeni forces have arbitrarily detained or forcibly disappeared scores. Houthi forces have taken hostages. Forces in Aden beat, raped, and tortured detained migrants.</p> <p>Despite mounting evidence of violations of international law by the parties to the conflict, efforts toward accountability have been woefully inadequate.</p> <p>Unlawful Airstrikes</p> <p>Since 2015, Human Rights Watch has documented about 90 <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/08/yemen-hiding-behind-coalitions-unlawful-attacks">apparently unlawful coalition airstrikes</a></span>, which have hit <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/12/yemen-coalition-airstrikes-deadly-children">homes</a></span>, markets, hospitals, schools, and mosques. Some of these attacks may amount to war crimes. In 2018, the coalition bombed a wedding, killing 22 people, including 8 children, and in another strike bombed a <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/09/02/yemen-coalition-bus-bombing-apparent-war-crime">bus filled with children</a></span>, killing at least 26 children. Human Rights Watch has identified remnants of US-origin munitions at the site of more than two dozen attacks, including the 2018 attacks on the wedding and the bus.</p> <p>Indiscriminate Artillery Attacks</p> <p>Houthi forces have repeatedly fired artillery indiscriminately into Yemeni cities and launched indiscriminate ballistic missiles <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/02/saudi-arabia/yemen-houthi-missile-attacks-unlawful">into Saudi Arabia</a></span>. Some of these attacks may amount to war crimes. Houthi attacks have struck populated neighborhoods in Yemen, having a particularly devastating impact on <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/09/yemen-artillery-attacks-kill-civilians-taizz">Taizz, Yemen’s third largest city</a></span>.</p> <p>Banned Weapons</p> <p>Landmines have killed and maimed civilians, disrupted civilian life in affected areas, and will pose a threat to civilians long after the conflict ends. Houthi forces <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/20/yemen-houthi-saleh-forces-using-landmines">have used landmines</a></span> in governorates across Yemen, killing and wounding civilians and preventing their return home. </p> <p>Attacks on Civil Society</p> <p>One cost of Yemen’s war has been the closing of space for civil society. Yemeni activists, journalists, lawyers, and rights defenders worry about arrest, harassment, targeted violence, and joining the list of Yemen’s “disappeared.” The risk is greatest when the target of criticism is a party to the conflict, who often retaliate.</p> <p>Blocking and Impeding Humanitarian Access</p> <p>The UN considers Yemen to be the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-mr-mark-4">with 14 million people</a></span>at risk of starvation and repeated outbreaks of deadly diseases like cholera. This crisis is linked to the armed conflict.</p> <p>The Saudi-led coalition’s restrictions on imports have <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/07/yemen-coalition-blockade-imperils-civilians">worsened the dire humanitarian situation</a></span>. </p> <p>Children and Armed Conflict</p> <p>Houthi forces, government and pro-government forces, and other armed groups have used child soldiers.</p> <p>Terrorism and Counterterrorism</p> <p>Both Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State in Yemen have claimed responsibility for suicide and other bombings.</p> <p>Women’s and Girls’ Rights</p> <p>Women activists have played a prominent role during the conflict advocating for better rights protection and protesting mistreatment.</p> <p>Women in Yemen face severe discrimination in law and practice.</p> <p>Accountability</p> <p>None of the warring parties carried out credible investigations into their forces’ alleged laws-of-war violations.</p> <p>Key International Actors</p> <p>Coalition member countries have sought to avoid international legal liability by refusing to provide information on their forces’ role in unlawful attacks. </p> <p>The United States has been a party to the conflict and may be complicit in unlawful coalition attacks in which it took part. </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/yemen">https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/yemen#</a></span></p> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>Yemeni children face starvation as country's humanitarian crisis deepens amid brutal civil war</p> <p>For most babies born into Yemen's ongoing civil war, it is difficult to be distracted from the struggle to stay alive.</p> <p>All they have known is hunger in their lives to date, so they are yet to learn to play.</p> <p>For the lucky youngsters, they have at least made it to a hospital where their malnutrition is being treated.</p> <p>But there are many more that are not as lucky and that's why the aid agencies are asking the world to let them do more.</p> <p>"The Yemeni humanitarian situation is unfortunately the perfect storm of many different humanitarian issues," Kimberly Brown from the British Red Cross told ITV News.</p> <p>"So we see internal displacement, we are seeing people being pushed to the brink of famine and at the risk of moving into famine.</p> <p>"We also see lots of insecurity and the inability for goods to come into the country and for humanitarian workers to be able to operate."</p> <p>Around 24 million people live in Yemen and 80% of population is now in need of humanitarian assistance.</p> <p>More than 14 million are facing starvation.</p> <p>Figures vary on the number of fatalities (photos)</p> <p><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2019-01-28/yemeni-children-face-starvation-as-countrys-humanitarian-crisis-deepens-amid-brutal-civil-war/">https://www.itv.com/news/2019-01-28/yemeni-children-face-starvation-as-countrys-humanitarian-crisis-deepens-amid-brutal-civil-war/</a></p> <p>(* B H P)</p> <p>Film by Oxfam: The people of Yemen are not starving.

"Last month, we had at least 10 children arriving dead in the hospital. Four in ten had clearly traveled for several days, "says Rachel Fletcher, coordinator of MSF Children's Hospital in Taiz.

I have twelve children and fourteen grandsons.</p> <p>My husband has died and I live with two sons and two daughters in the same shaky tent.</p> <p>Two years ago, our village was under attack at night.</p> <p>Some of our neighbours were killed and others were injured, so we did not hesitate to leave our houses that same night.</p> <p>The sounds of fighting surrounded us. The bullets were chasing us while we were fleeing.</p> <p>We did not take anything with us, as just getting to a safe area was our goal. We spent the whole night walking.</p> <p>In the morning we found ourselves in this area, where we had never been before. We decided to stay here until someone came to help us.</p> <p>This area is a graveyard, so people who lived nearby did not stop us from living here. All of us felt happy when we found ourselves in a safe area.”</p> <p><span>“But we were shocked to realise that we did not have anything to help us live and it was a challenge to start our life in the outdoors.</span></p> <p><span>The next day, I started to go to neighbouring villages and people helped me with food.</span></p> <p><span>Ten days later, an organisation gave us tents, so we set up a camp on the graveyard.</span></p> <p><span>I had to resort to begging people to provide us with food. I became the family’s breadwinner.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, I feel sorry to say that begging became our source of income.”</span></p> <p>“In this camp we do not have wheat, flour, sugar, rice or any other basic items, not even firewood.</p> <p>There is no food inside our tent and <a href="https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/yemen-crisis-appeal?c_name=Yemen%20Crisis%20Appeal&amp;c_source=BRC%20Blog&amp;c_medium=Internal&amp;c_creative=Donate%20Landing_Tallabah%20homeless%20and%20hungry%20in%20Yemen&amp;c_code=162198&amp;adg=BRC%20Site">I appeal to the world to help us with food</a>.</p> <p>It is not easy to lose your dignity and resort to begging but if I did not do that, my family would die from hunger.</p> <p>I get barely enough food for one day and sometimes I do not get enough.”</p> <p>“After I get some wheat, I return to cook the meal outdoors. Usually, the bread I make has a lot of dust as the wind blows dust and dirt in this open area.</p> <p>We eat anything even if it is full of dust. Bread and tea mixed with dust is better than nothing.</p> <p>I am struggling to provide enough food for the children but there are a lot of them and there is always a shortage.</p> <p>When I cook, the children fight to eat the bread and they do not wait for me to make them tea.</p> <p>They always go to sleep hungry.</p> <p>Some organisations provide us with food from time to time but that is not enough.”</p> <p>“I think all the time about returning to my house. But people tell me that all roads to our village are blocked because of the ongoing fighting.</p> <p>I think people who flee their homes in any country hope to return to their houses.</p> <p>I am like them.

But it also revealed the extent to which even with better government reporting, the ability to understand the war the United States is waging in Yemen has deteriorated in recent years due to both U.S. policy and the character of the war itself.</p> <p>Despite the overall improvement, in only five of the strikes this past year was date and location information available within CENTCOM’s quarterly press releases and end of year summary of strikes. CENTCOM provided the other information at request to New America and <a href="https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2018/06/yemen-details.php">others</a> tracking the war. Nevertheless, CENTCOM’s willingness to provide detailed information on the timing and location of strikes in response to requests helps clarify the U.S. campaign in Yemen.</p> <p>The newfound transparency only goes so far. The 2018 press release does not address the question of how many ground raids the United States conducted over the past year. </p> <p><span>More important, CENTCOM still does not release casualty assessments or counts disaggregated by strike in Yemen. This is in contrast to AFRICOM, which has in many cases reported not just strike locations and dates, but casualty counts with regards to strikes in Somalia – often immediately following the occurrence of strikes.</span></p> <p>Who Flies over Yemen’s Skies?</p> <p>Increased difficulty attributing drone strikes to a specific actor also clouds the picture. While in the past the United States was the only actor operating drones over Yemen (so attribution of strikes was relatively easy), that is no longer the case. According to Mohammed Ghobari, a Yemen correspondent for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-al-qaeda/six-suspected-al-qaeda-militants-killed-in-yemen-drone-strike-idUSKCN1NU0OZ">Reuters</a>, “with the collapse of the central state in Yemen, the presence of UAE and Saudi forces in Yemen which also … contain drones, it is difficult for journalists to know exactly who conducted the strike.”</p> <p>Indeed, the United States continues to conduct drone strikes in Yemen, but the U.S.-backed Saudi coalition has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/27/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-war-tactics-yemen-humanitarian-crisis.html">conducting</a> its own airstrikes with high civilian casualty rates. The United Arab Emirates, for example, has reportedly <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/">conducted</a> drone strikes against Houthi forces. Even the Houthi rebels are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/houthi-drones-kill-several-at-yemeni-military-parade-idUSKCN1P40N9">operating</a> armed drones over Yemen’s skies.</p> <p>The challenge of determining responsibility for a strike is further compounded by the question of whether CENTCOM is the only part of the U.S. government conducting strikes or whether there are covert strikes taking place. At least in Syria, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/trump-admin-wants-increase-cia-drone-strikes-n802311">reportedly</a> sought to expand the role of the CIA in drone strikes beyond limits imposed during the Obama administration. </p> <p><span>This complex environment was illustrated by the CENTCOM press release summarizing strikes in 2018</span></p> <p>High Stakes Demand Greater Transparency Going Forward</p> <p>The Trump administration and CENTCOM should be lauded for better reporting this year that has meaningfully improved the tracking of the counterterrorism war in Yemen. Further improvements could be made, including reporting casualty assessments disaggregated by strike, reporting ground raids, and making individualized strike and ground raid information available through official press releases (rather than only in response to requests).</p> <p><span>At least 1,300 people have been killed in the counterterrorism war in Yemen, according to New America’s research. That is almost certainly an undercount. The lack of transparency in this war prevents the American public from fully knowing the nature of what is being conducted in their name. With counterterrorism strikes occurring amidst a larger civil and proxy war, the stakes of this lack of transparency are high – by David Sterman</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/62389/centcom-improves-transparency-yemen-war-yemens-expanded-proxy-war-raises-challenges/">https://www.justsecurity.org/62389/centcom-improves-transparency-yemen-war-yemens-expanded-proxy-war-raises-challenges/</a> </span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>The swine flu symptoms usually develop within 1-3 days of becoming infected.

Yet, the general public and mass media in western countries have increasingly become aware of the situation and of the military deadlock up to the point it would now be wrong to continue asserting this war is happening behind closed doors. Information exists and is widely available. However, what probably remains hidden or silenced are Yemeni voices. These have a tendency to be either ignored or to see their claims confiscated by so‑called western experts. Willingly or not, they have been largely deprived of access to the public space and to debate on “their” war. Hence the frequent claim made that “there are no journalists in Yemen”, actually meaning no Western ones! In the Arab media, the financial control of the Gulf states responsible for the bombing of the country itself has generated further biases and has often deprived Yemenis of their subjectivity.</p> <p>Thus Franck Mermier’s editorial project to translate Arabic texts published by Yemeni intellectuals into French is a most opportune contribution.</p> <p>This Yemen focused‑publication helps correct a manifest injustice. “It seems we are not part of the world,” writes journalist Jamal Jubran in a beautiful text made available here to the French speaking public. Beyond Franck Mermier's ambition to “break the halo of aloofness” and “to destroy the wall of indifference that surrounds Yemen”, the book project also needed to account for the complexity of what is unfolding in the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. It was in particular important to highlight the variety of positions and analyzes. Indeed, in Yemen perhaps more than elsewhere, society and the intellectual field remain fragmented to the extreme. Between supporters of the Houthi militia, Southern activists, socialists, liberals, Islamist and feminist voices, the narratives that can be delivered are frequently antagonistic. <br /> Franck Mermier's in‑depth knowledge of the Yemeni terrain and of the intellectual field in the country have helped him cherry‑pick fourteen texts written by eight writers or journalists, half of whom are women.</p> <p>While the ambition of the publication deserves the highest praises, the selection made by Franck Mermier may well leave specialists of Yemeni contemporary society and politics a little uneasy.</p> <p>However, this approach unintentionally obscures a significant part of Yemeni society. The contributions certainly break the silence or surpass the “international ostracism” described by Habib Abdulrab Sarori in his chapter, but at the same time generate some misunderstandings about the reality of internal power relations in Yemen or the interpretations of the roots of the war – by Laurent <span>Bonnefoy</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://journals.openedition.org/cy/4371">https://journals.openedition.org/cy/4371</a></span></p> <p><span>French version: </span><span><a href="https://www.en-attendant-nadeau.fr/2018/12/03/pour-yemen-mermier/">https://www.en-attendant-nadeau.fr/2018/12/03/pour-yemen-mermier/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B K P)</span></p> <p>Book: Yemen and the World: Beyond Insecurity</p> <p>The influence of Yemen and its people extends far beyond its nominal borders, both historically and in the present day, as Laurent Bonnefoy reveals.</p> <p><span>Contemporary Yemen has an image problem. It has long fascinated travellers and artists, and to many embodies both Arab and Muslim authenticity; it stands at important geostrategic and commercial crossroads. Yet, strangely, global perceptions of Yemen are of an entity that is somehow both marginal and passive, yet also dangerous and problematic.</span></p> <p><span>The Saudi offensive launched in 2015 has made Yemen a victim of regional power struggles, while the global ‘war on terror’ has labelled it a threat to international security. This perception has had disastrous effects without generating real interest in the country or its people. On the contrary, Yemen’s complex political dynamics have been largely ignored by international observers—resulting in problematic, if not counterproductive, international policies.</span></p> <p><em>Yemen and the World</em><span> offers a corrective to these misconceptions and omissions, putting aside the nature of the world’s interest in Yemen to focus on Yemen’s role on the global stage. Laurent Bonnefoy uses six areas of modern international exchange—globalisation, diplomacy, trade, migration, culture and militant Islamism—to restore Yemen to its place at the heart of contemporary affairs. To understand Yemen, he argues, is to understand the Middle East as a whole.</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/yemen-and-the-world/">https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/yemen-and-the-world/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B K P)</span></p> <p>Few hopes of reaching peace in Yemen</p> <p>The United Nations is looking to adopt another approach to bring the Yemen crisis to an end after a number of failed attempts in 2018.</p> <p>Now, the UN seems to be taking a different path and adopting another approach. One of these approaches is the recent approval of the 75-strong monitoring team.</p> <p>Relying on the same diplomatic techniques has led the UN nowhere and Yemen remains languishing in war, bloodshed and violence. Accordingly, the ongoing presence of the UN supervisors in Hodeida is synonymous with direct and serious involvement. </p> <p>Although these UN monitors are said to be unarmed, their presence could set the stage for larger involvement in the future.</p> <p>The UN's magnifying role in Yemen could be a double-edged sword. It could coerce the warring parties to de-escalate, respect the peace talks and forge a solution; this is a positive role. On the other hand, it may continue adopting partial measures to defuse the conflict areas of the country only, and this means the war will persist and the solutions for the deep-rooted political crisis will be unattained.</p> <p>Prioritising aid delivery or peace progress?</p> <p>The prime concern of the UN is the provision of aid to the people of Yemen. This is not enough. The same level of concern should be given to the political issues. Should Yemen's political crisis receive insufficient attention from the international community, this year will be also bloody, catastrophic and miserable for millions of Yemenis.</p> <p>Yemen does not solely cry out for food. It is also in dire need of ending the destructive war and raging violence in several parts of the country. The feed-them-and-let-them-fight policy in Yemen needs to be stopped because this will only fan the flames of war.</p> <p>New year escalation</p> <p>Amid such violent developments at the outset of the year, hope appears faint that the two parties will reach a consensus on peace in the country.<br /> While the peaceful solution is still an option, it is also possible that the government forces will this year attempt vast military advances against the Houthis to dictate a new status quo in post-war Yemen.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/amp/indepth/2019/1/24/few-hopes-of-reaching-peace-in-yemen">https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/amp/indepth/2019/1/24/few-hopes-of-reaching-peace-in-yemen</a></span></p> <p><span>(B K P)</span></p> <p><span>[Hadi government] </span>Ministry of Human Rights reported that 25,000 <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/children?src=hash">#children</a></span> were recruited in Yemen's four-year civil war</p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/RepYemenEnglish/status/1089502036041838592">https://twitter.com/RepYemenEnglish/status/1089502036041838592</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp3 Humanitäre Lage / Humanitarian situation</span></h2> <p>Siehe / Look at cp1</p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p>Health office has recorded 3 deaths and 394 cases of malnutrition in Zenzibar and Khanfar districts in Abyan province during one week.</p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1090006196835225600">https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1090006196835225600</a> </span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span>Film: </span>Jemen: Mohammed steht vor verschlossenen Türen</p> <p>Mohammed hatte sich so sehr gefreut, dass die Schule wieder losgehen sollte.

Despite the supposed cessation of hostilities, aid and commercial goods still “are not yet flowing in at the level needed to address the unfolding crisis”, an open letter signed by 14 leading charities also said.</p> <p>There have been multiple reports of the fighting in and around Hodeidah continuing with both the Houthi rebels and Yemeni government blaming each other. Isabelle Carlsen, operations director at Action Against Hunger, said in a recent two-day visit to the area she heard consistent instances of violence.</p> <p>According to Ms Carlsen the nutrition situation “continues to be extremely serious and catastrophic with severe limitations on access to potable water and health treatment. She said over two million children are affected by malnutrition, a situation worsened by the destruction of water and medical facilities.</p> <p>A fire last week exacerbated the already desperate situation by damaging two silos holding food in a tragic incident seemingly started by mortar fire on the outskirts of Hodeidah.</p> <p>The letter by the charity chiefs said some parents had felt compelled to give their children contaminated food or water, or nothing at all. They also wrote of reports of the elderly having to sell clothes or homes just to get by.</p> <p>Extreme difficulties facing humanitarian workers in gaining access include the dangers of conflict which often means long journeys over short distances because of the numerous checkpoints and necessary permits.</p> <p>Awssan Kamal, head of campaigns at Oxfam International, said hunger was stigmatised in a social system where many victims “don’t want to talk about how hungry they are”. The audience also heard that food insecurity was not always linked to frontline conflict – the collapse of the economy and currency were also held responsible. Villages suffering from “acute” malnutrition would often only have bread and tea without milk to survive on.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/charities-appeal-for-people-first-in-yemen-1.819113">https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/charities-appeal-for-people-first-in-yemen-1.819113</a> </span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span>Christian Aid calls for more help for Yemen</span></p> <p>Christian Aid and another 13 charities are calling on the UK government to step up efforts to end the fighting in Yemen.</p> <p>An estimated 85,000 children have already died from extreme hunger and the charities say more than 14 million people are now facing starvation.</p> <p>They say it is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world and are urging all parties to the conflict to put the country's people first.</p> <p><span>Deborah Hyams, Humanitarian Policy and Advocacy Advisor for Christian Aid told Premier:</span></p> <p><span>"This is not a natural disaster.

In the last two months, escalated hostilities have killed tens of civilians and displaced hundreds of families from their homes especially in Haradh and Hayran districts.</span></p> <p><span>Partners on the ground report that at least 300 families have been displaced in the last three weeks to Abs District where they live in difficult conditions.</span></p> <p><span>Displacement is also reported from Bani Hassan village in Abs and Al Hamrah village in Mustaba District, due to proximity to areas of fighting.</span></p> <p><span>The hostilities in Hajjah intensified in mid-December 2018, with armed confrontations and shelling in Haradh, mainly around the main town and in Abs and Hayran Districts.</span></p> <p><span>Abs District already hosts an estimated 23,000 displaced families, most of whom have been displaced multiple times over the past four years, sometimes more, and are living in dire conditions. According to the Shelter Cluster, a total of 18,800 displaced families are living in 102 spontaneous settlements and collective centres in the district.</span></p> <p><span>Hajjah is one of the governorates with the highest severity of needs in Yemen. The findings of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) released in December indicate that more than a million people, out of a total population of 2.5 million, are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Out of 31 districts in the governorate, 28 are classified at IPC Phase 4 (Emergency); 5 have pockets of populations at IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Some 13 districts are among the 104 districts in Yemen that have the highest convergence of needs.</span></p> <p><span>Despite access and security challenges, 55 humanitarian partners were active in all the 31 districts of the governorate as on November; 9 UN, 17 international and 29 national NGOs. That included implementing and programme partners. The highest concentration of partners are Abs and Hajjah city while the lowest numbers are in Shares, Al Jamimah, Midi and Bani Al Awam districts.</span></p> <p><span>Civilian casualties have mounted</span></p> <p><span>Over the last two months, the civilian toll has risen significantly. Between 5 and 10 January, at least 12 civilians were killed and another 12 injured by artillery shells and airstrikes, according to the Protection Cluster’s Civilian Impact Monitoring Project. Eight of these casualties were killed when artillery shells struck houses in Ash Shalilah village in Haradh District. This is the highest number of civilian casualties reported in a single incident in the governorate since August 2018.</span></p> <p><span>The most serious needs are in Haradh District</span></p> <p><span>In Haradh, the most affected district, hospitals and other public service providers have closed due to fighting.</span></p> <p><span>Prior to the recent escalation, many families used to shuttle back and forth between their villages and neighbouring districts to receive humanitarian assistance, but movement has become more restricted.</span></p> <p>Humanitarian Response</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/hajjah-flash-update-1-27-january-2018">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/hajjah-flash-update-1-27-january-2018</a></span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p>Violence in Hajjah, Yemen's forgotten province, worsens humanitarian crisis</p> <p>More than 23,000 families are displaced in the governorate</p> <p>Violence in the Hajjah Governorate in the last few months has killed dozens of civilians, displaced hundreds and led to the intensification of the humanitarian disaster in Yemen, according to a new report released by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Afairs (OCHA).</p> <p>Both the Houthis and forces aligned with the Yemeni government have exchanged control of the strategically important province since the civil war broke out. But recent clashes, despite the so-called ceasefire, have forced families to seek refuge in areas relatively safe from the violence.</p> <p>Hajjah province has become a refuge to hundreds of families fleeing the violence along the Saudi-Yemeni border and from Hodeidah. But clashes in the province, which see several key supply routes cut through its mountainous terrain leading from the Red Sea Coast to Houthi-held Sanaa, has played host to violence spilling over from Hodeidah, the Red Sea port city held by the Houthi rebels.</p> <p>The Hajoor tribe, a prominent tribe in north Yemen led by Salafi figure Sheikh Yahya Al Hajoori, have taken up the battle against the Houthis in the province – flaring tensions between the Sunni tribe and the Houthi rebels. Clashes between the Houthis and the Hajoor’s trail back to 2011, when clashes between the two tribes in Hajjah caused thousands of families in the province to flee.</p> <p>Recent violence, the worst in the province since August 2018, has seen at least 30 civilians killed and another 52 injured by artillery shells and airstrikes in the last 30 days alone. Three children and two women were killed in the violence.</p> <p>This has displaced at least 300 families displaced in the last three weeks to Abs District where they live in difficult conditions, many without proper care despite several UN organisations on the ground.</p> <p>“Abs District already hosts an estimated 23,000 displaced families, most of whom have been displaced multiple times over the past four years, sometimes more, and are living in dire conditions,” said the OCHA report.</p> <p>The hostilities in Hajjah intensified in mid-December 2018, with armed confrontations and shelling in Haradh, mainly around the main town and in Abs and Hayran Districts.</p> <p>Hajjah is among the governorates with the highest severity of needs in Yemen.

Preliminary results of a Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) Food Security Analysis indicates that more than 20 million Yemenis – two thirds ofthe population – are now food insecure. Ten million ofthem are found to be severely food insecure – more than twice the number of four years ago. In addition, more than half the districts across the country have slipped into “emergency” conditions – nearly 60 per cent more than in 2017.</p> <p>By December 2018 , UNFPA's response in Yemen reached nearly a million vulnerable women and girls with reproductive health and protection services; significantly expanding its coverage and size of humanitarian operations, resulting in an increase of 77% in the number of health facilities supported by UNFPA (133 in 2017 to 235 in 2018); and increasing the availability of protection services by more than four times that in 2017.

Impatients, les exilés qui s’y pressent, demandent en arrivant à s’embarquer dans un boutre. Certains semblent encore ignorer que le Yémen est en guerre.

Déserté par les autorités, l’école y est fermée depuis trois ans, l’électricité a été coupée et l’eau ne se trouve plus qu’au puits.

The Houthi movement was initially formed because sections of the population in the north felt that they had been marginalised in Saleh’s system of patronage - there were some in that area who had done better in money raising activities such as border trade and smuggling. So initially many of the areas of conflict were very local to the Saada and Hajjah region and related to inequality. No doubt these tensions still exist and it seems to me that UAE and Hadi in the south and finding it difficult to rub along together and so are factions in the north. As the war goes on new alliances form and fighting between former 'allies' becomes more common. And the ordinary civilians who just want the war to end are ignored.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157322681308641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157322681308641</a></span></p> <p><span>and following report:</span></p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p>Cautious calm in Hajur after violent night battles and the coalition did not bomb the Houthi sites</p> <p>The Directorate of “Kasher” in the northwestern province of Hajjah is cautiously calm on Monday, after a night of fierce fighting between tribesmen and militants of the Houthi group, which resulted in the deaths of the latter.</p> <p>The Al-Masdar online correspondent said that last night's battles began with the Houthis attempting to attack tribesmen from the al-Darb and Rayban areas, but the tribesmen repelled the attack, and heavy machine guns continued to be fired until morning.</p> <p>A number of Houthis were killed and wounded, he added.</p> <p>He noted that the Houthis tried to penetrate Hajur tribes from the south, and started firing at a number of positions in the direction of the Aflah al-Sham directorate, but the tribesmen were ready.</p> <p>According to our correspondent, tribesmen continued to arrive in the area to support Hajur tribes, including gunmen who had joined the al-Houthi group earlier, but who defected from the group to support their tribe.</p> <p>On the one hand, the Houthis continue to rally hundreds of their gunmen with light and heavy weapons in Amran province, in preparation for progress in the Directorate of Kasher, and end the resistance of Hajur tribes, one of the fiercest tribes in Yemen.</p> <p>Our correspondent denied that coalition fighters had raided al-Houthi positions in the vicinity of Kasher Directorate since the tension between the two sides began, contrary to al-Arabiya, which earlier reported that the coalition had raided the Houthi positions.</p> <p>He said that during the past few hours the Houthis had launched artillery shelling of the Al-Obaisa area, which could herald a major attack on the Houthis in the coming hours if the al-Houthi siege on the Directorate continues.</p> <p><span><a href="http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163670">http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163670</a> </span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>Yemen: Houthis Loot Health Employee Funds</p> <p>The Iran-backed Houthi militias in Yemen have looted millions of rials allocated for health centers' personnel in Houthi-held regions, a source in the Ministry of Health and Population in Sanaa has revealed.<br /> The source, who preferred to remain anonymous, said some influential individuals in the ministry received huge amounts of money originally dedicated to health centers' employees.

There is a window of opportunity that was opened for Yemen in Sweden, and it is important to seize this opportunity, and to capitalize on the momentum we have seen during and after Sweden. That momentum is still there, even if we have seen the timelines for implementation extended, both in Hodediah and with regard to the prisoner exchange agreement. Yet such changes in timelines are expected, in light of the facts that: 1-the timelines were rather ambitious; and 2-we are dealing with a complex situation on the ground. <br /> What is important to me is that both parties continue to demonstrate political will in abiding by the Stockholm Agreement, and both parties are constructively and seriously engaged for the full implementation of the Agreement.

Sever challenges to the peace and stability of these regions along with overarching transnational terrorism threats have incentivized the erosion of human rights by the respective governments. These challenges are well-documented in press reporting, and in the lived experiences of two participants in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tushJaeLSzo">my recent discussions at the American Society of International Law.</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/11/uae-pardons-british-citizen-who-had-been-sentenced-to-life-in-prison/">Matthew Hedges</a>, a 31-year-old Durham University PhD student, was held in solitary confinement for seven months in the UAE after being accused of spying for the U.K. government.</p> <p>Domestic laws ostensibly designed to protect the public that simultaneously provide valid reasons for the abuse of basic human rights and the degradation of human dignity cannot be ignored. Harnessing domestic judicial systems to empower such violations represents the <em>sine quibus non</em> of systematic human rights violations. This pattern of abuse is far too common in the region, representing the capstone of a coordinated suppression of fundamental human rights.</p> <p>Sovereign nations have the absolute right to enact and enforce laws that are the best-suited to protect their citizens and defend legitimate interests. All nations enjoy these prerogatives. This legitimate duty of the state to protect the common good operates in healthy friction with the concurrent obligations to uphold human rights and the dignity of persons within the ambit of state power.</p> <p>The UAE has ignored this friction in pursuit of domestic counter-terrorism efforts during the conflict in Yemen. The Saudi and the UAE-led coalition has isolated and degraded Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, while sharply curtailing the extent of Houthi/Iranian influence in Yemen. These salutary ends do not always justify the means. Documented reports of enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, erosion of basic human rights and the subversion of rights under <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/375-590006">Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions</a> tell that sad tale.</p> <p>These issues represent a thicket of complex legal concerns. The actions of the UAE security and proxy forces are diagnostic in documenting human rights violations. Routine denials by the UAE officials do not dispel these difficult truisms. T</p> <p>We need to reconcile the gap between these legal regimes, human rights obligations and the experiences of people on the ground.

I was kept practically incommunicado, able to make only two brief calls to my mother to report (falsely, under duress) that I was well.

The Shia crescent seems to have adopted a more rigid stance and Sana’a will soon join in unless the risk is addressed by moving to protect Aden and its coastline all the way to al-Mahrah.</p> <p>The necessity of separating the south from the north in Yemen is no longer just related to southern Yemenis’ right to sovereignty as it is to the existential issue of Arab national security.</p> <p><span><a href="https://thearabweekly.com/seeing-big-picture-yemen">https://thearabweekly.com/seeing-big-picture-yemen</a></span></p> <p><span>(A H P)</span></p> <p>Emergency assistance reaches Hammat Sarar, Yemen</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/emergency-assistance-reaches-hammat-sarar-yemen">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/emergency-assistance-reaches-hammat-sarar-yemen</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp16 Saudische Luftangriffe / Saudi air raids</span></h2> <p><span>(* A K pH)</span></p> <p><span>Saudi coalition air raids and shelling day by day</span></p> <p><span>Jan. 27: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/pb.551288185021551.-2207520000.1548739651./1230802940403402/">https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/pb.551288185021551.-2207520000.1548739651./1230802940403402/</a> </span></p> <p><span>Jan. 26: </span><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/pb.551288185021551.-2207520000.1548609611./1230096177140745/">https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/pb.551288185021551.-2207520000.1548609611./1230096177140745/</a></span></p> <p><span>(A K pS)</span></p> <p>Dozens of Houthis killed in raids in Yemen’s Al-Jawf and Saada</p> <p> Dozens of Houthi militants were killed in Arab coalition airstrikes and clashes with the Yemeni army in Al-Jawf and Saada provinces on Monday night, Saudi state-news agency SPA reported.</p> <p>The coalition raids targeted members of the militia making their way to the Al-Jawf front, while ground troops attacked the Houthis in Saada’s Baqim</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.arabnews.com/node/1443711/middle-east">http://www.arabnews.com/node/1443711/middle-east</a> </span></p> <p><span>(A K pS)</span></p> <p>Arab Coalition steps up air strikes targeting Houthi gatherings in Yemen</p> <p>The Arab Coalition backing Yemen’s legitimate government launched 15 air strikes against Houthi militia gatherings in the Hajjah governorate, northwest of the country on Sunday, according to Al Arabiya sources.</p> <p>On Saturday, coalition fighter jets staged eight air strikes targeting Houthi reinforcements near the Hajour tribal areas.</p> <p>On Thursday, Yemen’s Hajour tribes had appealed for support from the Arab Coalition to confront an attack staged by the militias against the al-Abysa tribe of Hajour in the district of Kashar using rockets and heavy artillery.</p> <p>The militias had indiscriminately shelled the villages of al-Abysa tribe with heavy artillery, according to eyewitnesses.</p> <p><span><a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2019/01/28/Arab-Coalition-steps-up-air-strikes-targeting-Houthi-gatherings-in-Yemen-s-Hajjah.html">https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2019/01/28/Arab-Coalition-steps-up-air-strikes-targeting-Houthi-gatherings-in-Yemen-s-Hajjah.html</a> </span></p> <p><span>Remark: For this conflict look at cp5.

So she suddenly is in the middle of it. In Yemen.</p> <p>Arabia according to the cocktail table</p> <p>It took more than two years, but in Yemen I suddenly found myself in the middle of it: the Arab world as we imagine it in Europe at the cocktail table. Where men on the conveyor belt suppress and harass heavily veiled women. Now you will not hear me say that the emancipation is good in the Arab world, but as roughly as we imagine it from the Dutch armchair, I have rarely encountered Middle East reporting in two years. Not in Syria. Not in Iraq. Not in Libya. In all those countries I can work without any hassle as a woman. Of course that does not mean everything, because I'm only a guest there, but I do have something. 'Iraq, Syria, Libya,' my Yemeni fixer will sigh when the night in Mokka lies behind us. "They are all secular countries. Yemen is a religious country. "</p> <p>How is it for the women in Yemen itself? Just as you think you understand something about it, you, as a Western listener, appear to have been completely misled. The day before our overnight stay in Mokka I have a conversation in a coffee shop in Aden, the second city of Yemen. The war in Yemen has brought a strange prosperity as a result of a lucrative frontline economy. Aden teems with trendy coffee shops, such as Cup Coffee, where barista makes cappuccino and latte macchiato.</p> <p>Child weddings</p> <p>Child marriages are normal in Yemen, as I later meet with women's rights activist Leila Shahibi, who in Aden for years ran a kind of living room project for women. She talks about a mother who started to cry because she realized that marrying off her 13-year-old daughter was not such a good idea. Shahibi: 'In the countryside, 13 years is a normal age to get married. Some approach it from a religious perspective. The Prophet Muhammad himself married a young girl, so it is not wrong. We do not go into religion. That would give big problems. We approach it scientifically. Yes, the Prophet Muhammad married young. But there are texts that show that he had no fellowship until years later. " In the Yemen of the 21st century, a child marriage is directly consumed? Shahibi: "Of course."</p> <p>Instructions for the imam</p> <p>In Yemen, one female minister, of social affairs, is not an important portfolio in this country. No female parliamentarian. Not one of the 301 members of parliament. Women hardly play a significant role during peace talks. Even resolution 1325, which gives women rights on paper, is so sensitive that it is hardly discussed openly. Otherwise it seems as if you are trying to smuggle Western values into Yemen. How do they talk in Yemen about women's rights? Women instruct men. More precisely: the imam. The imam is asked to talk to men about 'the problems of women'.</p> <p>In the break, I meet Anisha Tarboush, a businesswoman with striking eyebrows under a colored headscarf.

Almost perfect.</p> <p>(* B )</p> <p>Keeping Yemen Alive</p> <p>We shouldn’t report on a war without highlighting other components that are just as important, such as how people live during the conflict, how they cope, and their innovative, creative and resilient spirits. Let’s talk about how teachers are continuing to teach despite the fact that they haven’t received their salaries in months. Let’s talk about how artistic expression has flourished in the midst of war, how new book clubs, music videos, films, and photo exhibits have emerged. Yemenis----like others living in war zones----also create beauty amidst the ugliness. If these stories aren’t told, we lose our voice, we lose our dignity. We appear without agency.</p> <p>I don’t want the memories of my Yemen to be overshadowed by media reports. I am terrified that I will forget what burning incense smelled like in a crowded room filled with laughing women and ‘oud. Or the taste of street hot potatoes with cumin and peppers. In the midst of daily deaths, my resistance is to keep the Yemen I remember alive. My resistance is to prevent my memories from being hijacked by all the blood. My resistance is to keep Yemeni culture present in everything I do and transfer its beauty to my daughter – by Atiaf Z.
