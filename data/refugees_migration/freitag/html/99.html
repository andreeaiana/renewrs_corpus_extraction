Guns and bombs are claiming lives, but hunger is another major threat to Yemenis. The World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization say 73,000 Yemeni civilians are facing famine and another 14 million are on the brink of starvation. Aid agencies say more than 1.8 million children under the age of 5 are acutely malnourished.

It remains catastrophic. More than 24 million people now need humanitarian assistance – that’s 80 per cent of the population. They include 10 million people just a step away from famine. More than 3.3 million people have been displaced – over 600,000 of them in the last 12 months.</p> <p>Only half of health facilities are fully functioning. Hundreds of thousands of people got sick last year because of poor sanitation and water-borne diseases, including cholera. Needs have intensified across all sectors. Millions of Yemenis are hungrier, sicker and more vulnerable now than they were a year ago.</p> <p>Humanitarian agencies are scaling up to meet these needs.</p> <p>Because we are committed to an effective response, we had already contracted independent third-party monitors last autumn. In their first report, they found that 95 per cent of intended food aid beneficiaries contacted across the country confirmed that they were indeed receiving food aid. In some cases, rations were not always complete. These gaps could potentially be due to funding or access constraints, or other problems. More detailed independent monitoring of this sort is currently under way. It would not surprise me, Mr. President, if problems where to emerge in other parts of the country. But we will always act to find solutions when that happens.</p> <p>It is also important to know that the Sana’a problem itself was identified through existing monitoring mechanisms, and that WFP, with support from the Humanitarian Coordinator, has acted decisively. They and the de-facto authorities are having intensive, constructive discussions on the way forward, and we are optimistic that the right measures will be in place before the next round of distributions is slated to begin. Steps to improve targeting and delivery mechanisms are being taken as we speak.</p> <p>Unfortunately, over the last six weeks, de-facto authorities have blocked humanitarian supplies travelling from areas under their control to Government-held areas. They have also recently informed humanitarian agencies that 72 hours’ notice is required ahead of any movements instead of the usual 48 hours. We are also concerned by administrative restrictions being imposed on international NGOs as they renew their operating agreements, as well as ongoing challenges with monitoring.</p> <p>Restrictions are also being tightened on specific types of programming, including protection and support for victims of sexual and gender-based violence.</p> <p>Continuing delays and unacceptable pre-conditions for the planned medical air-bridge from Sana’a airport also mean that thousands of people with medical conditions for which treatment is unavailable in northern Yemen are condemned to suffer.</p> <p>Taken together, these developments are delaying and interrupting critical humanitarian programmes. But solutions can be agreed. Just today, we received confirmation that 56 new visas will be granted to UN staff. That is an important step into the right direction.</p> <p>Your resolution also calls for impediments to commercial imports to be lifted.

From August to December 2018, MSF teams in Mocha treated more than 150 people wounded by mines, improvised explosive devices and unexploded ordnance—one third of them children, who had been playing in fields.</p> <p>Current mine clearance efforts in the area are managed by the military and are focused on roads and strategic infrastructure, paying little heed to civilian areas such as agricultural fields. Civilians are the principal victims of the mines and explosive devices in the area, as many are killed or maimed for life.</p> <p>By creating generations of maimed people, mines have far-reaching repercussions—not only for individual families, but for society as a whole, as their victims are likely to be more dependent on others and more socially isolated.</p> <p>Ali, an 18-year-old from a small village in a rural and very poor area near Mawza, was wounded two months ago when he stepped on a land mine in a field near his house. His right leg was amputated under his knee, compounding difficulties he had with a weak left leg due to polio in childhood. He now comes to MSF's hospital in Mocha for physiotherapy twice a week.</p> <p>Not a day goes by without war-wounded people like Ali arriving at MSF's hospital from the front lines between Taïz and Hodeidah. It is the only facility in the region with an operating theater and the capacity to perform surgery.</p> <p>"The war-wounded often get to Mocha very late and many are in a critical condition," said Husni Abdallah, a nurse in the operating theater. "They contract infections because on the front line they aren't always stabilized as well as they should be. Mines cause particularly severe injuries, so we see complex fractures that are difficult to operate on. Patients often have to have amputations and then require months and months of rehabilitation."</p> <p>The area has become largely devoid of medical care because of the war, with the next closest medical facilities in Aden, six to eight hours' drive away. Many local people cannot afford transportation to Aden or the costs of treatment there.</p> <p>"The coastal region between Hodeidah and Aden is rural and extremely poor," Abdallah said. "People have no access to medical treatment and our hospital is the only place they can go when they need surgery. . .Some don't manage to get to Mocha in time and die of wounds that could have been treated. Or they’re pregnant women who die during labor due to a lack of adequate medical care."</p> <p>Thousands of explosive devices will endanger the lives of people in Yemen for decades to come. The UK-based organization Conflict Armament Research pointed in a <span><a href="http://www.conflictarm.com/dispatches/mines-and-ieds-employed-by-houthi-forces-on-yemens-west-coast/">recent report</a></span> to Ansar Allah's mass production of mines and improvised explosive devices, as well as its use of anti-personnel, vehicle, and naval mines. According to the Yemen Executive Mine Action Center, the Yemeni army cleared 300,000 mines between 2016 and 2018.</p> <p>Since MSF opened its hospital in Mocha, its staff have provided more than 2,000 emergency room consultations and performed about 1,000 surgical procedures. MSF works in a total of 12 hospitals and health centers across the country and provides support to more than 20 hospitals or health facilities across 11 governorates: Abyan, Aden, Amran, Hajjah, Hodeidah, Ibb, Lahj, Saada, Sana’a, Shabwah, and Taiz.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/yemen-land-mines-take-heavy-toll-civilians">https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/yemen-land-mines-take-heavy-toll-civilians</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-land-mines-take-heavy-toll-civilians">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-land-mines-take-heavy-toll-civilians</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p> <p><strong>Yemen: Forgotten Women Amid a Forgotten War</strong></p> <p>Yemen’s civil war has raged since 2015 but amid reporting on violence, disease and food insecurity, the impact of the conflict on women is often overlooked.</p> <p><span>Mariam (a pseudonym) was 24 years old and seven months pregnant with her third child when she died.</span></p> <p>The midwife was unable to maneuver it ready for birth. The hospital’s only obstetrician – the only one in the whole district – had just left, after working for two years without salary.</p> <p>The only way to save Mariam and her child was to refer them to a private hospital. An ambulance made the transfer but Mariam was turned away at the hospital door, unable to pay for the treatment she needed. A cesarean section can cost up to US $300 in Yemen, with patients asked to pay in advance before being granted admission. Mariam was sent back to the rural hospital, where nothing could be done to save her and the baby.</p> <p>Mariam’s story is not rare or unusual in Yemen, a country torn apart by a conflict that erupted in 2015 and still seems far from over. Hodeidah has been a focal point of the fighting since June 2018. In 2013, Yemen’s estimated ratio of women dying as a result of complications from pregnancy was 148 per every 100 000 live births according to <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/what-we-do/survey/survey-display-358.cfm">Demographic Health Survey</a> data. By the onset of the civil war in 2015, it had more than doubled to 365 deaths per 100 000 according to <a href="https://yemen.unfpa.org/en/about-yemen">UNFPA</a>estimates. Data collection has now become increasingly challenging.</p> <p>In Italy, where I am from, this “maternal mortality ratio” is four deaths for every 100 000 live births.</p> <p>The journey of a pregnant woman to give birth can be a dangerous one in Yemen. The steps of that journey are striking examples of how difficult things that we take for granted have become – like health care. Women in Yemen often need permission from the head of the household to seek health care services. They need money to afford journeys to health facilities – journeys that can take up to five hours. They need hope that they won’t be delayed at checkpoints. They need hope that the hospital is still standing, knowing that half of all primary health centres in Yemen are no longer fully functional and are the target of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm0TYebjyHQ">direct attacks</a>. Even if the hospital remains standing, there is no guarantee that it has the necessary drugs or equipment to deal with the cases it receives. On the other hand, medicine and equipment are of little use if there are no skilled health professionals available – often the case given that most <a href="https://www.unocha.org/yemen/about-ocha-yemen">have not received their salary for the past two years</a> or more.</p> <p>Much has been written about Yemen and the dramatic cost of the ongoing conflict on its citizens. Yet few crises in the world have less evidence about the impact of conflict on women – by Claudia Truppa</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/yemen-forgotten-women-amid-a-forgotten-war/">http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/yemen-forgotten-women-amid-a-forgotten-war/</a> </span></p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Focus On The Political In Yemen</strong></p> <p>Despite meager progress in United Nations-led negotiations between the warring sides in Yemen, a cessation of hostilities, never mind a durable peace, is not likely to follow soon. After all, political barriers still stand. As Chatham House’s Peter Salisbury <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/12/21/what-does-the-stockholm-agreement-mean-for-yemen/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.13e48a860296">states,</a></span> “What was agreed to in Sweden, then, does not constitute a major political breakthrough but, rather, ramped-up international pressure that is by no means guaranteed in the future, and a degree of pragmatism from the Yemeni parties and their international backers that may not last.”</p> <p>A recent <span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-saudis-want-peace-in-yemen-11545598864?utm_source=Eye+on+Iran%3A+As+Economy+Withers%2C+Iran+Imposes+Harsh+Crackdown+On+Fraud&amp;utm_campaign=eye-on-iran&amp;utm_medium=email">opinion piece</a></span> from the Saudi ambassador to Yemen in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>doubles down on the kingdom’s maximalist demands in the Yemen conflict. Saudi Arabia will not cease its military operations without something it can advertise as a military victory.</p> <p>Thus far, the UN-facilitated talks have understandably focused on the people with the guns. After all, the negotiations are structured to achieve a halt of military violence that could then facilitate a legitimate political process. But the two sides represented in Stockholm are ill-equipped for that next phase. The Houthis, a political-military movement representing the Shia minority, have limited national legitimacy, and the Yemeni government has no actual base of support inside the country and is largely beholden to its foreign military backers.</p> <p>Experts have <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/31/magazine/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html">noted</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302064592_Iran's_policy_towards_the_Houthis_in_Yemen_A_limited_return_on_a_modest_investment">that</a></span> the Yemeni President, Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, has no practical legitimacy in Yemen, and <span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/4e4a659cc61d479d96e9591c80ef13d3">press</a></span> <span><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/war-and-pestilence-the-ongoing-fragmentation-of-yemen-a-1243730.html">reports</a></span> suggest that he is living under some form of “house arrest” in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Eventually, success in military de-escalation is expected to give way to a negotiated process that could facilitate a political transition, the writing of a constitution, and the formation of an inclusive interim government. But as the famine threat becomes a terrifying reality and the UN-facilitated process gingerly takes “<span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/yemen-warring-parties-hold-first-direct-meeting-of-sweden-peace-talks-idUSKBN1O80HV">baby steps</a></span>,” there is a growing imperative to employ some diplomatic creativity to alter the political realities around the conflict and pressure foreign influencers and hardliners in the warring sides. This can be achieved through amplifying the voices of the people of Yemen.</p> <p>To that end, the political process needs to start now, in parallel with the military de-escalation talks. Leaders from the Zaidi Shia community, the tribal leadership, the southern secessionists, the different Salafi groups, civil society groups, women’s groups, NGOs. and other stakeholders need to be invited to hold national dialogue events to formulate the framework of a political path forward. Rather than hoping for military de-escalation to lead to political dialogue, dialogue among Yemeni parties needs to shift weight away from military means and change political realities underlying the effort to end hostilities.</p> <p>Ideally, the UN special envoy would facilitate the talks. But since the dialogue’s legitimacy does not require an international mandate, any actor of high repute can volunteer to convene such a congress. It could be the high representative of the European Union or concerned governments who are not co-combatants such as Germany.</p> <p>A national dialogue that could initiate dialog between the Zaidi and other major groups as well as produce a framework for future governance can also nurture confidence in that community.</p> <p>This will certainly not be simple. The Saudis might oppose such a scheme because it might generate pressure on their military operations</p> <p>But any progress in formulating a framework for political reconciliation can have a profound moral effect by shifting the focus to the Yemeni people, their hopes and aspirations, rather than fixating on the tactical interests of Kalashnikov-wielding militiamen, a president with no constituency, and geopolitically ambitious royals from afar – by <em>Alireza Ahmadi</em></p> <p><span><a href="https://lobelog.com/focus-on-the-political-in-yemen/">https://lobelog.com/focus-on-the-political-in-yemen/</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Is Donald Trump an Asteroid?</strong></p> <p>Sixty-six million years ago, so the scientists <span><a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/how-an-asteroid-caused-extinction-of-dinosaurs.html">tell us</a></span>, an asteroid slammed into this planet. Landing on what’s now Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, it gouged out a crater 150 kilometers wide and <span><a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/dinosaurs-extinction-asteroid-chicxulub-soot-earth-science/">put</a></span> so much soot and sulfur into the atmosphere that it created what was essentially a prolonged “<span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/dinosaur-killing-asteroid-basically-brought-a-nuclear-w-1820048402">nuclear winter</a></span>.” During that time, among so many other species, large and small, the dinosaurs went down for the count.</p> <p>Talking about accomplishments: as humanity has armed itself ever more lethally, it has also transformed itself into the local equivalent of so many asteroids. Think, for instance, of that moment in the spring of 2003 when George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and crew launched the invasion of Iraq with <span><a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/101850/bush_s_faith_and_the_middle_east_aflame">dreams</a></span> of setting up a <em>Pax Americana</em> across the Greater Middle East and beyond. By the time U.S. troops entered Baghdad, the burning and looting of the Iraqi capital had already begun, leaving the National Museum of Iraq <span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/looting-iraq-16813540/">trashed</a></span> (gone were the <span><a href="https://archive.islamonline.net/?p=14875">tablets</a></span> on which Hammurabi first had a code of laws inscribed) and the National Library of Baghdad, with its tens of thousands of ancient manuscripts, <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/15/education.books">in flames</a></span>.

And it’s not faintly over yet.</p> <p>More remarkable still, just about all of this has largely been ignored in the country that functionally made it so. If you asked most Americans, they would certainly know that almost 3,000 civilians were slaughtered in the terror attacks of 9/11, but how many (if any) would be aware of the <span><a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175787/tomgram%3A_engelhardt,_washington%27s_wedding_album_from_hell/">several hundred</a></span> civilians -- brides, grooms, revelers, you name it -- similarly slaughtered in what were, in essence, U.S. terror attacks against multiple wedding parties in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Yemen? And that’s just to begin to mention the kinds of destruction that have gone on largely unnoticed here.</p> <p>In the first 18 years of this century, <span><a href="https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html">tens of millions</a></span> of people have been uprooted and displaced -- more than <span><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/29/where-displaced-syrians-have-resettled/">13 million</a></span> in Syria alone -- from what had been their homes, lives, and worlds.

In the process, Washington’s wars (and the conflicts that unfolded from them) unsettled ever more of the planet in much the way those particulates in the atmosphere did the world of 66 million years ago. So consider it an irony that, here in the U.S., so few connections have been made between such events and an unceasing series of American conflicts across the Greater Middle East and Africa -- or that the thought of even the mildest sorts of retreats from any of those battlegrounds instantly leaves political and national security elites in Washington (and the media that cover them) in an <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/opinion/sunday/trump-military-troops-iraq.html">uproar</a></span> of horror.</p> <p>Consider this a tale of imperial power gone awry that -- were anyone here truly paying attention -- could hardly have been uglier.

The report was apparently submitted to Congress last month but only released publicly when The Intercept <span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/01/07/yemen-prison-torture-uae-dod/">published</a></span> a <span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5676973-Congress-Yemen-Report.html#document/p1">copy</a></span> of it last night. I had written that the report would present an opportunity for the administration to introduce some much-needed transparency surrounding the ongoing U.S.-Emirati counterterrorism campaign in Yemen and to make conclusively clear that the United States is not returning to the morally and legally dodgy days after 9/11. It does none of that. In a mere two pages of carefully parsed prose, the Department of Defense (DoD) has provided what can only be described as a deliberately misleading and deceptively evasive account of U.S. and Emirati actions in Yemen that amounts to the ultimate non-denial denial.</p> <p>DoD’s report comes more than 18 months after the initial allegations of abuse emerged via Associated Press <span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/4925f7f0fa654853bd6f2f57174179fe">reporting</a></span> and after <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/22/yemen-uae-backs-abusive-local-forces">Human Rights Watch</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/07/disappearances-and-torture-in-southern-yemen-detention-facilities-must-be-investigated-as-war-crimes/">Amnesty International</a></span>, and the <span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23479">United Nations</a></span> all conducted their own research and concluded the same. Yet despite this growing mountain of evidence, compiled by highly reputable sources, the DoD report variously hops from claims that the Department did not actually witness these abuses to reaffirming that of course the Department has standards in place to address abuses, but it does not ever directly address the core question of whether it thinks such abuses occurred, how much U.S. forces knew, and when they knew it. It’s a lawyered-up document designed to obscure the truth and allow the administration to continue its increasingly problematic partnership with the Emiratis with no real oversight or pushback.</p> <p>The report provides a master class in obfuscatory policy and legal writing and is worth unpacking in full.</p> <p>The paragraph then states, “DoD personnel have neither observed, nor been complicit in” abuses. Note that it does not say that our partner did not commit abuses, only that DoD personnel had not observed such abuses, apparently resting the assessment of abuses on visually witnessing an abuse versus learning of it through other means. The sentence concludes by saying that DoD personnel have not “been complicit in” such abuses, in the process totally glossing over the many possible gradations between not observing abuses and actively enabling them.</p> <p>The final section is where DoD descends into a full Khashoggi-like denial of the allegations.</p> <p>DOD takes detainee abuse allegations and the investigation of detainee abuse very seriously, whether it occurs in U.S. or foreign partner custody. Based on information to-date, DOD has not developed any independent, credible information indicating that U.S. allies or partners have abused detainees in Yemen.</p> <p>Moving to a discussion of human rights violations, the report again returns to procedural requirements rather than accounting of actions.</p> <p>This report is a shame and the group of policy staffers and lawyers who worked on it, as well as the higher-ups who approved it should be embarrassed. But for better or worse, with the report submitted, the onus is now on Congress. Hard questions need to be asked, answers need to be provided to the public, and steps need to be taken to ensure that our partners are not committing abuses.

So hat ein Vorstandsmitglied des Düsseldorfer Rüstungsproduzenten Rheinmetall Mitte November bestätigt, dass sein Unternehmen über Tochterfirmen im Ausland Kriegsgerät im Wert von über 100 Millionen Euro jährlich nach Saudi-Arabien liefert.[2] Dieser Betrag ist im Rüstungsexportbericht der Bundesregierung nicht enthalten. Abgewickelt werden die Lieferungen über Werke auf Sardinien (Rheinmetall Waffe Munition Italia, RWM Italia) und in Südafrika (Rheinmetall Denel Munition, RDM).[3] Die Bombenfabrik auf Sardinien wird ausgebaut; die Kooperation zwischen RDM und Saudi-Arabien wird intensiviert: Der noch recht junge saudische Rüstungskonzern SAMI (Saudi Arabian Military Industries), der vom ehemaligen Rheinmetall-Manager Andreas Schwer geführt wird, will den südafrikanischen Denel-Konzern übernehmen. In diesem Zusammenhang strebt er auch die Übernahme der Denel-Anteile (49 Prozent) an RDM an (german-foreign-policy.com berichtete [4]). SAMI selbst hat rund ein Dutzend deutsche Bürger, darunter mindestens drei ehemalige Rheinmetall-Mitarbeiter, angestellt, die den Konzern beim Aufbau einer eigenen Waffenproduktion unterstützen.[5] Anders als beispielsweise in den USA ist in Deutschland die mündliche Weitergabe von Rüstungs-Know how erlaubt; diese Gesetzeslücke ermöglicht den informellen Export deutscher Waffentechnologie.</p> <p>Partnernationen</p> <p>Nach Saudi-Arabien gelangen Produkte deutscher Rüstungskonzerne auch über andere Staaten in Europa, wenn sie in gemeinsam betriebenen Unternehmen hergestellt worden sind. Dies gilt insbesondere für Kampfjets. So haben sich Großbritannien und Saudi-Arabien im März vergangenen Jahres auf die Lieferung von 48 Flugzeugen des Typs Eurofighter geeinigt. An deren Herstellung sind deutsche Waffenschmieden beteiligt. Wie die Bundesregierung in einem Bericht an den Wirtschaftsausschuss des Bundestags bestätigt, "unterbindet keine Partnernation den Verkauf oder die Genehmigung des Verkaufs von Produkten oder Systemen des Programms an Dritte".[6] Die Verantwortung für den Export von Kampfjets lässt sich damit leicht auf Großbritannien abschieben, das schon die bisher von Saudi-Arabien genutzten Eurofighter geliefert hat. Eurofighter und Tornados - ebenfalls aus deutscher Koproduktion - sind im Jemen-Krieg zum Einsatz gekommen; die dortigen Luftschläge saudischer Piloten haben zahlreiche Zivilisten umgebracht und werden von Menschenrechtlern scharf kritisiert.[7] Saudi-Arabien wird auch mit den notwendigen Ersatzteilen für die europäischen Kampfjets beliefert, ohne die der Jemen-Krieg nicht geführt werden könnte.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.german-foreign-policy.com/news/detail/7823/">https://www.german-foreign-policy.com/news/detail/7823/</a></span></p> <p><span>and English version:</span></p> <p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p> <p><strong>The winding paths of arms export: Via South Africa to Saudi Arabia</strong></p> <p>In fact, the official decline in German arms exports is not only due to this year's special features, but also to the fact that German armorers have begun to diversify their production sites and organize sensitive exports through factories abroad. In mid-November, for example, a member of the Executive Board of Rheinmetall, the Düsseldorf-based armaments manufacturer, confirmed that his company supplies Saudi Arabia with war equipment worth more than 100 million euros a year via foreign subsidiaries.[2] This amount is not included in the Federal Government's Arms Export Report. Deliveries are handled via plants in Sardinia (Rheinmetall Waffe Munition Italia, RWM Italia) and South Africa (Rheinmetall Denel Munition, RDM).[3] The bomb factory in Sardinia is being expanded; the cooperation between RDM and Saudi Arabia is being intensified: SAMI (Saudi Arabian Military Industries), a relatively young Saudi defence group led by former Rheinmetall manager Andreas Schwer, acquires the South African Denel Group. In this context, he also aims to acquire Denel's 49 percent stake in RDM (<span><a href="http://german-foreign-policy.com/?fbclid=IwAR3_ShWqZpL_kh2JnwbhIZKOD6001xdMlVOORv7nroM4piE-9caylT3moRU">german-foreign-policy.com</a></span> reported [4]). SAMI itself has employed around a dozen German citizens, including at least three former Rheinmetall employees, to support the company in setting up its own weapons production facilities.[5] Unlike in the USA, for example, Germany allows the oral transfer of armaments know-how; this legal loophole enables the informal export of German weapons technology.</p> <p>Partner nations</p> <p>Products from German defence companies also reach Saudi Arabia via other European countries if they have been manufactured in jointly operated companies. This applies in particular to fighter jets. In March last year, Great Britain and Saudi Arabia agreed on the delivery of 48 Eurofighter aircraft. German armourers are involved in their manufacture. As the Federal Government confirms in a report to the Economic Committee of the Bundestag, "no partner nation prevents the sale or approval of the sale of products or systems of the programme to third parties"[6] The responsibility for the export of fighter jets can thus easily be shifted to Great Britain, which has already supplied the Eurofighters previously used by Saudi Arabia. Eurofighters and Tornados - also of German co-production - have been used in the Yemen war; the air strikes by Saudi pilots there have killed numerous civilians and are harshly criticised by human rights activists.[7] Saudi Arabia is also supplied with the necessary spare parts for the European fighter jets without which the Yemen war could not be waged.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/posts/2086264581426561">https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/posts/2086264581426561</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2> <p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p> <p><strong>Ministry of Health Reveals Epidemiological Situation in Yemen in 2018</strong></p> <p>The Yemeni Ministry of Health revealed a report showing the epidemiological situation in Yemen in 2018 and the prevalence of diseases.</p> <p>The Ministry reported that 2018 was a terrifying nightmare for people in Yemen who have been living in the throes of siege and aggression for 4 years.

Yemen’s dependence on imported goods is extremely high, the country’s arid climate is unforgiving for crops – the total domestic production of cereal crops only meets 20% of the country’s needs. And given this need for imports, it is no exaggeration to say that whoever controls Hodeidah controls the country’s future. Moreover, any damage to the port during a fight would have devastating consequences.<br /> Even before the current conflict Yemen was highly food insecure, importing close to 90 percent of the food the population eats. Hodeidah is the gateway for the majority of these imports and currently receives more than 70 percent of all the commercial and humanitarian goods arriving to the country — including food, fuel and medicine. <br /> UN agencies, humanitarian groups, and many others have pointed out that there is no viable way to make up for Hodeidah’s import capacity if the port shuts down, given that it has the largest offloading and storage facilities in the country, and is the closest major port to Yemen’s largest population centres."<br /> And it is not just damage to the port’s infrastructure that could spark starvation. <br /> Even if the port itself is not attacked, a siege of the city will likely force the port to close and thus sever this lifeline, aid agencies have been clear that even a brief disruption in deliveries, or the inability to access their storage facilities in Hodeidah, will put the lives of hundreds of thousands of people at risk. <br /> Similarly, if commercial food deliveries to Hodeidah are interrupted, shortages and price spikes will ensue on the local market. In a country enduring economic collapse because of war, this would leave huge swathes of the population unable to buy food."</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news522233.htm?fbclid=IwAR1MevWfDU0Uqg3oM4ITYj-DYlMn_mK74qSu0okgmzi4PriykcwDiERWAHc">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news522233.htm?fbclid=IwAR1MevWfDU0Uqg3oM4ITYj-DYlMn_mK74qSu0okgmzi4PriykcwDiERWAHc</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/posts/2087615654624787">https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/posts/2087615654624787</a></span></p> <p><span>Remark: From the Houthi side.</span></p> <p><span>(* A K pH)</span></p> <p>Armed Forces Spokesman: Mercenaries Escalate Violations in Hodeidah, Committing 276 Violations in 48 hours</p> <p>The spokesman of the Armed Forces, Brigadier General Yahya Sare'e, said that "the US-Saudi mercenaries have committed, 276 violations of the ceasefire agreement in Hodeidah, in the past 48 hours."

The Yemeni Army and Popular Committees have honored the agreement since the moment it was announced. The other party, represented by the US-Saudi Aggression and its mercenaries, has committed every possible action to violate this agreement.

In all, the coalition has accused the rebels of launching 313 attacks between December 18 and January 2, according to a report by Washington Institute issued on 08.01.2018.</p> <p>Only 59 of the Houthi violations (18.8%) took place in Hodeidah city versus 254 less visible attacks in rural areas south of the city. The rebels repeatedly struck the government’s main supply route near Tuhayta (62 attacks) and Duraymi (45 attacks), along with 80 attacks on coalition lines near al-Hays. While urban Houthi violations had dropped from 30 per day to 3 by January 2, rural violations increased from 8 per day to 24.</p> <p>The Army Forces backed by the coalition forces stated stated that they had been struck with mortars (usually 120 mm heavy mortars) 95 times as of January 2, along with 21 Katyusha rocket attacks and 4 howitzer attacks. A pair of Badr-1 heavy artillery rockets were reportedly fired at a coalition headquarters on December 21, a violation that would require the complicity of high-level commanders in charge of this strategic weapons system. The Houthis also reportedly mounted 55 attacks with 14.5 mm and 12.7 mm heavy machine guns, 12 with rocket-propelled grenades, 8 with 23 mm antiaircraft cannons, 4 with B-10 recoilless rifles, and 76 with sniper weapons and other gunfire.</p> <p>If the detailed coalition reports are accurate, the Houthis were violating the ceasefire with an average of 19.5 attacks per day as of January 2</p> <p><span><a href="https://republicanyemen.net/archives/13350">https://republicanyemen.net/archives/13350</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Status of implementation of Security Council resolution 2451 (2018) (S/2019/11)</p> <p>Report of the Secretary-General</p> <p>The present note is submitted pursuant to paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/2927899">2451 (2018)</a></span>, in which the Council requested the Secretary-General to report on progress regarding the implementation of the resolution, including any breaches of commitments by the parties, on a weekly basis, as called for by the parties, until further notice.

That’s why now the 15-member UN Security Council needs to take action on Guterres’ request by about Jan. 20, when a 30-day authorization for an advance monitoring team expires.</p> <p>Stated differently, despite the truce, the United Nations still remains desperately focused on one of its equally daunting undertakings: how to send more humanitarian aid to the besieged city of Hodeida.</p> <p><span>The horrific tally of the conflict’s devastation reflects only what we know. In reality, the situation is worse. UN agencies do not have full humanitarian access to some of the hardest hit communities - where there is no truce. In many, they cannot even assess their needs. All they say is that Yemen has passed the tipping point into a rapid decline from crisis to deepening catastrophe – all because the Saudis and their allies refuse to fully lift the illegal blockade everywhere.</span></p> <p>It should be clear by now that if UN aid agencies cannot gain greater access and the Saudi airstrikes do not subside, the cost in lives will be incalculable, not just in the Hodeida province but across other regions. To be sure, the Saudi-led blockade has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis that aid groups are calling the most severe in decades.</p> <p><span>At any rate, the truce still holds, Yemen needs truce monitors, and as per International Humanitarian Law, the UN Charter, and the laws of war: Saudi Arabia must respect the deal and open land, air and sea routes into Yemen.</span></p> <p>For one thing, The Hague should also hold the United States government to account because the US is still providing support to the Saudi bombing campaign and blockade all because the people of Yemen would never consent to be ruled by Saudi Arabia and the US. The UN Security Council should pass a resolution that says the US military is not authorized to assist Saudi Arabia as long as the truce holds.</p> <p><span><a href="http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13971019001162">http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13971019001162</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>IT’S TIME FOR A SERIOUS SAUDI-HOUTHI BACK CHANNEL</p> <p>Griffiths‘ […]goal — eventual peace negotiations that lay the foundation for a durable political settlement of Yemen’s catastrophic four-year civil war — are unlikely to meet the paramount objective that fueled the intervention by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the first place: ending Iranian influence in Yemen.

It is also this political ideology that creates a political — rather than religious — affinity for them with Iran. However, part of the movement and likely its leadership understands that a political accommodation with the great neighbor across the border is far more beneficial for the community’s ultimate survival than a relationship with a partner of convenience, physically distant and with few non-military resources to offer – by Barbara A.

The many children who have lost or been abandoned by parents have suffered the most, both physically and emotionally. Special correspondent Jane Ferguson reports on the devastating effects of the war from inside the country’s oldest orphanage.</p> <p>As the winter sun rises over Yemen's ancient capital, Sanaa, boys at this orphanage play soccer while they wait for their breakfast. When it comes, it's a humble meal, just lentils and bread. But it's hot, and they are happy to have it.</p> <p>The littlest boys eat separately, one of them sent to collect the bread each morning. The children break the bread together before it gets cooked on an outside stove with milk. It's not much, but, in this city, many children have much less.</p> <p>Dar Ri'ayat al-Aytam is the oldest orphanage in Yemen. It opened its doors to boys in 1925, and moved from Sanaa's ancient Old City to this spot in the 70s. Now around 400 boys call it home, some sent here by extended family, others abandoned by their destitute parents or taken in from the streets.</p> <p>Little Mohsin Douma's father was killed in Yemen's current, brutal civil war. He is 12 years old and arrived with two older brothers.</p> <p>Of all the different groups of people in Yemen, it is children who are by far the worst affected by this war.</p> <p>In the chaos and cruelty of Yemen's war, boys are being recruited to fight in it. The Houthi rebels have child soldiers as young as 11 in their ranks, according to the United Nations. Airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition have hit children, too, like the 40 killed last August when a coalition bomb was dropped on a bus full of little boys.</p> <p>And then there is the menace of starvation.

These items will be used to furnish a hospital in Yemen so that people do not have to travel outside the country for treatment.</p> <p>“I have been sending charity items to many countries for the past 11 years, however this is the first time I will be sending such a big consignment. Previously, I used to send clothes, dates and Q’uran. However, since 2017, I sent aid to Yemen five times and this is the third time I am sending medical assistance for them. We started on a very small-scale but gradually with time we have increased the number of items,” he said.</p> <p>People from all walks of life contributed to the cause. “While some gave blankets and food items there were many who even offered their house as a godown for the things to be stored. The Ministry of Health in Yemen has given us a list of immediate necessities and we are working to get them ready. I am also thankful to my team and other volunteers working with me on this project,” he said.</p> <p>Each truck will carry a load of 45 tonnes. It will take about three days to reach the country. Jadhami said he is also working with the Oman Charitable Organization to send the items.</p> <p>Those interested in donating can contact Nasr al Jadhami at 96687441.

Unfortunately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, there has been some violence, including in Hudaydah city, and in the southern districts of the governorate. However, this is remarkably limited compared to what we saw in the weeks before the Stockholm consultations.</p> <p>I am grateful for the commitment and patience that both parties have shown since Stockholm. Progress on some of the issues has been gradual and indeed somewhat tentative, but there is a tangible contribution to peace. There are, no doubt, many hurdles to be overcome in the days, weeks and months ahead, but I would say here that the parties must not be diverted from their commitments, through issues of delays or difficulties which were unexpected.</p> <p>I am under no illusion that these are very sensitive and challenging days for both parties and for Yemen as a whole. The war continues in other parts of the country, which is why we need to make progress quickly.</p> <p>I call on the Parties to recognize that these first steps need to be protected so that we can reach those other parts of the country in due course.</p> <p>It was unfortunate that we were unable to reach consensus on a way forward on the Central Bank of Yemen while we were together in Sweden and on the opening of Sana’a airport during those consultations in December. Both of these issues, if resolved, would make a significant contribution to relieving humanitarian suffering</p> <p>I should mention that as ever; the demands of southern groups are also a key part of the solution to the Yemeni equation. I am grateful for the effort exerted by key Yemeni stakeholders and the international community to improve stability in the southern governorates in recent months, which has been a remarkable achievement.</p> <p>To conclude, the message that I have been receiving particularly from the parties but also from key member states and those with interest in peace in Yemen, has been consistent in these past days and it is this: it is that we must implement what was agreed in Sweden and show substantial progress in those commitments if we are to build the confidence that we have hoped to create from them. There is a sense of tangible hope.</p> <p><span><a href="https://osesgy.unmissions.org/briefing-special-envoy-yemen-security-council">https://osesgy.unmissions.org/briefing-special-envoy-yemen-security-council</a></span></p> <p><span>film: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9PtvYR3ibM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9PtvYR3ibM</a> </span></p> <p><span>and also, in paraphrase, with film and audio, of Griffiths’ statement and also Marl Lowcock’s statement on the humanitarian situation: </span><span><a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1030112">https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1030112</a></span><span> and excerpts from Lowcock above, cp1)</span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p>Both sides largely sticking to Yemen ceasefire, more progress needed: U.N.</p> <p>Both sides in the conflict in Yemen have largely stuck to a ceasefire agreed last month, but substantial progress would be needed before more talks can be held on ending the war, the U.N. special representative to the country said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Martin Griffiths told the United Nations Security Council he had met the leaders of both sides in the conflict in recent days and both had expressed determination to find a way forward.</p> <p>He said while there had been some violence, it had been remarkably limited compared with in the lead-up to Stockholm.</p> <p>However, while there was a sense of tangible hope and optimism, there was also concern, Griffiths said, adding that he and the leaders of both parties shared the view that “substantial progress, particularly on Hodeidah, is something we would like to see before we reconvene the next consultations.”</p> <p>“I am still hopeful that we can proceed to a next round of consultations within the near future and I am working with both parties to make sure that that will happen at the earliest possible date,” he said.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-un/both-sides-largely-sticking-to-yemen-ceasefire-more-progress-needed-u-n-idUSKCN1P31ZE">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-un/both-sides-largely-sticking-to-yemen-ceasefire-more-progress-needed-u-n-idUSKCN1P31ZE</a></span></p> <p><span>and also </span><span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6573995/UN-seeks-substantial-progress-Yemen-talks.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6573995/UN-seeks-substantial-progress-Yemen-talks.html</a></span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p>Yemen peace deal: envoy upbeat despite UN-recognised government’s claims</p> <p>The envoy’s optimism was balanced by a call for greater momentum in implementing the agreement and an admission that substantial progress is needed for the next stage of the peace talks to proceed.

The domestic struggle for supremacy is inextricably linked to its international ramifications: Given the potentially enormous geopolitical consequences the prevention of an Iranian foothold on the Southern tip of the Arabian peninsula is by no means a goal of only Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The US should encourage such an outcome and exert pressure on the Saudi-led coalition by using America’s leverage as the supplier of ammunition, intelligence and air-refueling.

King Salman is believed to be in the early stages of dementia, and as time goes on, his condition surely worsens. Though Saudi officials continue to deny that the king’s health is in decline, recent episodes contribute to continued speculation regarding his mental state. King Salman’s speeches have become significantly shorter; his latest address to the kingdom lasted a mere eight minutes. Meetings with foreign dignitaries have also become more brief and less substantive.</p> <p>Perhaps the reason for the king’s lack of travel is more political in nature. King Salman’s last foreign trip was in October 2017, one month before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) led a shakedown of Saudi Arabia’s elites in the name of ending corruption. Given the fact that this move made enemies out of many of the kingdom’s most powerful, it may be that King Salman recognizes that should he leave the state, other members of the royal family may mobilize in an effort to remove the crown prince from the line of succession.</p> <p>The king’s presence also adds legitimacy to MBS’s policy decisions, both domestic and foreign. Conversely, perhaps the king chooses to remain in the kingdom in an effort to reign in the crown prince and keep him in check. For all of the attention MBS has received as the face of the kingdom’s recent reforms and policy decisions, it is clear that King Salman continues to have final say.

First of all, if a young woman who has been abused feels the need to seek asylum, becoming a refugee in a foreign country; it can only mean that the legal institutions in her own country provide insufficient support for female victims of domestic abuse. She could not, in other words, go to the police; she could not turn to social workers; she had no recourse whatsoever for protection with her own government. Domestic violence is a global issue; it occurs in every society in the world; but where else do women feel so devalued that the only way they can escape their abuser is to literally appeal to the United Nations for refugee status?</p> <p>While there have been PR campaigns in Saudi Arabia recently discouraging domestic abuse, there are absolutely no laws in the penal code that criminalise violence against women. Rahaf’s claims of abuse, then, should have been sufficient to prevent her deportation. Certainly, her declared renunciation of Islam puts her at risk of death and gives her a convincing argument for asylum; but as a woman in Saudi Arabia, it is legal for her family to abuse her, and the government could offer no guarantees of her safety.</p> <p>It is important to talk about the kingdom’s dismal position on religious freedom; everyone should have the right to choose their faith or choose not to have one.

Ein folgenschwerer Mordanschlag</p> <p>Das „neue“ Saudi-Arabien</p> <p>Der saudische Kronprinz MbS konnte mit einigen sozialen Reformen das Leben im Königreich deutlich verbessern – insbesondere das der saudischen Frauen –, während seine ambitionierte Vision 2030 das Land auch ökonomisch moderniseren soll. Diese hochgradig an seine Person gebundene Top-Down-Revolution steht und fällt mit dem Image des Prinzen, welches durh den brutalen Mord am Journalisten Jamal Khashoggi zerstört wurde und ultimativ wohl den Untergang des MbS eingeläutet hat.</p> <p>Ungeachtet seiner extremen Machtbündelung im Innern und der katastrophalen Konfrontationspolitik nach Außen gilt MbS gemeinhin als großer Reformer – der er zweifelsohne ist. Er repräsentiert eine Kaste junger kosmopolitischer Prinzen – und darüber hinaus junger Saudis im Allgemeinen –, die im Ausland studiert haben, dort lebten oder viel reisen und mit den verschiedensten kulturellen Eindrücken im Gepäck mit dem Ultrakonservatismus der saudischen Heimat nicht mehr allzu viel anfangen können.

Vor allem scheint mit MbS erstmals ein saudischer Führer tatsächlich ein gewisses Interesse an der Gunst seines Volkes zu haben.</p> <p>Neben diesen Verbesserungen kam es unter MbS andererseits zu einem massiven Anstieg <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/06/saudi-arabia-thousands-held-arbitrarily">willkürlicher Verhaftungen</a></span> ohne Anklage, sowie zu Vorbeugehaft potentieller Aktivisten und Einschränkungen der ohnehin spärlichen Rede- und Meinungsfreiheit.</p> <p>Ein weiterer zentraler Pfeiler dieser Top-Down-Revolution ist MbS‘ sogenannte <span><a href="https://www.dw.com/de/saudi-arabien-bastelt-an-seiner-zukunft/a-41120226">Vision 2030</a></span> – ein äußerst ambitioniertes Programm, nach dem sich die saudische Ökonomie langfristig von ihrer Ölabhängigkeit emanzipieren soll</p> <p>„Die wohl größte Herausforderung für Riad besteht darin“, <span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/920bed66-3364-11e8-ac48-10c6fdc22f03">analysiert</a></span> die Financial Times nüchtern, „das Amerika der Konzerne davon zu überzeugen, in Saudi-Arabien zu investieren und dringend benötigte Finanzmittel und technisches Know-how bereitzustellen, um die ehrgeizigen Pläne des jungen Prinzen zur Modernisierung seiner Nation zu unterstützen.“ Zu diesem Ziele brach MbS im vergangenen März zu einer <span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/mohammad-bin-salman-us-visit-itinerary-oprah-saudi-arabia-prince-google-trump-washington-dc-a8276751.html">dreiwöchigen Charmeoffensive</a></span> in die USA auf und traf sich in den Metropolen des Landes mit dem Who is Who der US-amerikanischen Eliten aus Politik, Wirtschaft, Öl-Business, Entertainment, Technologie und Medien.</p> <p>Insbesondere die US-Flaggschiffe der <em>liberal media</em> ließen sich seit jeher vom Charisma des MbS verzaubern – und hinters Licht führen –, sahen sie doch seit Beginn seines Aufstiegs krampfhaft in ihm nur das, was sie so gerne sehen wollten.</p> <p>Die Causa Khashoggi</p> <p>Und auch in Saudi-Arabien ist der Kampf gegen Kritiker <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/12/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-dissidents/">seit Jahrzehnten</a> fest in Historie und Struktur des Königreichs verankert.

He was the deputy editor of the <em>Arab News</em>; I was mentoring young reporters at that newspaper’s English-language competitor, the <em>Saudi Gazette</em>.</p> <p>By the time I met Jamal, in 2003, he had denounced bin Laden and written a column in the <em>Arab News</em>, placing the responsibility for 9/11 on the cultural failures of Saudi Arabia, especially Wahhabism, the kingdom’s unyielding state religion.</p> <p>He spoke of the “schizophrenia” that many Saudis experience, by which he meant the contradiction between what he called the “real” and the “virtual” kingdom. He gave the example of satellite dishes, which were nominally against the law. “In reality, we are the biggest consumers of satellite television in the Middle East,” he said.</p> <p>Jamal was the only Saudi I met who was in favor of the war in Iraq.

Again, Saudi Arabia tried to seize a Saudi citizen in a foreign country, and badly failed. Yes, the Saudis also had failed in the Khashoggi case, even though they had succeeded in seizing him. As for Rahaf, luckily there seems to be a “Happy End” now. In both cases, the PR debacle for Saudi Arabia was catastrophic, and this debacle largely predominated any achieved or just anticipated success. What did the Saudis really learn from the Khashoggi case? It seems that they did not learn very much, as the case of Rahaf is showing.</p> <p>Still, the Saudis think, they could chase and seize Saudi citizens in all countries on this globe. But it seems whether the world is going to change (partly thanks to social media as well), and the people affected, those in connection to them and worldwide public opinion simply will care more and more and will make their fate public.</p> <p>The Saudis seem still to act as being inebriated by the feeling of omnipotence, by the idea they would be able to bribe, or blackmail and bully states, organizations, media and individuals all around the world, so that they would stay either silent or would fulfill any Saudi wishes or would serve as Saudi mouthpieces. Thus, other cases like those of Khashoggi and Rahaf will happen, and other Saudi PR disasters are going to come. This is “Learning by doing”, when “Learning by brainpower” is rejected. A good advice: Simply let people go and let them alone, when they have succeeded in leaving the country.</p> <p>Well, in leaving a country, which is a kind of prison for at least half the population, with private guard(ian)s in every family. Every woman having escaped from this dystopic country must be accepted as a refugee. Certainly only by more cases like the Khashoggi and the Rafa cases coming under full public attention and scrutiny and by growing international pressure, any progress could be achieved.</p> <p>(* A P)</p> <p><span>Eine Frau twittert sich in die Freiheit</span></p> <p>Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun flüchtete vor ihrer Familie in Saudi-Arabien, doch thailändische Behörden setzten sie im Flughafen fest.

Al-Araibi claims he was imprisoned and tortured by Bahraini authorities amid a crackdown on athletes taking part in pro-democracy rallies during the Arab Spring, and he fled to Australia and sought asylum in 2011.</p> <p>In 2014 he was sentenced in absentia to 10 years’ jail at a Bahraini trial beset by claims of coerced confessions, ignored evidence and bias.

Al-Kunun erklärte, unter dem Schutz des UNHCR fühle sie sich nun sicher vor ihrer Familie.</p> <p>Nach Angaben der Menschenrechtsorganisation Human Rights Watch und ihrer eigenen Aussage war die 18-Jährige am Sonntag auf der Flucht vor ihrer Familie an Bangkoks internationalem Flughafen von saudiarabischen und kuwaitischen Botschaftsvertretern gestoppt worden, die ihr den Pass wegnahmen. Sie sei während einer Kuwait-Reise vor ihrer Familie wegen körperlicher und seelischer Misshandlungen geflüchtet, sagte al-Kunun.</p> <p>Die 18-Jährige wollte nach eigenen Angaben in Australien Asyl beantragen. Sie fürchtet, im Falle einer Abschiebung in ihr erzkonservatives Heimatland getötet zu werden.</p> <p>Thailands Einwanderungschef Surachate Hakparn hatte am Sonntag gesagt, al-Kunun sei die Einreise verweigert worden, weil sie nicht die notwendigen Dokumente bei sich gehabt habe. Nach vielfacher Kritik und Twitter-Appellen der jungen Frau an verschiedene Länder vollzog die Behörde am Montag eine Kehrtwende. "Wenn sie nicht ausreisen will, werden wir sie nicht zwingen", sagte Surachate zunächst.</p> <p>Nach einem Treffen mit UNHCR-Vertretern sagte der Behördenchef schließlich, die 18-Jährige dürfe bleiben.</p> <p>Das saudiarabische Außenministerium widersprach in einer über seine Botschaft in Bangkok veröffentlichten Erklärung der Angabe, dass der Pass der jungen Frau beschlagnahmt worden sei.

We had heard enough of any “American leadership” and do not want to hear anything else of the “American exceptionalism” bullshit. “American leadership” had brought chaos, destruction, permanent war, despair and killing to the Middle East (look at cp1 for instance), to Libya, to Vietnam and to Latin America. America just could help in Yemen by retreating: By retreating from any further interference, by retreating from any arms and spareparts supply to Saudi Arabia, by calling back all it’s technical staff from Saudi Arabia, by retreating from further political support. – And, again: The Iran narrative in a story related to Yemen simply is bullshit.</span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p><span>Concil on Foreign Relations: </span>The Top Conflicts to Watch in 2019: Yemen</p> <p>This year, a worsening of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen was included as a top tier priority in the Center for Preventive Action’s annual Preventive Priorities Survey.</p> <p>Of the thirty contingencies included in this year’s <span><a href="https://www.cfr.org/report/preventive-priorities-survey-2019">Preventive Priorities Survey</a></span>, a worsening of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, exacerbated by ongoing foreign intervention in the civil war, was assessed as a top tier priority for the United States in 2019.

But well-evidenced claims from the Yemeni government and Saudi-led coalition now suggest that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have racked up many ceasefire violations, including over 300 unprovoked attacks, the large-scale prohibited fortification of urban areas, and a failure to meet UN withdrawal deadlines. While the government and its allies have not retaliated, their patience is wearing thin.</p> <p>To save the fragile ceasefire, the United States should quickly investigate the coalition claims and, if substantiated, push the UN to send a stronger message to the Houthis—namely, that time is short, and the international community will view them as the defaulters on peace should the agreement collapse. Congress should then take note of all proven violations and signal that Washington may reassess its opposition to the Yemeni government’s forcible liberation of Red Sea ports.</p> <p>POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</p> <p>Convincing evidence presented to the UN indicates that the Houthis are flagrantly violating UN Resolution 2451, the Stockholm Agreement, and its subordinate Hodeida agreement. This is not a case of giving a ceasefire time to work: according to well-supported coalition claims, there were as many Houthi violations on January 1 as on December 22, and 7 times as many Houthi-caused casualties after the new year. This cavalier disregard for Resolution 2451 likely stems from the fact that the international community and the U.S. Congress have held the Houthis to a far lower standard of conduct than the Yemeni government and Gulf coalition. The initial days of the ceasefire seem to show that this double standard is harmful to the prospects for peace, and that while the coalition may be trusted to maintain the ceasefire, the Houthis seemingly cannot.</p> <p>The United States needs to work as an honest broker – by Michael Knights</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/protecting-yemens-peace-process-from-houthi-ceasefire-violations">https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/protecting-yemens-peace-process-from-houthi-ceasefire-violations</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: Both sides accuse each other of ceasefire violations (look at cp1b). Just taking the one side’s claims serious and not even mentioning those from the other side, is biased, the following will be propaganda. Claiming “</span>that the international community and the U.S. Congress have held the Houthis to a far lower standard of conduct than the Yemeni government and Gulf coalition” is even more than grotesque, when looking at the facts of this whole war. – “The United States needs to work as an honest broker “: The US is warring party in Yemen and thus never can “work as an honest broker “.</p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p>The Strategy Washington Is Pursuing in the Middle East Is the Only Strategy Worth Pursuing</p> <p>America needs to back up its allies (Israel, Saudi Arabia, and potentially Turkey), and isolate its adversaries (Iran, Russia, China, Islamic State). Everything else is secondary.</p> <p>The United States may lately have grown deeply skeptical of military action, but it retains a vital interest in building a stable order in the Middle East, if for no other reason than to keep the region’s worst pathologies at bay. In the Trump administration’s conception, three key obstacles stand in the way of an order amenable to American interests and to the interests of peace.</p> <p>The first is what might be called jihadistans, zones of chaos defined by failed states like Syria and Yemen. Offering no easy or immediate path to a better future, the jihadistans are problems that must nevertheless be somehow managed. The second is the problem posed by Sunni terror groups like al-Qaeda and Islamic State, which take root and prosper in the jihadistans. The third is the rise of Iran, which, abetted by Russia, is training and equipping Shiite militias based on the Hizballah model; these it deploys to project its power into at least four different Arab countries: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen.</p> <p>The administration seeks to contain both the Sunni terror groups and Iran simultaneously. If the deployment of American forces on the ground is the tool of last resort, and therefore to be avoided if at all possible, then the next best option—indeed, the only sensible option—is to work through allies.</p> <p>Last March, when the Senate first addressed the question of whether to punish the Saudis over Yemen, Lindsey Graham, who had not yet fallen victim to the moral panic, spoke judiciously. “The flaws of the Saudi government are real,” he said. “But my [Republican] friends on the other side . . . constantly put Saudi Arabia and Iran on the same footing. I think that is a very unwise analysis—to suggest that Saudi Arabia is just as bad as Iran is just missing the point big time.”</p> <p>The “big-time” point is this: an ally is a state that supports the American security system. Two questions should thus decide whether America treats a state as a friend or as a foe. Will the state actively help to defend that system against those—Russia, China, and Iran—who seek to weaken or destroy it? If it won’t take action, will it at least deny its territory and resources to America’s enemies?</p> <p>In the Middle East, if not in the world, these questions should take precedence. When an ally stumbles, we should help it to its feet. When our enemy stumbles, we should help keep it down and on the ground. Any consideration that subverts this elementary logic, no matter how “moral” it may appear on the surface, is fundamentally unsound. The choices in the Middle East are stark: either the United States will build a security system with its own military or with its allies’ militaries, or it won’t have one at all. In the absence of a viable security system, its moral influence in the world will decline significantly – by Michael Doran, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, former deputy assistant secretary of defense and a former senior director of the National Security Council.</p> <p><span><a href="https://mosaicmagazine.com/essay/2019/01/the-strategy-washington-is-pursuing-in-the-middle-east-is-the-only-strategy-worth-pursuing/">https://mosaicmagazine.com/essay/2019/01/the-strategy-washington-is-pursuing-in-the-middle-east-is-the-only-strategy-worth-pursuing/</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: This is a quite horrible example of “American exceptionalism”.</span></p> <p><span>“</span>The Strategy Washington Is Pursuing in the Middle East Is the Only Strategy Worth Pursuing”: ???? A strategy bringing 70 years of regime changes, wars, killing, destruction, despair, dictatorships, terrorism and chaos should be “the Only Strategy Worth Pursuing”???</p> <p><span>What matters is just America and its interests and absolutely nothing else, as already is told in the headline: “</span>Everything else is secondary”: Scores are being killed, everything is ruined, devastated, pushed into chaos. Doesn’t matter. The same to Iraq, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan… Doesn’t matter. US allies just are allies because they are useful to US interests. How horrific they might be: Doesn’t matter. But, remember: What is “US interests”? It’s not the interest of the jobless mother and the black nurse and the professor of archaeology and the bus driver and the dentist and the schoolboy and the pizza driver and the clergyman… it’s just the interest of the 0.1 % elite.</p> <p>What is the “American security system” which for the author is a value by itself? It’s a world order in which the US is controlling everything – in which the neoliberal capitalist order is secured, providing maximum profits to the US 0.1 % elite by exploiting labor forces and resources all over the world. Anyone who wants to change this would disturb this “American security system” and must be eliminated.</p> <p>Why anyone – apart from US 0.1 % oligarchs (350.000 people) = less than 0.05 % of the world population should think the author’s ideas to be reasonable? 99.95 % should not.</p> <p><span>For background, on the author: </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_Doran">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_Doran</a></span><span>; on Hudson Institute: </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute</a></span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>Saudi Arabia hosts 895,175 Yemeni, Syrian refugees as guests: KSRelief chief</p> <p>Royal Court Adviser and General Supervisor of the King Salman Center for Relief and Humanitarian Aid (KSRelief) Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, underscored the Kingdom’s leading role in humanitarian work and its commitment to the international humanitarian law, which corresponds to the teachings of Islam that call for the preservation of human dignity and sparing mankind suffering.</p> <p>He said the Kingdom has been showing utmost concern for the humanitarian situation in Yemen, sending aid to all Yemeni provinces, including areas controlled by the Houthi militia, through KSRelief programs.</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.arabnews.com/node/1095621/saudi-arabia">http://www.arabnews.com/node/1095621/saudi-arabia</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: Foreign workers are labeled as refugees here.</span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>Saudi Arabia Condemns Ongoing Houthi Violations against Sweden Deal</p> <p>Saudi Arabia stressed on Tuesday its efforts to support peace and stability in the Middle East, while condemning the Iran-backed Houthi militias’ ongoing violations in Yemen, reported the Saudi Press Agency.<br /> Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz chaired a cabinet session in Riyadh that reviewed the latest regional developments.<br /> Information Minister Turki al-Shabanah told SPA that the ministers condemned the Houthis for stalling in implementing the Sweden ceasefire agreement that was reached in December.<br /> This is blatant defiance of the international community, said the cabinet.</p> <p><span><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1537371/saudi-arabia-condemns-ongoing-houthi-violations-against-sweden-deal">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1537371/saudi-arabia-condemns-ongoing-houthi-violations-against-sweden-deal</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp16 Saudische Luftangriffe / Saudi air raids</span></h2> <p><span>(* A K pH)</span></p> <p><span>Saudi coalition air raids day by day</span></p> <p><span>Jan. 8: </span><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/pb.551288185021551.-2207520000.1547054637./1217464071737289/">https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/pb.551288185021551.-2207520000.1547054637./1217464071737289/</a></span></p> <p><span>Jan. 7: </span><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/pb.551288185021551.-2207520000.1546948533./1216739628476400/">https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/pb.551288185021551.-2207520000.1546948533./1216739628476400/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* A K pS)</span></p> <p>Five government soldiers killed in a "wrong” airstrike by Arab Coalition in Al-Jawf</p> <p>Five government soldiers were killed late Monday in an airstrike carried out by Saudi Arabia led coalition fighters in the northern province of al-Jawf.</p> <p>In his blog post on Facebook, al-Jouf governor councilor Saeed al-Mozaffari said that the air raid targeted their military site by mistake in the Alka'eef area in Khab Al-Sh’af directorate.</p> <p><span><a href="http://almasdaronline.com/articles/162940">http://almasdaronline.com/articles/162940</a></span></p> <p><span>(A K pH)</span></p> <p><span>More Saudi coalition air raids recorded on:</span></p> <p><span>Jan. 9: </span><span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news522142.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news522142.htm</a></span><span> Saada p.</span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp17 Kriegsereignisse / Theater of War</span></h2> <p>Siehe / Look at cp1b</p> <p>(* A K)</p> <p>Yemen's Houthi drones strike government military parade, several killed</p> <p>Houthi drones on Thursday attacked a Yemeni government military parade in Lahaj province, killing several people, Saudi and Houthi media reported.</p> <p>The parade was taking place inside a military base in al-Anad district when a loud explosion rocked the area, eyewitnesses said, adding high-ranked officials including Yemen’s deputy chief of staff were wounded in the attack.</p> <p>Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV said five were killed and several were injured.
