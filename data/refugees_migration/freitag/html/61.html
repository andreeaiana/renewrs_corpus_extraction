This demonstrates an increase of 399 videos from YouTube and 3,605 posts from Twitter since June 2019. Unfortunately, despite many documenting human rights violations, many of these videos have been <span><a href="https://yemeniarchive.org/en/tech-advocacy">made unavailable</a></span> for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Yet 24,242 YouTube videos and 70 Twitter posts remain unavailable as of July 2019. Some of these videos include attacks on refugee camps, attacks on hospitals and medical facilities, or destruction of civilian infrastructure. These 24,242 videos and 70 Twitter posts are securely preserved by Yemeni Archive and available upon request.</p><p>Yemeni Archive preserves content from 252 YouTube channels and 58 Twitter channels on a daily basis. This demonstrates an increase of 14 YouTube channels since June 2019. Of these, 16 YouTube channels and 9 Twitter channels have been made unavailable as of July 2019 but are preserved in Yemeni Archive infrastructure. Some of these channels are long-standing media houses that have been documenting human rights violations in Yemen since 2014.</p><p>Between June and July 2019, 3 YouTube channels that Yemeni Archive includes in its preservation activities have been made unavailable by YouTube. This demonstrates that the problem of platforms inadvertently removing from public view documentation of human rights violations is ongoing and has not ended.</p><p>Social media platforms have become accidental archives, but takedowns have proven they are no place for long-term, safe storage of materials depicting human rights violations. Alternate strategies must be used to archive this material, and Yemeni Archive seeks to fill this gap.</p><p>Get in touch if you or your media organisation has been affected by content takedowns on YouTube or other social media platforms or need assistance in securely archiving documentation materials.</p><p>Contact: <span><a href="mailto:info@yemeniarchive.org">info@yemeniarchive.org</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://yemeniarchive.org/en/tech-advocacy/july-takedowns.html">https://yemeniarchive.org/en/tech-advocacy/july-takedowns.html</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>Jemen: UN-Ermittler fordern Untersuchung von Kriegsverbrechen</strong></p><p>Im jemenitischen Bürgerkrieg werden UN-Ermittlern zufolge von allen Konfliktparteien Kriegsverbrechen begangen.

Ausdrücklich genannt werden in diesem Zusammenhang die Vereinigten Staaten, das Vereinigte Königreich, aber auch der Iran. Und an anderer Stelle ist zu lesen: „Mit der Anzahl von öffentlichen Berichten und oft begründeten schweren Verstößen gegen das humanitäre Völkerrecht kann kein Staat behaupten, sich nicht dessen bewusst zu sein, dass solche Verstöße im Jemen verübt werden.“</p><p>Eindeutig sind die Aussagen des UN-Berichts zu den US-Verbündeten Saudi-Arabien und Vereinigte Arabische Emirate: Ihnen werden Kriegsverbreche wie Mord, Folter, grausame und unmenschliche Behandlung, Vergewaltigung, die Rekrutierung von Kindersoldaten oder den Einsatz von Hunger als Waffe vorgeworfen. Kritisiert werden darüber hinaus auch Waffenlieferungen westlicher Staaten: „Die Rechtmäßigkeit von Waffenlieferungen durch Frankreich, das Vereinigte Königreich, die Vereinigten Staaten und anderer Länder bleibt fraglich und ist Gegenstand verschiedener innerstaatlicher Gerichtsverfahren.“</p><p><span><a href="https://zurzeit.at/index.php/un-bericht-mittaeterschaft-der-usa-an-kriegsverbrechen-in-jemen/">https://zurzeit.at/index.php/un-bericht-mittaeterschaft-der-usa-an-kriegsverbrechen-in-jemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen: Collective failure, collective responsibility – UN expert report</strong></p><p>Press Release, Group of International and Regional Eminent Experts on Yemen</p><p>A UN report on Yemen released on Tuesday details a host of possible war crimes committed by various parties to the conflict over the past five years, including through airstrikes, indiscriminate shelling, snipers, landmines, as well as arbitrary killings and detention, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, and the impeding of access to humanitarian aid in the midst of the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.</p><p>The Group of International and Regional Eminent Experts on Yemen, created by the UN Human Rights Council, found that the governments of Yemen and the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as well as the Houthis and affiliated popular committees have enjoyed a “pervasive lack of accountability” for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.</p><p>The report calls for the immediate cessation of all acts of violence committed against civilians in violation of applicable international human rights and international humanitarian law, and demands that the parties take action to protect civilians and ensure justice for all victims.</p><p>It urges other States to refrain from providing arms that could be used in the conflict, and reminds them of their obligation to take all reasonable measures to ensure respect for international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict.</p><p>“Five years into the conflict, violations against Yemeni civilians continue unabated, with total disregard for the plight of the people and a lack of international action to hold parties to the conflict accountable,” said Mr. Kamel Jendoubi, chairperson of the Group of Experts on Yemen.</p><p>“The international community must multiply its efforts to free the Yemeni people from the persistent injustice they have been enduring.”</p><p>Despite a lack of cooperation by the Coalition and Government of Yemen, the Group of Experts was able during the short time available this year to conduct more than 600 interviews with victims and witnesses, to examine documentary and open-source material, and to carry out investigations into emblematic cases to establish patterns of conduct indicative of alleged violations in Yemen since September 2014.</p><p>The Experts found reasonable grounds to believe that the conduct of hostilities by the parties to the conflict, including by airstrikes and shelling, continued to have an extreme impact on civilians and many of these attacks may amount to serious violations of international humanitarian law. The Experts further found reasonable grounds to believe that, in addition to violations related to the conduct of hostilities, the parties to the armed conflict in Yemen are responsible for arbitrary deprivation of the right to life, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, sexual violence, torture, ill-treatment, child recruitment, violations of fundamental freedoms, and violations of economic, social and cultural rights. These amount to violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as applicable. Subject to determination by an independent and competent court, many of these violations may result in individuals being held responsible for war crimes.</p><p>The Group of Experts has identified, where possible, individuals who may be responsible for international crimes, and an updated confidential list of individuals has been submitted to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Where identification of individuals was not possible, the Experts have identified the group responsible.</p><p>“This endemic impunity – for violations and abuses by all parties to the conflict – cannot be tolerated anymore. Impartial and independent inquiries must be empowered to hold accountable those who disrespect the rights of the Yemeni people. The international community must stop turning a blind eye to these violations and the intolerable humanitarian situation,” said Jendoubi.</p><p>The Group of Experts attributed direct responsibility to the parties to the conflict regarding the humanitarian situation in Yemen. The continued extreme impact of attacks against civilian infrastructure such as hospitals, water facilities, food transport, farms and market places, as well as the use of blockades and siege-like warfare, impeding humanitarian access, and other such measures have exacerbated the disastrous humanitarian situation.</p><p>“The inhumane deprivation of the Yemeni population of their rights to medicine, water and food should stop immediately. The very survival of the 24 million in need should be the first priority”, added Jendoubi.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24937&amp;LangID=E">https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24937&amp;LangID=E</a></span></p><p><span>and abridged versions: <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/09/1045492">https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/09/1045492</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/situation-human-rights-yemen-including-violations-and-abuses-september-2014-report">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/situation-human-rights-yemen-including-violations-and-abuses-september-2014-report</a></span></p><p><span>and film: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEsX7ewuB4w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEsX7ewuB4w</a></span></p><p>and a long thread by Kristine Beckerle (HRW) emphasizing important points:</p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/K_Beckerle/status/1168843545781899264">https://twitter.com/K_Beckerle/status/1168843545781899264</a></span></p><p>and summarizing reports by the press</p><p><span><a href="https://apnews.com/ac80c7d3107e4af180638b2a75859ab9">https://apnews.com/ac80c7d3107e4af180638b2a75859ab9</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/france-britain-complicit-yemen-war-crimes-190903103122355.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/france-britain-complicit-yemen-war-crimes-190903103122355.html</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7422329/UN-probe-alleges-war-crimes-endemic-impunity-Yemen.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7422329/UN-probe-alleges-war-crimes-endemic-impunity-Yemen.html</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-un/u-s-france-britain-may-be-complicit-in-yemen-war-crimes-u-n-report-says-idUSKCN1VO11B">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-un/u-s-france-britain-may-be-complicit-in-yemen-war-crimes-u-n-report-says-idUSKCN1VO11B</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/459679-un-us-allies-may-be-complicit-in-yemen-war-crimes">https://thehill.com/policy/defense/459679-un-us-allies-may-be-complicit-in-yemen-war-crimes</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/03/uk-us-and-france-may-be-complicit-in-yemen-war-crimes-un-report">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/03/uk-us-and-france-may-be-complicit-in-yemen-war-crimes-un-report</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/us-britain-france-abetting-possible-war-crimes-in-yemen-says-un-report-1.597062">https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/us-britain-france-abetting-possible-war-crimes-in-yemen-says-un-report-1.597062</a></span></p><p>My comment: The headlines of Western media just emphasize this point, as example „The Guardian“, the others with little differences only: „UK, US and France may be complicit in Yemen war crimes – UN report“. Yes, pals, the world knew this since more than 4 years.

First, as usual with all Western human rights organizations, and as usual with the United Nations reports when it comes to war crimes and human rights violation by countries that are loyal to the US, notice the qualified language. If this is Iran or Syria, you would find countries that are not aligned with the US. You would find the categorical language about certain war crimes have occurred in this region and that conflict and so on. We find here a very mild language that is not certified. The second point about that is, as usual in, again, Western human rights organizations as well as UN reports about human rights violations by countries that are allied with the US and Israel, we find that the propensity is always to blame both sides. The victims have to be blamed.</p><p>The victims here are the people of Yemen. First of all, if you go to WikiLeaks, the Houthis is an own Indigenous movement in South Yemen. They have their own agenda. They did not have any regional ambitions or even associations. In WikiLeaks, it said that all of the news in Gulf countries regarding this association with Iran are highly exaggerated. It is fair to say that it is the war of aggression by Saudi Arabia and UAE and the US on Yemen, that it has pushed the Houthis into the lap of Iran. They felt they had no choice.</p><p>In that context, if you want to argue who has been responsible, first for the ignition of this war, and two, for the prolongation of this war, there is no question why there are two sides fighting and why there have been human rights violations by the Houthis. The responsibility, the bulk of responsibility, should be laid on the blame of those who started the war and who have prolonged the war, and that is Saudi Arabia, UAE and the sponsors in the West, along with Israel on their side.</p><p><span><a href="https://therealnews.com/stories/un-report-on-yemen-us-uk-accomplices-to-atrocities-while-inaction-continues">https://therealnews.com/stories/un-report-on-yemen-us-uk-accomplices-to-atrocities-while-inaction-continues</a></span></p><p>and film of interview: <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-YkmUoVHY4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-YkmUoVHY4</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><span>(* A P)</span></p><p>Saudi-led coalition rejects U.N. report on Yemen</p><p> Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement on Thursday dismissed as subjective and biased a United Nations report that called for a ban on arms transfers to Yemen’s warring sides.</p><p>“The report was based on a number of inaccurate assumptions by the U.N. experts ... which stripped it of objectivity and impartiality,” said a statement published by the Saudi state news agency, SPA.</p><p>The coalition said it would provide a “comprehensive and detailed legal response” at a later time.

These assessments are the product of in-depth open-source analysis focusing on alleged Saudi-UAE airstrikes that have occurred in Yemen since the start of the aerial bombardment campaign on the 25th of March 2015. They can be read in full at the Yemen Project <a href="http://yemen.bellingcat.com/">website</a>.</p><p>Bellingcat’s investigations comprise review and verification of all available information in the public domain related to the incidents, including photographs, videos, satellite imagery and Arabic language social media posts discovered by their investigators. Through these reports, Bellingcat has drawn attention to a strategy of targeting densely populated locations by the Saudi-UAE led coalition in both Houthi and non-Houthi held territory. These investigations highlight a destructive pattern of attacks by the Saudi-led Coalition on densely populated markets, prisons, weddings and funerals in Yemen, leaving little to no accountability or acknowledgement in their wake.</p><p>Methodology<br /> The methodology followed by the investigators was designed in collaboration with lawyers at the Global Legal Action Network. It was created to increase the reliability of the information in the event that it is ever used as evidence in a court of law. It includes the use of technology which records all steps taken by the investigators to find evidence and immutably preserves the content relied on in the reports. Investigators are briefed on the core principles of international humanitarian law in order to inform their factual assessments, and all reasonable lines of inquiry are followed, including those which point to military activity in the vicinity of an attack which may explain an airstrike in favour of the attacker.<br /> “Double-tap” airstrikes on markets</p><p>From the set of 20, Bellingcat has investigated eight alleged airstrikes on markets in Yemen. Seven of these occurred during daylight hours, when markets are most likely to be crowded. Using open-source information, researchers were unable to identify military targets in many of the strikes investigated in this cluster, calling into question the legitimacy of the attacks. However, even in light of identified military targets, the attacks on these locations appeared to kill and injure far more civilians than was proportionate to any likely military advantage. In some cases, such egregious civilian harm appears entirely foreseeable, suggesting that members of the Coalition have intentionally conducted indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks. </p><p>Accountability</p><p>In addition to markets, the coalition has demonstrated an alarming disregard for civilians by repeatedly targeting heavily populated areas such as large gatherings at weddings and funerals across the country. Detention centres have also not been spared, causing the deaths of dozens of detainees. On the 12th of May 2015, a building in Hajjah later identified by Bellingcat researchers using videos from 2009 and 2013 as a detention center, was <a href="http://yemen.bellingcat.com/investigations/haj-10005-the-abs-prison-strike">bombed</a>. This represented the first of a pattern of strikes where the coalition had struck prisons that were still operational. </p><p>The Joint Incident Assessment Team (JIAT), a body established and run by the Saudi/UAE-led coalition in 2016 in response to claims of potential IHL violations, has been roundly condemned as ineffectual by Human Rights Watch and the United Nations Group of Eminent Experts. Bellingcat’s investigations support those condemnations.</p><p>Ally responsibility <br /> Fuelling the conflict with arms, coalition allies the UK and the US have committed to billions worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE since the start of the conflict. Despite providing such immense military support, the UK and US have both neglected to independently investigate claims of international humanitarian law violations and potential war crimes, even where their arms have been directly tied to these incidents. This disregard for accountability has had devastating and far-reaching consequences on the civilian population in Yemen. The international community’s continued supply of arms without qualification to the Saudi and UAE governments has enabled the coalition’s repeated failure to push for accountability for violations of international law. As a consequence, failure to acknowledge civilian harm over the course of the conflict, has led to the continuation of airstrikes in densely populated areas.<br /> In the UK, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) has <a href="https://www.caat.org.uk/campaigns/stop-arming-saudi">challenged</a> the government’s decision licence the export of military equipment to Saudi Arabia. On 20 June 2019 the Court of Appeal ruled that UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen are unlawful, however, despite overwhelming evidence and clear risk that UK weapons could be used in unlawful strikes, the UK government has appealed and is yet to make a decision on whether it will grant further arms licenses for sales to Saudi Arabia. Of significance to the government’s new decision will be the steps the Coalition has taken to address alleged violations. Based on Bellingcat’s investigations, such steps appear to have been purely token in nature and only forthcoming in response to overwhelming international outrage. <br /> Bellingcat will continue to investigate airstrikes and will post further tranches of incidents in the coming months.

The 1990 unification of Yemen’s north and south, the 1994 civil war and the decades of disenfranchisement that followed for southerners left open wounds that justifiably fed aspirations for a return to independence. However, traditional leaders of the southern cause — many hailing from South Yemen’s Marxist era — lost their moral high ground in August, when they bit their tongues as Hani bin Breik, a ruthless religious zealot bent on purging northerners from Aden, became the face of southern empowerment.</p><p>Bin Breik is a militant Salafi extremist whose affinity for stirring sectarian hatred and social divisions rivals that of Qasim al-Raimi, the head of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and the leader of the armed Houthi movement, Abdelmalek al-Houthi.</p><p>Notably, Bin Breik’s men were armed with American-made weapons paid for by the UAE and politically supported by western lobbyist firms such as Independent Diplomat and Quatro. Abu Dhabi’s support for Bin Breik and many other similarly unsavory characters in Yemen – such as the Salafi militia leader Abu al-Abbas in Taiz, who is designated as a supporter of terrorism by the U.S. Treasury – is telling of its unscrupulous approach to the war and its disregard for Yemeni sovereignty. In a purely functional sense though, Abu Dhabi has at least empowered local proxies that have a plausible chance of achieving its desired ends, regardless of how immoral or illegal those ends might be. By contrast, Riyadh threw its lot behind one of the most corrupt and incapable statesmen in recent history, Yemeni President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi.</p><p>The Saudi leadership’s typical approach to problem-solving is to essentially throw money at something until it goes away. But no matter how many billions of dollars worth of weapons Riyadh has bought to bomb Yemen, it must be appallingly clear by now that this is akin to throwing cash off of a cliff and hoping to fill the ocean. At the heart of why this spending and bombing has been futile is the Yemeni president. Hadi is not the one making the most money from this war – far from it – but he occupies the most important decision-making post of any Yemeni. And yet, as a decision-maker, he is inept. T</p><p>In August, the Saudi narrative, as well as the legal basis for its intervention in Yemen, unraveled. United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2216, passed in April 2015, highlighted the Yemeni government’s request that Gulf countries assist in its return to power. The Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition has claimed this document offers legal legitimacy for their military intervention in Yemen. This claim is now preposterous. The UAE is actively supporting a military front against the Yemeni government. </p><p>Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, once big brother and little brother, have lost their fraternity in Yemen’s burial grounds. Their money did not buy a quick victory, but four years on, it is still paying to fill more Yemeni graves.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/66061/yemen-where-coalitions-come-to-die/">https://www.justsecurity.org/66061/yemen-where-coalitions-come-to-die/</a></span><span> = <a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/8040">https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/8040</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>What An End To Yemen’s Conflict Will Mean For The Houthis</strong></p><p>Until very recently, the Houthis have largely been portrayed as a disorganized rebel group whose only expertise is in guerrilla warfare. With each passing year of the conflict, the Houthis have demonstrated that they are, in fact, a politically shrewd organization that makes calculated decisions about its public messaging and diplomatic relations. The Houthis have assembled a Sanaa-based government mirroring the internationally recognized Yemeni government, and they strive to project an air of legitimacy by carefully curating their public image and securing meetings with <span><a href="http://www.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=44198&amp;cat_id=3">diplomats</a></span> around the globe.</p><p>The movement’s propaganda and history also indicate that the Houthis are an adaptable group that seeks out partnerships with neighboring adversaries—sometimes by blaming the actions of their opponents on Western actors.</p><p>The Houthis practically absolve their regional rivals of their role in the conflict by repeatedly emphasizing that Western actors are the ones engineering Yemen’s destruction.</p><p>Just like they did with the late president Saleh, the Houthis insist that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are only acting upon the orders of the United States, implying that their Arab neighbors are not malicious, but are being misled.</p><p>The Houthis have said explicitly that they are willing to <span><a href="http://www.alhudhud.net/?p=55784">open a dialogue</a></span> with both the UAE and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The potential for communication or cooperation between the Houthis and members of the coalition is rarely addressed, possibly because of a fixation among analysts on the group’s current support from Iran, which is frequently emphasized—and overstated. However, it is unlikely that the Houthis will remain closely aligned with the Islamic Republic after the current conflict comes to a close. The Houthis surely understand that it is the UAE and Saudi Arabia, not Iran, that will be funding the bulk of Yemen’s post-conflict reconstruction, and the two countries will therefore possess political leverage that is beyond Iran’s capabilities.</p><p>Likewise, Iran is not inclined to maintain the same level of support for the Houthis after the war ends. Tehran’s investment in Sanaa is not like that in Beirut or Damascus, where Iran has long-standing and critical interests. It is widely accepted that Yemen is simply not that high on Iran’s list of priorities</p><p>It is unpalatable to acknowledge that the Houthis are likely to come out of this conflict as one of the most powerful political actors in northern Yemen—they have committed innumerable atrocities and human rights violations, and their rhetoric is conspiratorial and blatantly anti-Semitic. The Houthis are a corrupt and deeply militarized group, but they crave political legitimacy from their neighbors and regional actors, and are willing to make sacrifices to achieve it. Ending the international military conflict may lead them to adopt other approaches, create new alliances, and cooperate with former foes.

Amnesty International has described it as the “forgotten war.” Coverage of the conflict, which has raged for five years and has precipitated one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history, has been sporadic and simplistic. </p><p>It is, admittedly, a complex story—one that requires a nuanced understanding of the cultures and the political currents of a whole region.</p><p>Local journalists are routinely targeted with smear campaigns, run by both the Saudi coalition and the Houthis, on social media, says Radhya Almutawakel, a human rights advocate and the chairperson of Mwatana for Human Rights, a Yemeni human-rights group</p><p>Foreign reporters face other issues. When Iona Craig, an independent journalist, began covering the Yemen uprising in 2011, she recalls, access was a rare commodity. It remains unpredictable and arbitrary. </p><p>Foreign journalists remain caught between the Houthi-controlled north and the Saudi-coalition forces in the south and need to get permission from both parties if they want to enter the country. “It is effectively two countries as far as getting visas,” Craig says. </p><p>But most journalists peg the recent spike in coverage of Yemen to the October 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The killing ignited a public debate and scrutiny of Saudi actions within the US. </p><p>For all the chaos in this years-long war, says Maggie Michael, an Associated Press reporter, Houthis still push stories to journalists about the humanitarian cost of the conflict. Saudi-coalition forces push information on child soldiers said to be used by the Houthis—and push back at allegations surrounding <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/yemen/">torture prisons</a>. </p><p>Michael, who won a Pulitzer Prize this year for her coverage of the war, says that ultimately, the conflict reflects the essential dilemma faced by every journalist: “You are given different versions of the truth, and your job is to dig deep to reveal what it really is.” </p><p><span><a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/yemen-war.php">https://www.cjr.org/analysis/yemen-war.php</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P T)</strong></p><p><strong>Islamic State weapons in Yemen traced back to US Government: Serbia files (part 1)</strong></p><p>While US President Donald Trump boasts about the defeat of Islamic State in Syria, US government-purchased weapons appear in the hands of Islamic State terrorists in Yemen.</p><p>Recently I anonymously received explosive documents from the Serbian state-owned arms companies Krusik and Jugoimport SDPR, including e-mails, internal memos, contracts, photos, delivery schedules, and packing lists with lot numbers of weapons and their buyers. Among the leaked documents I also received scanned passports of arms dealers and government officials from the US, Saudi Arabia and UAE. They have been involved in the trafficking of at least 3 million pieces of Serbian weapons (mortar shells and rockets) to Yemen and Syria in the last three years.</p><p>Tracking the lot number of these Serbian weapons I was able to identify and trace mortar shells in the hands of Islamic State terrorists in Yemen back to their buyer – the US Government.</p><p>These documents expose the biggest lie in the US foreign policy – officially fighting terrorism while secretly supporting it.</p><p>On 27 July 2019 the Islamic State group released a propaganda video featuring its branch in Yemen. The video shows barbaric scenes of atrocities including shocking scenes of beheadings of people kept in captivity by the Islamic State in Yemen. One 5-second frame shows weapons purchased by the US government in the hands of the terrorists. Here is how I discovered that. The mark on the mortar shells is clearly visible – 82 mm M74 HE KV lot 04/18. The two letters KV mean that those mortar shells were manufactured by the Serbian arms factory Krusik (K stands for Krusik and V – for Valjevo, the town where the factory is located). The following digits 04/18 mean that the mortar shells are lot 04, produced in 2018.</p><p>As I had already had documents about arms exports from Krusik I was able to trace back this particular lot 04/18.

SAM highlights the issue of Yemeni Fighters in Southern Saudi Arabia</strong></p><p>SAM Organization for Rights and Liberties, has issued a report entitled “Border Incineration” highlighting the issue of attracting Yemeni civilians, including children, and some former Yemeni military and former military personnel to fight in the southern border of Saudi Arabia without legal cover.</p><p> Saudi Arabia is hiring Yemeni fighters through human trafficking networks involving Saudis and Yemenis, including former officers and officers of the Yemeni army; SAM said.</p><p>In its report, SAM concluded that thousands of Yemenis who had to go to fight to defend the Saudi border, under the pressure of poor humanitarian conditions and subsequently killed or injured, were treated by Saudi Arabia as if they do not exist.</p><p>The report, issued by SAM, said it was an outcome of research and investigation in which the organization tried to answer questions about the facts of recruitment and the circumstances of the war to which they are led. Witnesses included officers who were closely involved in the recruitment process, including wounded and former recruits, including recruits who testified and returned to the fronts to die.</p><p>SAM concluded in the report that “what is happening at the border is a violation of domestic laws and international conventions, which prohibit the exploitation of civilians to fight with a country, outside the jurisdiction of local military laws, so as not to protect their future rights as formal fighters. Although Saudi Arabia gives them identification numbers as soldiers and some military ranks, the reality reached through the field investigation by SAM researchers confirms that they were only “imaginary” soldiers and officers, especially since they do not have any permanent rights resulting therefrom, following their death in the battles.</p><p>According to “SAM” some fighters enter Saudi territory from Al-Wade’a land port using emergency travel document provided by the Yemeni consulate, and they fight in the southern border of Saudi Arabia and receive salaries irregularly, and each time they get paid, they also get a fictitious ranks, based on which their salaries are estimated, and in subsequent payroll list the rank can be promoted or demoted. When they request a leave, they are treated at the Saudi port as if they were illegal immigrants, the Saudi authorities register their fingerprints electronically, then they are banned from entering the Kingdom, even if they get an official visa.</p><p>According to SAM’s report, thousands of Yemeni victims killed in battles to defend Saudi Arabia’s southern border were buried in tombs inside the kingdom without the knowledge of their families, and few of them, their family have been able to enter Saudi Arabia to receive their bodies and bury them. Others, their families are still unaware of their fate and fear they have been killed in unknown areas.</p><p>SAM said in the report that at least 300 Yemeni fighters have been amputated, 250 of whom are currently in a housing in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia, as well as others in other provinces and camps, most of them awaiting surgery, for installing prosthetics before returning to Yemen, while most of them are living in difficult psychological and humanitarian conditions because their salaries have been suspended for seven months.</p><p>SAM called to stop what is called the “Incineration” of Yemeni youth, who are pushed to join the fight by difficult economic conditions, in light of salary cuts and suspension of development projects, and the poor humanitarian situation of the displaced and unemployment, and by brokers persistence to trade the lives of Yemenis in exchange for money</p><p>SAM said that the conclusion of the legal research into the status of these fighters confirms that they cannot be described as mercenaries, although they fight alongside Saudi Arabia motivated primarily by financial temptation, which means that one of the conditions for the description of mercenaries fits on them, but they cannot be considered as mercenaries, because they belong to a State party to the ongoing conflict, Yemen, which disqualify them from the description of mercenaries, where the mercenary is required, either as defined in Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions or in the International Convention against the Recruitment and Use of Mercenaries And their funding, “to not be Nationals of a Party to the conflict or of residents of territory under the control of a Party to the conflict.</p><p> According to “SAM,” these recruits could be considered a “Yemeni militia” working for and funded by Saudi Arabia, and therefore; it is responsible for them or for any violations committed by them as it oversees their training and salaries and the appointment of their commanders and direct their operations.</p><p>SAM also quoted witnesses as saying that these forces are engaged in some battles with the participation of the air cover of the Coalition, but sometimes the Coalition bombs the sites of the forces loyal to Saudi Arabia, and by artillery and the tanks also, who made some mistakes and caused casualties.</p><p>SAM said it had not been able to get an accurate statistic of the numbers of wounded from official sources; but according to estimates from field fighters, there have been approximately 10,000 wounded since the beginning of the war. “Our information indicates that many of the Yemeni war-wounded fighting in the Yemen-Saudi border do not receive the necessary care,” SAM said. “Many of them were forcibly deported to a newly constructed accommodation in the Yemeni province of Mareb, while some were granted compensation, sometimes only SAR 500. The organization also found that many of the wounded were in a bad psychological situation and complained of ill-treatment.</p><p>SAM said that it received information that some Yemeni fighting to defend Saudi Arabia’s southern border were subjected to arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances in Saudi intelligence prisons for long periods, which could last from six months to an unknown period, before being deported to Mareb, Yemen.</p><p><a href="https://www.samrl.org/yemeni-fighters-in-southern-saudi-arabia/">https://www.samrl.org/yemeni-fighters-in-southern-saudi-arabia/</a></p><p><span>And this is the full SAM report:</span></p><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>Incineration of the Border</strong></p><p><span>Human rights report monitors recruitment of Yemeni civilisan fighters to defend Saudi Arabia’s southern border</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.samrl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Recruitment-of-Yemenis-in-Saudi-Arabia-EN.pdf">https://www.samrl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Recruitment-of-Yemenis-in-Saudi-Arabia-EN.pdf</a></span></p><p><span>and special subjects taken from this report:</span></p><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>'I curse myself': Yemeni mercenaries say their Saudi fighting days are over</strong></p><p>The war took their jobs from them, so they fought for the Saudis. Now Yemen's mercenaries have had enough</p><p>Anees was able to send around $1,200 back to his family each month and continued to fight until this April, when he went home for a visit. In May, he returned to the Saudi-Yemen border once again, even though he sensed it could be his last trip home.</p><p>"I was feeling that maybe this was my final visit to my village. The battles were getting fiercer and the Saudis were sending us to the front lines while they keep far from the battles," he said.</p><p>Four months later - and days after he says Saudi Arabia put more than 1,000 mercenaries like him in a vulnerable position at the kingdom’s border, where they were besieged by the Houthis for four days – the 43-year-old and relatives of those killed during the siege are calling on fighters to desert their paymasters.</p><p>“I am cursing myself every day for joining the battles with Saudi Arabia to defend its borders from the Houthis. But it was not only my mistake. It was also the bad economy that made us do it,” he said.</p><p>Last week, Anees said, the leaders of his brigade called on their fighters to march on the Jabara Valley, an area in the Ketaf district of Saada province.</p><p>“We know this valley is under Houthi control and that the Houthis were also positioned behind us in Najran,” Anees said.</p><p>But the leaders insisted that the mercenaries press forward, promising that Salafi fighters would follow from behind and protect them.</p><p>More than 1,000 Yemeni fighters advanced to the valley, which was empty when they arrived, Anees said. They then marched about 1.5km around the valley and still, he said, there were no Houthis in sight. But it was a trap.</p><p>“Suddenly, the Houthis started to attack us from the mountains. We tried to withdraw but there were no Salafi fighters backing us up and only the Houthis besieging us from all directions,” he said.</p><p>Anees said the siege started on Monday and lasted until Thursday, without any intervention from Saudi Arabia or the Salafis. Eventually, some of the fighters broke through and fled.</p><p>“We were about to die from hunger. We had run out of food. The Saudis and the Salafis did not break the siege on us, so we fought and pushed towards Najran and only few were escaped including me,” Anees said.</p><p>He said he was among fewer than 100 fighters who escaped the battle, while more than 1,000 were either killed or captured, he said.</p><p>According to these reports, around 800 fighters are from Taiz, 600 from Ibb, 300 from Al-Jawf and 200 from Dhamar province were captured in Ketaf and then the captives were transported to different prisons.</p><p>The accounts also stated that one of the vehicles transporting the captured soldiers, which was far from the area where the siege and fighting had happened, was hit by a Saudi air strike, killing and injuring a large number.</p><p>Mohammed Al-Boukhaiti, a Houthi leader and member of the Houthis’ Political Council, said on <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AE%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%8A-Mohammed-Al-Bukaiti-1405747299720220/">his Facebook account</a></span> that all the details in the pro-Hadi reports were true.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has not commented publicly on the battle and did not respond to MEE's request for comment on Tuesday.</p><p>“We were about to die from hunger, but Saudi Arabia did not intervene to break the siege with air strikes because the Saudis do not care about us,” Anees said.</p><p>“I call on all Yemeni fighters in the Saudi borders to return to their homes and let the Houthis advance on Saudi Arabia and take revenge for the deaths of our fellow fighters."</p><p>Sadness in all the houses</p><p>The scale of loss from the fighting and siege in the mountains has shaken households across Yemen, particularly in Taiz province, where many of the paid fighters came from.</p><p>“I lost 27 friends from my small village in the outskirts of Taiz City and only two fighters from my village could escape,” said Anees, who escaped by fleeing towards Najran and was only making his way back home on Saturday.</p><p>“The Saudis launched a war on us and our men lost their jobs because of the war. Then Saudi Arabia opened the door for Yemenis to defend its borders,” Aisha Sharaf, the mother of a 26-year-old mercenary, told MEE.</p><p>“The men and youth had no choice but to fight for Saudi Arabia to get money that enabled them to marry and help their families.”</p><p>Mercenaries or soldiers?</p><p>Reacting to the news of the battle, the Yemeni government responded without clarifying that the Yemeni fighters who were killed were mercenaries, rather than soldiers with the army.</p><p>The Yemeni defence ministry<span><a href="http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/31/vice-president-praises-armys-struggle-in-kataf/"> reported</a></span> that vice president Ali Mohsen Saleh <span><a href="http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/31/vice-president-praises-armys-struggle-in-kataf/">phoned</a></span> General Raddad al-Hashimi, commander of the Ketaf Brigade, on Friday to follow up on military developments and the condition of the fighters.</p><p>“Saleh praised heroes’ legendary resilience in fighting Houthi militia in Sa’ada’s Kataf, praying for the dead soldiers and praying for recovery of the injured and wounded,” the ministry’s website said.</p><p>Saleh also reportedly “expressed thanks to Saudi brothers” for their efforts to liberate Yemen from the Houthis.</p><p>The fugitive fighter Anees accused the government of being “the worst problem in Yemen”.</p><p>Returning home</p><p>The battle has also sparked others to call for mercenaries fighting for Saudi Arabia in Yemen to return home.</p><p>Soon after the fighting, <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/fr/news/yemen-war-teen-warlord-taiz-fear-al-mekhlafi-95770585">Sheik Hamoud Al-Mikhlafi</a></span>, head of the Popular Resistance in Taiz and now based in Turkey, <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hamoodsaeed20/">said on his Facebook</a></span> account: “We call on all fighters of Al-Janad region [Taiz and Ibb provinces] in the southern borders of Saudi Arabia return quickly to the battles in Taiz.” </p><p>Now that Arees is home, he is encouraging other fighters to return, but says he knows it is a difficult ask.</p><p>“Many Yemeni fighters in other fronts in the Saudi borders are demanding to return to their cities after they witnessed the treason of Salafis but the Saudis did not allow them to flee the battles,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, with some of the money he has left from his fighting, he will try to support his family by selling sandwiches at a nearby school.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/i-curse-myself-everyday-yemeni-mercenaries-say-their-saudi-fighting-days-are-over">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/i-curse-myself-everyday-yemeni-mercenaries-say-their-saudi-fighting-days-are-over</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>Report: Saudi Arabia using human trafficking networks to recruit child soldiers</strong></p><p>Saudi Arabia has been taking advantage of the dire economic condition in neighbouring Yemen by recruiting Yemeni civilians, including children, via local human trafficking networks to defend its southern border, a new report has revealed.</p><p><span><a href="about:blank">According</a></span> to Geneva based human rights monitoring organisation SAM, many Yemenis are entering the kingdom under the pretext of receiving emergency treatment only to be sent to the Yemen-Saudi border to fight for Riyadh. Saudi classes such fighters as mercenaries, however SAM explains this cannot be the case as they belong to a state party in the ongoing conflict.</p><p>Over the last four years, the report explained, Saudi Arabia has been enlisting thousands of Yemeni fighters, <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190711-yemens-houthis-recruit-30000-child-soldiers-minister/">including children</a></span>, “using human trafficking networks, to fight on its behalf along its southern border with Yemen”.</p><p>This, it continued, was in clear “violation of domestic laws and international conventions, which prohibit the use of civilians to fight”.</p><p>Yemenis who died as a result of the unrest at the border were often buried in the kingdom without their families being informed.

MintPress caught up with Jameel and his family as they fled along the rugged al-Rahedah road after being forced to evacuate their home in the Kreter region of Aden on Sunday. “We found no shelter except for the mountains. So we will scatter into the empty places between the rocks.” Jameel’s car was one of the dozens laden with escapees – mostly children and women – on the highway linking the Taiz and Aden governorates.</p><p>Thousands of families in Aden, Abyan and Shabwa evacuated their homes to al-Turbah districts in Taiz, al-Mahrah, Sana`a and Marib provinces to escape the mutual ethnic-cleansing campaigns being waged by forces loyal to Saudi-backed former Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the United Arab Emirates-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC). The campaigns come amid an already acute shortage of food, clean drinking water, and medicine.</p><p>Ahmed Salem, an internally displaced Yemeni citizen (IDP), told MintPress that his home was raided and he was severely beaten in front of his four children before being given a chance to flee the city. His was one of 6,978 cases of grave human rights violations committed by pro -UAE forces against civilians in the southern Yemeni provinces of Aden, Abyan and Shabwah during the month of August, according to the Yemeni American Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights, an independent human-rights group.</p><p>That figure <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.rightsradar.org/en/latest_details.php?id%3D82&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1567539251961000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGYqBiGyTqqm5yXb86-g6YOKjBWPA">was confirmed</a></span> by the Amsterdam-based human-rights group Rights Radar.</p><p>However, a number of IDPs were not as lucky as Ahmed Salem and were killed while fleeing, while other families were trapped in their homes by fighting, unable to secure food and without medical aid and clean water. “It’s total chaos here. There was fighting in the city all day yesterday. Things appear to have calmed down a bit this morning, but we expect the hostilities to resume at any point,” Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Programme Manager Caroline Seguin said in a statement. Fighting has since resumed since Seguin’s statement was made. In fact, in just one day, 51 people were killed, 10 of them already dead by the time they reached the hospital, according to MSF. </p><p>Saudi, UAE proxies take turns killing Yemeni civilians</p><p>According to witness testimony given to MintPress, after Saudi-backed militants pulled out of Aden, forces from the STC began to raid homes, hotels, businesses and popular neighborhoods, and arrested scores of pro-Hadi activists, politicians and clerics belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood Movement, accusing them of terrorism. Dozens were killed, dragged onto the streets in scenes reminiscent of those during ISIS takeovers of cities in Syria and Iraq.</p><p>Attacks on civilians have also extended to detainees, hospital patients, travelers and hotel guests. Pro-Saudi detainees and wounded persons in hospitals were executed when “a group belonging to the Security Belt forces stormed homes belonging to the Hadi government in Dar Saad, Kreter districts, and Zenjebar and killed many pro-Saudi [people],” according to witnesses who spoke to MintPress. </p><p>Yemenis who once fought alongside Saudi Arabia and the UAE are now saying what the Houthis have repeated since the war on Yemen began four years ago — that Saudi Arabia and the UAE did not go to Yemen to liberate it, but to occupy its islands and ports and to steal its fortunes - by Ahmed AbdulKareem</p><p><span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/saudi-uae-proxies-trade-blows-aden-yemen-civilians-pay-price/261661/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/saudi-uae-proxies-trade-blows-aden-yemen-civilians-pay-price/261661/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>How the US Shattered the Middle East</strong></p><p>Yemen is a nightmare, a catastrophe, a mess—and the United States is highly <a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/complicit-americas-non-war-crimes-yemen/">complicit in the whole disaster</a>.</p><p>What makes the situation in the Arabian Peninsula’s south particularly disturbing is that supposed foreign policy “experts” in D.C. have long been hysterically asserting that the top risk to America’s safety are Islamist-occupied <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/01/26/al-qaeda-islamic-state-myth-of-the-terrorist-safe-haven/">“safe havens”</a> or ungoverned spaces. I’m far from convinced that the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-16/terrorist-safe-havens-war-afghanistan">safe-haven myth</a> carries much water; after all, the 9/11 attacks were planned in Germany and the US as much as in, supposedly, the caves of Afghanistan. Still, for argument’s sake, let’s take the interventionist experts’ assumption at face value. In that case, isn’t it ironic that in Yemen—and (as I’ll demonstrate) countless other countries—US military action has repeatedly created the very state fracture and ungoverned spaces the policymakers and pundits so fear?</p><p>Let us take an ever-so-brief tour of Washington’s two-decade history of utterly rupturing Greater Mideast nation-states and splintering an already fractious region. Here goes, from West to East, in an admittedly noncomprehensive list.</p><p>The point is that the US has irreparably fractured a broad swath of the globe from West Africa to Central Asia. Interventionist pundits in both parties and countless think tanks insist that the US military must remain in place across the region to police dangerous “ungoverned spaces,” yet recent history demonstrates irrefutably that it is the very intervention of Washington and presence of its troops that fragments once (relatively) stable nation-states and empowers separatists and Islamists.</p><p>The whole absurd mess boils down to a treacherous math problem of sorts. By my simple accounting, a region from Nigeria to Afghanistan that once counted about 22 state entities has—since the onset of the US “terror wars”—broken into some 37 autonomous, sometimes hardly governed, zones. According to the “experts,” that should mean total disaster and increased danger to the homeland. Yet it’s largely US military policy and intervention itself that’s <em>caused</em> this fracture. So isn’t it high time to quit the American combat missions?

Rather, they point to the useful cover the Houthis’ banner offers for activities probably carried out directly by Iranian personnel or cadres from more capable Iranian proxies such as Lebanese Hezbollah.</p><p>FROM ISRAEL’S point of view, the growing strength of the Houthis, and the evidence of direct IRGC/Hezbollah involvement with them, raise the possibility that the broad front on which Jerusalem’s forces are already engaged (across Lebanon, Syria and Iraq) may imminently extend also to Yemen.<br /> The latter is no longer an isolated front in which Israel’s de facto Gulf partners are engaging against a weaker and peripheral Iranian ally. Rather, the Houthi-controlled part of Yemen appears set to emerge as an additional platform for the projection of Iranian power.<br /> Currently, that power projection is directed on land against Saudi Arabia. But of greater regional significance is the possibility that Iranian weaponry smuggled into the Houthi-controlled part of Yemen could subsequently be used to attack shipping making its way up the Red Sea toward the Suez Canal. The Houthi-controlled region, after all, includes a considerable section of Yemen’s Red Sea coast.<br /> Such a capability would form an additional useful tool of pressure for Iran in the region-wide contest currently taking place. And as things currently stand, Israel may well be the only power both able and willing to frustrate the Iranian effort to establish this capability.<br /> The rise and consolidation of the Houthis may seem to be taking place at a considerable distance from Jerusalem. But as things currently stand, Yemen is both Israel’s and Iran’s backyard. As a result, it constitutes an additional key arena in the contest currently playing out between them.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Behind-the-Lines-Yemen-Irans-and-Israels-new-backyard-600797">https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Behind-the-Lines-Yemen-Irans-and-Israels-new-backyard-600797</a></span><span> = <a href="https://www.meforum.org/59323/saudi-arabia-is-losing-yemen-to-iran">https://www.meforum.org/59323/saudi-arabia-is-losing-yemen-to-iran</a></span></p><p>My comment: This article obviously should be labeled as propaganda.

I’m not holding my breath, and the audience should not, regarding what the United Nations may do or may not do. We know that the UN is subject to one, the imposition of the will of the United States, and two, financial power and clout of Saudi Arabia, which can erase its listing on countries which violate children’s rights and so on. We’ve seen a history of that, so I think justice should be served somewhere else. Second point about what Bernie Sanders said, and I think we should add beyond what he said, that this is true of all the wars in the Middle East. The US is an accomplice in Israeli war crimes and Saudi war crimes and all the crimes that occur in the region because the US is the sponsor of almost all the despots of the region.</p><p>On the regional conflict going there, we should remember that there is no harmony between Saudi Arabia and UAE. They are together if there is a project they can work on together. They are united along with the Israeli state in order to oppose Iran because they have their own agenda and they want to fight Palestinian and Arab resistance movements throughout the Middle East. On that, they agree, but on many others they disagree. They disagree about the regional conflict, about OPEC policies, about how to handle Iran and many of these issues, there is no complete agreement. Of course, the UAE has not been happy about Saudi domination in the Gulf Cooperation Council, which is a council established by the United States to counter Iran after the Iranian revolution.</p><p>Within Yemen itself, there is also a rivalry between the two sides, I mean before this war and after, and the complicity of US and Britain and Israel.</p><p>It seems to me that UAE for the last three years is the basically not less famous regional hegemon of the Middle East. We hear a lot about MBS, Mohammad bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, but we hear less of a less flamboyant ruler, despot, Mohammad bin Zayed of the UAE, who, while pursuing policies as destructive and as war-mongering as MBS, but he keeps a lower profile. On many files, he has been a champion of MBS in Saudi Arabia, but up to a point because he has his regional ambitions.</p><p>His regional ambitions has took him to fight with the Americans in Afghanistan, to send troops to Libya, to invest in a coup d’état in Egypt against a democratically-elected president, and now we’re seeing they are trying to divide the spoils of war before a peaceful settlement is imposed by the outside. I think the Americans have realized, despite their own largesse and the willingness to allow the Saudis and the UAE to commit as many war crimes as they wish, that it’s not going anywhere and they have not been able to bring the Houthis down. If anything, the Houthis have become more defined. It’s for those reasons there is a fight between the two sides.</p><p><span><a href="https://therealnews.com/stories/un-report-on-yemen-us-uk-accomplices-to-atrocities-while-inaction-continues">https://therealnews.com/stories/un-report-on-yemen-us-uk-accomplices-to-atrocities-while-inaction-continues</a></span></p><p>Interview in film: <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-YkmUoVHY4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-YkmUoVHY4</a></span></p><p><span>(B K P)</span></p><p><span>Nauseating how notoriously corrupt <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hashtag_click">#Yemen</a> politicians now feigning shock &amp; outrage over recent attack on troops when for 5 years were quiet while civilians, including women and children, massacred by SAME force.

These rapid and unexpected military reverses are rich in lessons for U.S. policymakers eager to assess Hadi’s strength, the current Saudi and Emirati roles in the conflict, and the risk of an al-Qaeda recovery in Yemen.</p><p>RAPID SHIFTS IN THE MILITARY BALANCE</p><p>Since large-scale fighting broke out between the STC and Hadi’s forces on August 7, Yemen’s remarkably fluid military situation has raced through several stages:</p><p>Yemeni forces are heavily reliant on foreign backers. The STC and its militia allies outnumbered Hadi’s forces in Shabwa by roughly ten brigades to seven, yet they quickly cracked when the UAE withdrew local support on August 21, cutting off their ammunition and fuel supplies. Coupled with Emirati political pressure, this lack of logistical support soon spurred three secessionist brigades to flip to Hadi without a fight. Conversely, Saudi support made Hadi’s forces more resilient, and Riyadh’s takeover of the UAE patronage system in Shabwa (i.e., paying salaries) helped flip most of the remaining secessionist brigades within four days.</p><p>Hadi military forces are resilient. Although ragged, the government’s local military units have demonstrated impressive defensive resilience and offensive drive throughout the past month, largely due to four factors: </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WAR</p><p>The current crisis in south Yemen is not yet settled, and U.S. policymakers should stay alert for potential new shifts in the conflict, particularly the following:</p><p>Expansion opportunities for Hadi and the Houthis. </p><p>A more prominent Saudi role. </p><p>A strengthened Hadi camp. Although no one should expect him to liberate Sana anytime soon, President Hadi has retained Saudi backing, reinserted forces into Aden, captured the entirety of the Marib-Shabwa energy corridor, and positioned his forces to expand into southern Hadramawt. He has also demonstrated a keen desire to stay in office, constantly refining and strengthening his cabinet of northern and southern power players, businessmen, and technocrats. Yet while entrenching his associates at every level would be understandable for an elected leader, it is less so for a UN-installed transitional placeholder. Therefore, in addition to steering him away from a Hadramawt offensive, the UN, Washington and Riyadh should expedite discussion on transitioning beyond the interim president down the road.</p><p>Breathing space for AQAP. – by Alexandre Mello and Michael Knights</p><p><span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/yemens-fragile-military-balance">https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/yemens-fragile-military-balance</a></span></p><p>My comment: The authors propagate more US interference, siding with and supporting the US proxy Hadi government.

This development, which follows the UAE's announcement that it intends to reduce its forces in Yemen, is yet another sign that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are divided over the nature and possible reformation of the Yemeni state. While Saudi Arabia is determined to return Yemen to its pre-war unified governmental structure and reinstate the government that was expelled from Sanaa in March 2015, the UAE’s strategic and economic interests are served by securing the southern region’s aspirations for an independent state. The UAE’s military withdrawal will make it more difficult for the Saudis to fight against the Houthis, as the bulk of the ground fighting was conducted by the UAE, mercenaries from Somalia and Colombia, and local forces. The United States and Israel should be concerned about the outcome of the conflict in Yemen, particularly if the UAE's withdrawal emboldens the Houthis. The result could be a situation in which the Houthis, with their expanding cooperation with Iran, control north Yemen and continue to hit strategic targets in Saudi Arabia and threaten traffic in the Red Sea. Continued attacks on Saudi Arabia, the interruption of global commerce, and growing friction in the Riyadh-Abu Dhabi axis will disrupt efforts of Israel and the United States, as they seek to build a more powerful and unified front to counter the malign activities of Iran and its proxies.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.inss.org.il/publication/the-war-in-yemen-and-future-relations-between-riyadh-and-abu-dhabi/">https://www.inss.org.il/publication/the-war-in-yemen-and-future-relations-between-riyadh-and-abu-dhabi/</a></span></p><p><span>(* A K P)</span></p><p><span>Abductees Mothers</span></p><p>We hold the Arab Coalition, international community, the UN, and Houthi armed group responsible for the manslaughter of many of our sons.</p><p>We, additionally, hold Houthi armed group accountable for abducting and forcibly hiding dozens of our sons, and imprisoning them at Community College buildings which had been turned by Houthis from and academic campus into a prison.</p><p>Inside that prison, many abductees had been killed by torture and systematic healthcare negligence, and prevented from visits, food, and medications.

If such fighting between UAE-backed separatists and forces loyal to the UN-respected Yemeni government escalates further, it will be increasingly difficult for the Saudi leadership to accept the costs of either continuing to remain in Yemen or exiting the conflict.<br /> Put simply, there will be no easy options for Riyadh. And divergent strategies and conflicting interests in relation to southern Yemen will also impact Emirati-Saudi coordination vis-à-vis other crises in the region, from the Libyan and Syrian civil wars to the blockade of Qatar and policies aimed at countering Iranian influence.</p><p>Global ramifications</p><p>Against the backdrop of much discussion over the growing rift in the Saudi Arabia-UAE alliance, it would be misguided to ignore how the US and Russia's geopolitical competition factor into the equation. Much like in Syria and other regional wars, the escalating crisis in southern Yemen is one where Abu Dhabi appears to be moving closer to Moscow, while Riyadh remains far more aligned with Washington.</p><p>Although Russia's leadership has refrained from overtly siding with the STC against Hadi's administration, experts contend that Moscow views the southern secessionists' takeover of Aden and the real possibility of Yemen being split along North-South lines as a means to expand Russian influence in the greater Arab world. In Aden, the Russians may consider establishing a naval base at some point in the future.</p><p>Based on the history of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) being the Arabian Peninsula's only pro-Soviet regime - as well as STC delegations visiting Moscow, which undeniably factor into the growing Moscow-Abu Dhabi partnership - it is easy to imagine Russia profiting from a fragmented Yemeni state.</p><p>With Yemenis divided over questions about their country's (dis)unity and the role of al-Islah, the UAE will remain a divisive actor in the broader Yemeni conflict. <br /> Nonetheless, it's clear that Abu Dhabi is willing to break with its close allies - Riyadh and Washington - in pursuit of its own interests, even if that counters the international community's perceived interests in Yemen's post-1990 unity surviving the ongoing escalation of violence in Aden.</p><p>Not unlike the situation in Libya, the US faces a dire situation in Yemen, with divisions between its Arab Gulf allies bubbling to the surface. <br /> Much like elsewhere in the tumultuous Middle East, Washington's lack of cohesive strategies regarding the tension in southern Yemen could easily play further into the hands of Russia, especially as President Vladimir Putin and those in his inner circle are determined to restore the clout the Soviet Union lost when the Cold War ended – by Giorgio Cafiero</p><p><span><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2019/9/2/saudi-arabia-uae-have-lost-the-plot-in-yemen">https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2019/9/2/saudi-arabia-uae-have-lost-the-plot-in-yemen</a></span></p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p>Yemen: Rights Radar calls on the int, l community to intervene to curb grave abuses in Aden and Abyan</p><p>The Amsterdam-based Rights Radar foundation for Human Rights in the Arab World has called for putting an end to the wave of grave abuses committed by the militants of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council against the civilians in the governorates of Aden and Abyan since last week.</p><p><span><a href="https://rightsradar.org/en/latest_details.php?id=82">https://rightsradar.org/en/latest_details.php?id=82</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p><span>Films, Elisabeth Kendall: </span><span>A 2 minute attempt to untangle what's happening in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hashtag_click">#Yemen</a>: How new is the conflict in the south?

It is more than a minor spat between allies. In the long run, what sort of compromise can there be between the Saudi-backed president of a united Yemen fighting to maintain the integrity of his state, and the UAE-backed STC, dedicated to re-establishing an independent nation of South Yemen? Suddenly Yemen’s President Hadi is facing two enemies: the Houthis and the southern separatists.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/09/02/the-disintegration-of-yemen/">https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/09/02/the-disintegration-of-yemen/</a></span></p><p>(* B P)</p><p>The Latest On The Situation In Yemen</p><p>NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Yemen expert April Alley with the International Crisis Group, about how allies against the Houthis are escalating violence in Yemen by also supporting opposite sides.</p><p>ALLEY: Yeah, so what we've seen - I mean, this war is often described as a binary war, one between the Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition that's supporting the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. But really, this is a multipolar conflict. It's been that way from the beginning. But what we're seeing lately is that on the side of the coalition, the curtain has been pulled back to some extent. And so we're seeing the divisions on that side, different priorities on the Yemeni side for the future of Yemen, different visions for the country. And there's actually been fighting inside of the coalition over control of, particularly, their temporary capital of Aden and areas in the south of the country that the coalition controls.</p><p>Well, I think what we have right now is that Yemen's already complex civil war is now on the verge of a new layer, of a war within a war essentially. So we've already seen inside the coalition two groups come to - the fighting come to a head in Aden. And this is - right now, the Saudi - Saudi Arabia has called both sides to Jeddah for talks to see if they can be reconciled. But if this doesn't work, we could see significant violence in the south, in particular, and between nominal allies that the U.S. is supporting (with audio)</p><p><span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/04/757626227/the-latest-on-the-situation-in-yemen">https://www.npr.org/2019/09/04/757626227/the-latest-on-the-situation-in-yemen</a> = <a href="https://wamu.org/story/19/09/04/the-latest-on-the-situation-in-yemen/">https://wamu.org/story/19/09/04/the-latest-on-the-situation-in-yemen/</a></span> (Audio only)</p><p>(* B P)</p><p>Yemen: The Other Civil Wars</p><p>The Saudis accuse the UAE of being more interesting in supporting another partition of Yemen as a more effective solution to the perpetual Yemeni crises. According to the Saudis the UAE supports the Sunni separatist tribes in the south who want nothing to do with the Shia dominated northern Yemen. The Saudis believe that the UAE expects to be allowed to invest in new ports and other facilities in southern Yemen after the war. This is probably true, but investing in new or upgraded port facilities throughout the region is a major business activity for the UAE. Perhaps that provides the UAE with a different view of the mess in Yemen and a perpetual source of friction with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The possibility of a split has returned because the UAE has been in charge of security (and aid delivery) in the south since 2015 and supported the formation of the STC (South Transitional Council) as a means of maintaining peace and order down there. This group is composed of southern tribes that want autonomy but are willing to fight and defeat the Islamic terrorists as well as the Shia rebels first</p><p>One force in Aden that is loyal to the Yemen government and Saudi Arabia is the Islah (an Islamist Party in the south) militia. Islah has worked with the STC against the Shia rebels as well as the Islamic terrorists in the south. These are mainly AQAP (Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) and ISIL (Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant). Both these terrorist groups are still around but largely keeping their heads down in rural hideouts.</p><p>This lack of nationalism means a lack of cooperation or willingness to act in the public interest. Much of the Yemeni agricultural crises is caused by the fact that Yemen's economic situation has been rapidly deteriorating since the late 20<sup>th</sup> century. </p><p>Stubborn Saudis</p><p>The Saudis will carry on with efforts to defeat the Shia rebels despite UN pressure to make a peace deal the Shia rebels would currently accept. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.strategypage.com/qnd/yemen/articles/20190902.aspx">https://www.strategypage.com/qnd/yemen/articles/20190902.aspx</a></span></p><p>My comment: With parroting propaganda.</p><p>(* B P)</p><p>Saudi Arabia struggles to hold Yemen coalition together as allies face off</p><p>Saudi Arabia is struggling to hold together a military coalition fighting Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen after local allies turned on each other in a power struggle that has strained Riyadh’s alliance with its main regional partner, the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>The escalation risks further fracturing the Saudi-UAE alliance and emboldening the Houthi movement, which the coalition was formed to fight.</p><p>“Saudi Arabia finds itself in a quandary. Aggressive Saudi action to rein in the STC could trigger a civil war within a civil war in which Riyadh’s allies are far from sure to prevail,” the International Crisis Group said in a recent brief.</p><p>“Conversely, failure to act or offering what the government considers overly generous concessions to the STC ... could sow dissent within the Hadi government and Islahi ranks.”</p><p>Abu Dhabi now supports a reshuffling of Hadi’s government to include the STC and weaken the hold of Islah, which it sees as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood. Riyadh tolerates the party because it props up Hadi, who has no personal power base.</p><p>But the STC may not have broad support.

Nearly all schools in Yemen have no adequate sources of electricity, which prevents students from having access to safe water and sanitation services in a country that had the worst cholera outbreak in recorded history with over 1 million cases, more than half of which were children.</p><p>The absence of electricity also limits students’ access to other educational sources like laboratories.</p><p>The World Bank Group’s <span><a href="http://ida.worldbank.org/">International Development Association</a></span> through the <span><a href="http://projects.worldbank.org/P163777?lang=en">Yemen Emergency Electricity Access Project</a></span> is working with the United Nations Office for Project Services to install solar energy systems in schools and other key public facilities to provide reliable and affordable access to clean water, adequate lighting, and other amenities for communities affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis in areas where fuel and electricity supply are either nonexistent or too expensive to obtain.</p><p>The first 21 schools in Al Dhale, Lahej, Abyan, Dhamar, Mahweet, Taiz and Sanaa governorates are being connected to solar power at the moment. Overall, 159 schools across 17 governorates of Yemen have already selected to receive a solar installation so far, and several hundreds more will be supported in the course of the project, eventually covering all governorates of Yemen.</p><p>As there is no public electricity source for these communities at the moment, the power generated from solar panels is bringing water consistently into schools’ tanks.</p><p>The project not only provides sufficient lighting for children at school, but it has encouraged more students, especially girls, to attend school as they have improved the physical environment from stuffy, hot class rooms to enable them to interact with each other.</p><p>This solar power project aims at increasing resilience in rural areas where 70% of Yemen’s population lives, and seeks to address the current development crisis by restoring electricity supplies to vital facilities like hospitals, schools, and water companies, while also addressing the economic, social and environmental impact of energy.</p><p>At least 1,340,000 people are expected to benefit from this solar energy project, along with 400 health facilities and 800 schools. Moreover, the project will reduce carbon emissions by 430,000 tons of CO2 and contribute to meeting Yemen’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/09/05/solar-power-can-safeguard-the-future-for-thousands-of-yemeni-children">https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/09/05/solar-power-can-safeguard-the-future-for-thousands-of-yemeni-children</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/wfp">World Food Programme</a></span>: Yemen Emergency Dashboard, August 2019</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-emergency-dashboard-august-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-emergency-dashboard-august-2019</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/iom">International Organization for Migration</a></span><span>: </span>IOM Yemen: Transition and Recovery - 2nd Quarter Highlights (April - June 2019)</p><p>2,153 PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN CASH-FOR-WORK PROGRAMMING</p><p>39 COMMUNITY ASSETS REHABILITATED</p><p>221,800 PEOPLE REACHED THROUGH IMPROVED ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE (INDIRECT)</p><p>793,500 PEOPLE BENEFITTED FROM CLEANING CAMPAIGNS (INDIRECT)</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-transition-and-recovery-2nd-quarter-highlights-april-june-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-transition-and-recovery-2nd-quarter-highlights-april-june-2019</a></span></p><p>(B H)</p><p>IOM Yemen: Protection - 2nd Quarter Highlights (April - June 2019)</p><p>30,402 CHILDREN PARTICIPATED IN ACTIVITIES IN CHILD FRIENDLY SPACES</p><p>6,978 PEOPLE RECEIVED MENTAL HEALTH &amp; PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT</p><p>28,786 PEOPLE REACHED THROUGH PROTECTION AWARENESS RAISING ACTIVIES</p><p>3,096 MIGRANTS SUPPORTED THROUGH VOLUNTARY HUMANITARIAN RETURN</p><p>461 REFUGEES SUPPORTED THROUGH ASSISTED SPONTANIOUS RETURN</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-protection-2nd-quarter-highlights-april-june-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-protection-2nd-quarter-highlights-april-june-2019</a></span></p><p>(B H)</p><p>IOM Yemen: Shelter &amp; NFI - 2nd Quarter Highlights (April - June 2019)</p><p>68,417 PEOPLE REACHED THROUGH IN-KIND &amp; CASH ASSISTANCE</p><p>10,852 SHELTER, NONFOOD ITEMS &amp; HYGIENE KITS DISTRIBUTED</p><p>11,326 PEOPLE RECEIVED RENTAL SUPPORT</p><p>2,000+ METRIC TONNES OF S-NFI DELIVERED</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-shelter-nfi-2nd-quarter-highlights-april-june-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-shelter-nfi-2nd-quarter-highlights-april-june-2019</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/iom">International Organization for Migration</a></span>: IOM Yemen: Global Fund - Middle East Response Project - 1st and 2nd Quarter Highlights (January - June 2019)</p><p>KEY ACHIEVEMENTS</p><p>2,476 PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV ENROLLED IN ANTI-RETROVIRAL PROGRAMME</p><p>5,527 PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY TESTED FOR HIV</p><p>5,215 PEOPLE DIAGNOSED &amp; ENROLLED IN TREATMENT FOR ALL FORMS OF TB</p><p>433,478 LONG LASTING INSECTICIDE TREATED NETS DISTRIBUTED</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-global-fund-middle-east-response-project-1st-and-2nd-quarter-highlights">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-global-fund-middle-east-response-project-1st-and-2nd-quarter-highlights</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Die Bevölkerung bleibt in der Schusslinie - die erschütternde Geschichte der Familie Kaeed</p><p>Es ist unmöglich, einer Mutter Mut zuzusprechen, die ein Kind und neun weitere Mitglieder ihrer Familie verloren hat, weil Kriegsparteien im Jemen keine Rücksicht auf Zivilistinnen und Zivilisten nehmen.

They may also experience negative interactions with host communities and limited access to basic lifesaving services, which in turn can lead to further difficulties.</p><p>“My wife and children were under continuous harassment whenever they tried to gather wood near the village to be used as fuel for cooking,” says Salem.</p><p>Without access to fuel in the displacement site and deterred from travelling to the village, the family resorted to using plastic bottles from the road for their cooking fuel – a practice that is not only harmful for the environment but also dangerous to a person’s health.</p><p>As part of an IOM project that supports displaced people, the family was provided a full kitchen set, which contained a stove and gas cylinder. IOM’s intervention, funded by the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), has meant that the family can now cook their meals safely.</p><p>With their own cooking set and fuel, the family no longer needs to gather wood near the village or burn toxic plastic to cook their meals. The risks of being harassed by strangers outside the displacement site is greatly reduced.</p><p>The IOM team also provided the family with a full solar power system</p><p><span><a href="https://weblog.iom.int/finding-fuel-iom-helps-displaced-family-cook-safely">https://weblog.iom.int/finding-fuel-iom-helps-displaced-family-cook-safely</a></span></p><p><span>(*B H)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/unhcr">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a></span>: Somalia Situation: Population of Concern to UNHCR as of 31 July 2019</p><p>As of July 2019, Somalia was host to 35,040 registered refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from Ethiopia and Yemen.</p><p>Over 90,000 Somali refugees have voluntarily returnedto Somalia since December 2014 with UNHCR assistance from different countries of asylum including Kenya,Yemen, Djibouti, Libya, Tunisia and Eritrea.

They included espionage, apostasy, and trying to make certain areas in Yemen a homeland for Baha’is.</p><p>Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa research and advocacy director, said Bin Haydara’s trial is “part of a wider crackdown on critics, journalists, human rights defenders and members of the Baha’i community that is causing entire families to live in fear for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1549856/middle-east">https://www.arabnews.com/node/1549856/middle-east</a></span></p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p><span>We Have More Ability Than Ever To Teach Enemy Tough Lessons: Defense Minister</span></p><p><span><a href="https://sabanews.net/en/news3064868.htm">https://sabanews.net/en/news3064868.htm</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Houthis shut down eight private hospitals in Sana’a</p><p>The Houthi militants have shut down eight private hospitals in the capital Sana’a when managers failed to pay illegal money for the rebels’ military effort.</p><p>Medical sources said that the Houthi militants revoked licenses and removed posts from the closed hospitals’ buildings.</p><p>Inspection health officials accompanied by militants raided the hospitals and closed them.
