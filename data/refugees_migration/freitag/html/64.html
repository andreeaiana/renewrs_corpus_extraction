Now, it has been wiped out, after Saudi Arabia declared it a military zone — even the city’s hand-carved wooden doors have been reduced to ashes.</p><p>Yet Saudi airstrikes extend far beyond Sana’a’s historic sites — to Sadaa, Shibam Hadramout, Zabid in Hodeida, Shibam Kuban, east of Sana’a, Shabwa, Aden, Amran, Taiz, and other areas of the country’s history that have also fallen victim to coalition bombing. Airstrikes and shelling have destroyed at least 66 historic sites according to Muhannad al-Sayani, chairman of the Yemeni General Authority for Antiquities </p><p>Al-Sayani told MintPress that targeting of the country’s historic sites by the Saudi-led Coalition is deliberate: “These are open sites, mostly in desert areas where weapons cannot be stored.” Following many of the attacks, the Coalition often accuses the Houthis of using archaeological sites as weapons depots; however, no evidence has been provided to substantiate these allegations.</p><p>The undersecretary of the General Authority for the Preservation of Historic Cities, Amat al-Razzaq Jahaf, told MintPress that most of the monuments or sites have been damaged or destroyed by Saudi airstrikes since the Saudi-led campaign began without any justification.</p><p>Yemen’s General Authority of Antiquities complained to MintPress that the country’s heritage has been neglected by international organizations and communities.</p><p>Now, the buildings — which have stood tall for thousands of years in the historic city that surrounds the remnants of al-Aeini family home — are subject to eroding foundations and ominous cracks that line their ancient walls built of mud and stone, as a result of repeated Saudi attacks and the inability of Yemen’s government to address the deterioration amid four years of Saudi bombardment.</p><p>“If peace is brought to Yemen — and with it, compensation is provided — infrastructure, roads, schools, and hospitals could all be rebuilt; but nothing can bring back the historic architecture that has been destroyed,” Mohaned al-Sayani, chairman of the Yemeni General Authority for Antiquities, told MintPress.</p><p>The attack on ancient Sana’a was the first of many violent assaults on Yemen’s architectural history, but the worst hit historic area has been Yemen’s northern province of Saada, the hub of the ancient Minaean Kingdom of Ma’in, founded before the fourth century B.C. </p><p>Saada’s old city, which is among the world’s oldest human-carved landscapes, once consisted entirely of historic, centuries-old multi-story homes. Now, it has been wiped out, after Saudi Arabia declared it a military zone — even the city’s hand-carved wooden doors have been reduced to ashes.</p><p>To understand Saudi Arabia’s motivation to essentially exterminate Yemen’s heritage, one must understand Yemen’s history as well as that of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi-based Wahhabi faith, which provides religious justification for targeting heritage sites under the guise of eradicating polytheism.</p><p>In contrast to Yemen’s rich and ancient history, civilization did not make its way to the Arabian Gulf until the 1930s.</p><p>Many Yemenis, including Saleh Ali al-Aeini, believe that Saudi Arabia harbors severe jealousy over Yemen’s history and heritage and the unique role that it has played in human history. </p><p>Moreover, Wahhabism — the official state religion of Saudi Arabia, based on a puritanical and widely rejected interpretation of Islam — sees the preservation of historic and religious sites as tantamount to idolatry. The Wahhabi establishment in Saudi Arabia has not even spared the Kingdom’s own tombs and monuments in Mecca and Medina and shows special disdain for Yemen’s historic sites, especially those located in northern Yemen, the seat of the Shia Zaydis for over a thousand years.</p><p>Looting what was not destroyed</p><p>Destruction from the air is not the only threat to Yemen’s ancient legacy. During their war in Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have established smuggling networks in the country to loot historic sites.</p><p>A.M.M., who asked to be identified only by his initials, worked as an antiquities smuggler for a security outfit based in the UAE. A.M.M. told MintPress that his team sold four 2,500-year-old mummies, a gilded Torah scroll, and dozens of bejeweled daggers from the early Islamic era. “They always stressed the importance of keeping [the items] from being damaged so that they will be accepted by their American friends,” he said.</p><p>The smuggling of Yemeni antiquities is often carried out by diplomats operating out of Yemeni embassies from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt in return for lucrative sums of money allegedly provided by patrons from the United States and Israel. </p><p>For the Israelis, many of Yemen’s antiquities are seen as the rightful property of the Jewish people and there is reason to believe that <span><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/operation-to-rescue-yemeni-jews-was-2-years-in-the-making-son-says/">Israel is also involved</a></span> in the looting of Yemen’s heritage.</p><p>Officials in Sana’a say they have strong evidence that Yemeni artifacts are being sold off to American and Isreali buyers. “Artifacts featuring the Star of David or Jewish names are our priority; they often fetch a higher price than the other artifacts,” A.M.M told MintPress. “I sold one Hebrew manuscript to a UAE officer for $20,000,” he added – by Ahmed Abdulkareem</p><p><span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/us-israel-collectors-buy-yemen-ancient-historic-sites/261519/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/us-israel-collectors-buy-yemen-ancient-historic-sites/261519/</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/us-and-israeli-collectors-buy-up-what-remains-of-yemens-ancient-heritage/">https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/us-and-israeli-collectors-buy-up-what-remains-of-yemens-ancient-heritage/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong>She could only carry one child': people trapped by Yemen's war – in pictures</strong></p><p>Will Swanson has been photographing displaced people in southern Yemen and at the conflict frontline in Ad Dhale for two years, and describes some of the terrible conditions they endure</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2019/aug/28/people-trapped-yemen-war-in-pictures">https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2019/aug/28/people-trapped-yemen-war-in-pictures</a></p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong>Walking through a war zone: Ethiopians heading for Saudi – in pictures</strong></p><p>Escaping poverty and drought, Ethiopians are making the dangerous sea crossing from Djibouti to Yemen and then on foot to the Saudi border.

Lawrence and primitive drone technology, these 'ragtag' insurgents are besting major powers in Yemen.</p><p>If you want to see the future of war, look closely at the fighting in Yemen. </p><p>There, the Houthis, a rebel group based in the country’s northwest, have fought the lavishly funded and equipped militaries of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to a standstill. They have even proven capable of launching attacks deep <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2019/08/drone-attack-yemen-rebels-sparks-fire-saudi-oil-field-190817132916661.html">inside Saudi Arabia</a></span>. How did this poor, lightly equipped and armed rebel group do it? And what does it mean for the United States, which continues to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in complex, costly, and vulnerable weapons systems? </p><p>First, the Houthis have grasped the algebra of insurgency. In an article penned in 1920, T.E. Lawrence argued that insurgents would be victorious if they understood and applied a set of “algebraical factors.” He listed these as mobility, force security, and respect for the populace. The Houthis have refined and applied all three to varying degrees over the last decade. </p><p>The Houthi forces are small and highly mobile, and this, combined with Yemen’s mountainous terrain, provides them with force security. Most critically, they and their allies have respected the local populace by providing—at least relative to southern Yemen—high levels of security and predictability. </p><p>Second, the Houthis have enthusiastically <span><a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-06-03/cheap-drones-are-changing-calculus-war-yemen">embraced the use of drones</a></span>. They have no air force, no consistent means of defense against the Saudi and Emirati aircraft that have controlled Yemen’s airspace for four years. Yet with the use of cheap and relatively easily manufactured drones, they have conducted aerial surveillance and launched attacks on targets, including ones in Saudi Arabia. Drones, even more than the missiles the Houthis build and launch, have been a game changer, and have been seamlessly integrated into the Houthis’ already mobile and capable forces.</p><p>While there have been numerous claims and counter-claims by various governments and intelligence services about Iranian aid to the Houthis, in the first two years of the Saudi- and Emirati-led intervention in Yemen, this assistance <span><a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/understanding-houthi-faction-yemen">was limited</a></span>. The relationship between Tehran and the Houthis’ leadership was often rocky. </p><p>However, Iran has—over the last two years—supplied technical advice and some key components for drones and missiles to the Houthis.</p><p>Iran made the same calculations with the Houthis that the U.S. made with the mujahideen. It saw two of their regional foes make the mistake of intervening in a complex, messy civil war in a country with terrain similar to that of Afghanistan.</p><p>The war in Yemen points to a future where the overly complex weapons systems that the U.S. buys at the behest of its military-industrial complex may be rendered less and less effective.</p><p>U.S. policymakers would do well to look closely at how the Houthis, with minimal—but strategic—aid from Iran, have stymied both the UAE and Saudi Arabia – by Michael Horton</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/are-yemens-houthis-the-future-of-war/">https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/are-yemens-houthis-the-future-of-war/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>The Houthi-Hezbollah Surrogate Nexus</strong></p><p>The Saudi government maintains that Iran is arming Ansarullah with the aim of transforming the Zaydi Houthi insurgency into a replica of Hezbollah in order to weaken Saudi Arabia, other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states, and their Western allies. Officials in Riyadh have also alleged that Tehran is sending Hezbollah military trainers to Yemen, and certain sources have reported that members of the Lebanese Shia group have fought alongside Ansarullah militants in battles along the Yemeni-Saudi border.</p><p>In fact, the Houthi movement emerged throughout the 1990s as an indigenous Yemeni organization supporting disenfranchised communities of Zaydi Shia in their drive to create a Zaydi imamate. Despite the sectarian dimension of Ansarullah’s narrative, the movement does not have any natural links with Iran’s ‘Islamic Revolution’ and only <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/05/16/contrary-to-popular-belief-houthis-arent-iranian-proxies/">received</a></span> assistance from Tehran and Lebanese Hezbollah after 2014. It was only then that Tehran realized the powerful potential of the Houthi militia as a means to attack the Saudi kingdom at its “soft underbelly,” at low cost and with plausible deniability.</p><p>Ever since Riyadh began direct military intervention in Yemen in March 2015, the strategic narrative of the Saudi-led coalition, tailored towards a Western audience, was that the kingdom was fighting to prevent a Hezbollah-like Houthi ‘terror state’ along Saudi Arabia’s southern border. This talking point has been propagated extensively in Washington in a Saudi effort to gain greater sympathy from both the Obama and Trump administrations, plus lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, for their anti-Houthi campaign. Such efforts have paid off well with this administration.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, which is leading a crumbling Arab military coalition in Yemen against Ansarullah, has vowed not to allow the Iran-allied militia to emerge as the country’s replica of Hezbollah. In fact, when Saudi Arabia’s previous ambassador to Washington, Khalid bin Salman, accused the Islamic Republic of sending Hezbollah military trainers to Yemen to help strengthen the Houthis, he put out a series of tweets alleging that the Arab coalition “uncovered a cache of evidence against Al Houthis, revealed a Hezbollah operative training, advising them on asymmetric warfare, and showed background portrait of Iran ‘Supreme Leader’ on Militia’s computer.” </p><p>It is legitimate to question the veracity of such claims. Sources maintaining that Hezbollah is extremely influential in Yemen are often of questionable credibility or pushing a political agenda that has much to gain from convincing Western statesmen that Saudi Arabia’s fight against Houthi insurgents mirrors Israel’s struggle against Hezbollah. Yet it would disingenuous to fully dismiss Hezbollah’s role in Yemen as merely propaganda from the White House, Riyadh, or Abu Dhabi.</p><p>In Yemen—like in Iraq, Syria, and allegedly Bahrain—Hezbollah has served as Iran’s most senior surrogate, serving as the backbone of the Islamic Republic’s regional “axis of resistance.” Both in terms of hard and soft power, Hezbollah has grown from a mere franchise of Iran’s IRGC in the early 1980s into a self-sustaining strategic proxy that enjoys considerable autonomy from its patron’s command and control. </p><p>Notwithstanding ideological links between Ansarullah and Hezbollah, the main crux of their relationship appears to be operational and rooted in pragmatism. To bog down the Arab coalition in Yemen, the Houthis have sought out training assistance, technological support, and operational direction from Hezbollah to achieve their objectives on the ground. For Hezbollah, the Yemeni civil war has represented an opportunity to humiliate the Saudis at a time in which the Lebanese organization is also struggling against Riyadh’s proxies within Lebanon.</p><p>At the risk of exaggerating Hezbollah’s role in the Yemeni civil war, it goes without saying that the Lebanese force, which Tehran has bankrolled for decades, has contributed to Houthi battlefield successes against the Saudi-led coalition - by Giorgio Cafiero and Andreas Krieg</p><p><span><a href="https://lobelog.com/the-houthi-hezbollah-surrogate-nexus/">https://lobelog.com/the-houthi-hezbollah-surrogate-nexus/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Houthi use of drones delivers potent message in Yemen War</strong></p><p>The Houthi movement, Ansar Allah, has made use of UAVs as a low-cost way to punish the Saudi-led coalition and inflict reputational and political damage. While the tactical advantage of using UAVs is limited, their symbolic value against the coalition and their territories is significant</p><p>The group’s deployment of UAVs serves two key functions – punishment and propaganda. But while the tactical advantage of using UAVs is limited, their symbolic value against the coalition and their territories is significant. Ansar Allah has succeeded in constructing an image of resilience against a vastly superior military adversary. As well as targeting the territory of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, Ansar Allah has found a low-cost way to punish its rivals by inflicting reputational and political damage.</p><p>Origins of Ansar Allah’s UAV arsenal</p><p>Successful UAV construction is highly dependent on a variety of externally sourced and individually procured materials, including satellite compasses originating from Indian-based entities and electrical components of Chinese origin. While its arsenal includes repurposed commercial UAVs, for Ansar Allah to produce truly indigenous systems, it will be heavily reliant on a global market as it seeks to source components.</p><p>Propaganda and tactical effectiveness</p><p>Ansar Allah’s UAV use has allowed it to make greater strategic gains in Yemen than in the coalition’s territory. </p><p>Nonetheless, UAVs have been successfully deployed to target and disable coalition <span><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/mideast-africa/2017/03/28/report-houthi-rebels-flying-iranian-made-kamikaze-drones-into-surveillance-radars/">air defences</a></span>, inflicting notable reputational damage. </p><p>Low-flying UAVs have also gone undetected by coalition air defences.</p><p>By targeting civilian sites within the coalition territories with missiles, rockets and UAVs, Ansar Allah imposes two political costs on the coalition. First, it credibly threatens the security of these sites and the civilians using them, while also signalling its resolve for escalating the conflict further. Second, Ansar Allah highlights that the coalition’s targeting of the group’s military capabilities is futile and will only heighten the first cost.</p><p>The coalition has also failed to build leverage with Ansar Allah, after the group <span><a href="http://twitter.com/abdusalamsalah/status/1137732703833468928">framed</a></span> its airport targeting strategy as a consequence of the coalition’s military campaign.

Consilium, a family-owned global consultancy on maritime and resource security, has been monitoring the potentially disastrous situation involving the Safer, a tanker converted into a floating storage and offloading facility (FSO) off the coast of Yemen, and we have been working to motivate action on the matter before it reaches a calamitous conclusion. </p><p>Our most recent analysis detailed possible environmental, humanitarian, and economic effects of a major spill from the rapidly deteriorating and potentially explosive vessel, which has become a bargaining chip in the Yemen conflict. The contamination of coastal desalination plants by spilled oil, depriving millions of people of clean drinking water, is just one of the consequences that could unfold unless decisive action is taken.</p><p>This past week, the UN announced that a major impasse appears to have been overcome, in that the Houthis, who have effective control of the Safer, have agreed to allow a United Nations (UN) team to board the vessel, conduct an inspection, and presumably offer recommendations on how best to restore the Safer to functional safety or otherwise secure the million-plus barrels of oil in its tanks.</p><p><span>I</span> t is difficult to ascertain the risk of explosion. Wholly apart from the possible hazard of volatile gases accumulating in the Safer’s storage tanks from lack of maintenance to the ship’s inert gas system, there is the real chance of detonation by other means. Mines have been laid in a number of places off the Yemen coast. </p><p>Rumors have proliferated, further complicating the picture. </p><p>More obviously, the structural decay of the vessel poses its own risks. Anyone familiar with maritime industries knows the corrosive power of seawater and salt air; in the exceptionally saline environment of the Red Sea, corrosion advances even more quickly and destructively than elsewhere. This past spring, a key piece of the Safer’s offloading machinery rusted through and fell into the waters below, fortunately missing the submarine pipeline feeding the FSO (though it has been shut off near its source, the pipeline is still believed to contain significant amounts, as much as a million barrels, of residual oil).</p><p>Below are photographs taken around the time of that incident, detailing the extent of the damage neglect and corrosion have inflicted on the Safer. Onboard oil pipes have already leaked. Seals and manifolds are rusting through. The offloading hose has already, temporarily, spilled oil into the surrounding waters. Even the ship’s single hull reveals an urgent need for maintenance. These images offer some sense of what the UN inspection team will find on board the vessel; hopefully the team will arrive armed with enough knowledge to do more than merely confirm what the photos already make clear.</p><p><span><a href="https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/yemen-fso-poses-oil-spill-risk">https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/yemen-fso-poses-oil-spill-risk</a></span></p><p><span>and also </span><span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7403949/Disaster-feared-ticking-time-bomb-Yemen-tanker-explodes.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7403949/Disaster-feared-ticking-time-bomb-Yemen-tanker-explodes.html</a></span></p><p><span>(B K P)</span></p><p><span>Film by Press TV Iran: </span>Yemen retaliatory raids can bring KSA to its knees: Analyst</p><p><span>Political commentator Hussein al-Bukhaiti says the continuation of retaliatory attacks by the Yemeni army is the only way that can compel Saudi Arabia to end its war on the country.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/08/26/604506/Yemen-retaliatory-attack-Saudi-Arabia-war">https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/08/26/604506/Yemen-retaliatory-attack-Saudi-Arabia-war</a></span></p><p>My remark: A pro-Houthi viewpoint.</p><p>(* B P)</p><p>Elisabeth Kendall: <span>Clip from my interview on Al Jazeera this afternoon following renewed fighting in </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Aden?src=hashtag_click">#Aden</a></span><span>, </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hashtag_click">#Yemen</a></span><span>: -Where does this leave the </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Saudi?src=hashtag_click">#Saudi</a></span><span>-</span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UAE?src=hashtag_click">#UAE</a></span><span> alliance? -What does it mean for Yemen's territorial integrity?</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_E_Kendall/status/1167105763183140864">https://twitter.com/Dr_E_Kendall/status/1167105763183140864</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p><span>Jemen: Ein Krieg, an dem Europa mitverdient</span></p><p><span>Am Jemen-Krieg lässt sich wie an keiner anderen Katastrophe zeigen, wie flexibel der Westen mit seinen eigenen Werten umgeht.

Er unterstützt die „Arabische Koalition“, trotz dokumentierter Fälle ihrer möglichen Kriegsverbrechen.</p><p>Es klingt zynisch, aber die Realität ist: Über die Folgen ferner Kriege klagen wir erst, wenn wir davon betroffen sind.

It forced her to bear the burden of life and take on new jobs that are not accepted in her society. As a result of the dire circumstances, many women and girls are forced to work as waitresses. </p><p>Farah Said, 33 years old, is one of the tragic stories, “I am a nursing graduate. I finished my specialty after hard years of study. I couldn’t find a job that fits my specialty, therefore I was forced to work as a waitress in a restaurant to provide my family with food, rent, and other basic necessities.”</p><p>Said has worked in a luxury restaurant for 12 hours daily for almost a year and supported her family of four. Meanwhile, society despises her because she works an inferior job. </p><p>“The only opportunity for me and many women like me is serving food to men and women to get 1340 R.Y. (3$),” said Said. </p><p>Although she spends long hours in the restaurant, her family doesn’t know that she works in a job which, according to them, is forbidden and breaks all the rituals and tradition in Yemeni society. </p><p><span><a href="http://belqeesrights.org/2019/08/26/working-as-yemeni-waitress-is-a-painful-journey-to-break-the-chains-of-society/">http://belqeesrights.org/2019/08/26/working-as-yemeni-waitress-is-a-painful-journey-to-break-the-chains-of-society/</a></span></p><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/AhmadAlgohbary">Ahmad Algohbary:</a> The only thing that make you happy is the moment when you travel hundreds of miles to help people from your country.

Eighty per cent of the population – 24.1 million people – need some form of humanitarian assistance. Two hundred-thirty out of Yemen’s 333 districts are at risk of famine, and in 45 districts, an estimated of 2.8 million people are facing catastrophic food insecurity.</p><p>An estimated 3.34 million people are internally displaced across the country; another 1 million have returned to their homes. </p><p>Severe shortage of funding to the YHRP is threatening the continuation of humanitarian programmes.

Bisher ist weniger als die Hälfte dieses Betrages eingegangen. Von den 34 großen humanitären UN-Programmen im Jemen, werden nur drei für das gesamte Jahr finanziert. Mehrere wurden in den letzten Wochen geschlossen, und viele Großprojekte zur Unterstützung bedürftiger, hungriger Familien konnten nicht gestartet werden. Weitere 22 lebensrettende Programme werden in den nächsten zwei Monaten abgeschlossen, sollten keine Mittel bereitgestellt werden.</p><p>„Wir alle schämen uns für die Situation“, sagte Frau Grande. „Es ist herzzerreißend, einer Familie in die Augen zu sehen und zu sagen, dass wir kein Geld haben, um zu helfen.“</p><p>Das UN-Büro für die Koordination humanitärer Angelegenheiten (OCHA) sagte, dass die Vereinten Nationen gezwungen waren, die meisten Impfkampagnen des Landes im Mai auszusetzen. Die Beschaffung von Medikamenten wurde eingestellt, und Tausende Menschen vom Gesundheitspersonal erhalten keine finanzielle Unterstützung mehr. Die Pläne für den Bau von 30 neuen Ernährungszentren wurden zurückgestellt sowie 14 sichere Häuser und vier spezialisierte Einrichtungen, die sich um die psychische Gesundheit von Frauen kümmern, wurden geschlossen.

Aware of this reality, Houthis have waged a ruthless battle against media outlets and radio stations across the country.</p><p>“It’s not only radio stations that are under attack, but the entire media in the country,” says Amir Basloom, a manager of a large radio station in eastern Yemen. “They storm your office, confiscate equipment and detain workers, and then tell you what you’re allowed to broadcast,” he told the Media Line.</p><p>As a result, most radio stations in Yemen have gone off air. Those that stayed in business began taking orders from Houthi strongmen.</p><p>“The risk is not just physical, it’s also financial,” Basloom explained. “The Houthi rebels force all businesses to donate a portion of their revenues to the so-called war effort.”</p><p>Radio stations and media outlets, which benefit from ad money, have been disproportionately affected by this tax, he says.</p><p>“If you refuse to pay you’re immediately considered a traitor or a heretic,” Basloom explained, adding that “one might be imprisoned, or even killed, for refusing to donate money [to the Houthis].”</p><p>Indeed, most stations seeking to continue broadcasting independent content have been forced to relocate to areas outside of Houthi control, including to other Arab capitals such as Riyadh, Cairo, and Abu Dhabi.</p><p><span><a href="https://themedialine.org/by-region/radio-becomes-new-battlefield-in-yemen-war/">https://themedialine.org/by-region/radio-becomes-new-battlefield-in-yemen-war/</a></span></p><p>My comment: This article is one-sided anti-Houthi – other parties in Yemen are not better at all.

It also supported a negotiated political settlement that engages all parties in an inclusive dialogue to resolve differences and address the legitimate concerns of all of Yemen’s people, including those in the country’s south.</p><p>The 15-member organ also condemned in the strongest terms the escalation of Houthi attacks on civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and calls on them to cease such actions immediately without preconditions as they pose a serious security threat to that country and the wider region, as well as to the United Nations-led political process on Yemen.</p><p>The Council also expressed its deep concern at the escalation in violence and the recent loss of life and injuries in Aden, Saa’da, Sana’a, Shabwa and across the country, calling once again on all parties to fulfil their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law.

One substantial hurdle is that both the Houthis and the government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi will most likely lose influence as a consequence of a peace agreement. At the same time, the involvement of regional actors in the conflict, such as Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), complicates negotiations. Nevertheless, the EU, including Denmark, should push for a comprehensive peace agreement and an end to the Saudi-led military campaign. However, this is only one element in bringing a sustainable peace to Yemen. A second point of focus should be support to long-term political and economic development, including local development due to the Yemen’s fragmented political reality.</p><p>Political fragmentation </p><p>The ongoing UN-led negotiations focuses on elite-level politics</p><p>Locally led development can help stabilize Yemen</p><p>Yemen has a long tradition of local development, and extended family networks continue to show remarkable innovation in stretching limited resources. However, whereas the political and economic fragmentation underscores the need for locally relevant approaches, local sources of authority should not be seen as a panacea for all Yemen’s problems. While some local authorities work to mitigate the consequences of the conflict, others are benefitting from its continuation through smuggling, skimming off aid, or taking advantage of the collapse of the central state to keep taxes or incomes from natural resources.</p><p>The political and economic fragmentation means that local actors are increasingly focused on their own areas, whereas the Yemeni central state, which has never had much of a presence outside the larger cities, is seen as obsolete at best and an obstacle at worst.The Yemenis must decide whether there is a future for a united Yemen, but regardless of the overall political structure, locally led decentralization can help stabilize Yemen – by Maria-Louise Clausen</p><p><span><a href="https://www.diis.dk/en/research/achieving-a-sustainable-peace-in-yemen-lies-with-locally-driven-initiatives">https://www.diis.dk/en/research/achieving-a-sustainable-peace-in-yemen-lies-with-locally-driven-initiatives</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>UN confirms support for Yemeni government's efforts to restore stability in southern Yemen</p><p>The United Nations has confirmed its support for Yemen’s legitimate government and efforts to restore stability in the country's southern regions.</p><p>This came in an oral message from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, carried by his special envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths and conveyed during his meeting with President Hadi at the latter's residence in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Guterres, according to the state-run Saba news agency, praised the president's sincere and serious positions towards peace and the coming up of Security, Stability and Harmony in the Republic.

On the one hand, there are the ultra-hawks Bolton and Vice President Mike Pence, the latter of whom notably said that: “The world missed an opportunity last time to confront the regime, but not this time.” Their less war-centric remarks on the subject still find backing from Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, OilPrice.com understands.</p><p>He and the lesser hawks still prefer the option currently being used of changing the regime in Iran by crippling its economy to such a degree that popular unrest removes the current power structures in the country, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). To this end, the past few weeks have seen the U.S. end all waivers on importing oil from Iran, designate the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organisation, and sanction 14 individuals and 17 entities linked to Iran’s shadowy Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (‘SPND’ initialism in Farsi).</p><p>Opposing Bolton and the other hawks in the U.S. are some of the most senior figures in the U.S. intelligence community. </p><p><span><a href="https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/The-CIAs-Dark-Prince-Doesnt-Want-War-With-Iran.html">https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/The-CIAs-Dark-Prince-Doesnt-Want-War-With-Iran.html</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>IRGC Commander: US Sanctions Futile, Iran to Continue Support for Yemenis</p><p>Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Aerospace Force Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh said that the US sanctions against Iran proved inefficient, stressing the country's continued support for the Yemeni people.</p><p>"Today, the US military power does not help it and the weapon of its sanctions is empty of bullets," General Hajizadeh said, addressing a ceremony in Tehran on Thursday.</p><p>He stressed Iran's military power, and said the US aircraft carrier which was due to enter the Persian Gulf did not dare to approach the waterway and deployed 700km away from the Iranian coasts.</p><p><span><a href="https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980607000615">https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980607000615</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Lavrov: Putin Backs Macron’s Initiative to Save Iran Nuclear Deal</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says Moscow is aware of French President Emmanuel Macron's initiative to save the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, noting that his boss, President Vladimir Putin, has already met the French head of state and given him his full support.</p><p>Reports emerged this week that Macron's plan, which he discussed in detail with US President Donald Trump and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in separate meetings, included a "softening" of economic sanctions against Tehran in exchange for some liabilities.</p><p>Speaking to reporters at a press conference on Wednesday, Lavrov confirmed that Macron had also filled Putin in on his plan during at an extraordinary Russian-French summit at Fort de Bragnacon a week ago.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/08/28/604731/Iran-JCPOA-Russia-France-Lavrov-Putin-Macron-initiative-Trump">https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/08/28/604731/Iran-JCPOA-Russia-France-Lavrov-Putin-Macron-initiative-Trump</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p><span>Audio: </span><span>Straße von Hormus: Die Bündnisfalle</span></p><p>Der Straße von Hormus droht eine Blockade.

From Beirut to Kabul, Iran has managed to become a player of increasing significance. This is why it is critical as ever for the United States and its regional allies to move beyond their enmity with Iran and move towards high-level diplomacy in order to stabilize the region enough for the U.S. to be able to end its forever wars. The 2015 nuclear deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA) and the immediate need to deescalate tensions in the Persian Gulf should just be the beginning, not the ultimate goal. At the end of the day, Iran’s role is critical if the U.S. wants to pivot away from the region and turn its attention to more pressing global matters better aligned with its actual interests.</p><p>Now, it’s important to be aware that Iran’s regional leverage does not mean everything is going smoothly. For example, the Iraqis are <span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/08/iraq-iran-us-pmu.html">questioning the influence</a></span> of the Iran-backed Shia militias, Assad remains at a relative stalemate as Iran’s allies in Syria—Turkey and Russia—pursue their own agendas, and sanctions are <span><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/02/iran-isnt-trying-to-build-a-bomb-tomorrow-it-wants-sanctions-relief-uranium-jcpoa-trump-enrichment/">taking a toll</a></span> on the Iranian economy.</p><p>However, the U.S. plan to isolate Iran only <span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/06/iran-sanctions-impact-women-civil-society-maximum-pressure.html">disempowers Iranian civil society</a></span> and democratic movements while leaving Iran’s leverage in the region a reality. It’s simply counterproductive. The U.S. could continue to work with its limited supply of regional allies to maneuver around Iran, but at the end of the day it will be an agreement (or a series of agreements) with Iran that will actually move the U.S. closer to closing the book on multiple fronts. If the President or a future administration is serious about avoiding another war and giving room for the U.S. to get out of its current engagements in the region, it needs look beyond whether it is worth talking to Iran to simply get a nuclear deal.

In particular they’ve targeted Western academia, a useful object as it allows them to promote their political narratives.</p><p>Since the 2000s, Western universities have received steadily <span><a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/45686282.pdf">increasing</a></span> funding from Gulf Cooperation Council states, directed towards academic centers, student scholarships, academic chairs and fellowships, and donations to archives and museums.</p><p>“By 2008 Saudi Arabia had given UK HEIs £189.8m, £21m to Oxford, £8m to Edinburgh, £8m to Cambridge, £1m to the Oxford Middle East Center at St Antony’s College and a large amount to the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies,” Dr. Anthony Glees, Professor of Politics at the University of Buckingham, who previously researched Gulf funding into Western universities, told LobeLog. Other UK universities like Durham, the London School of Economic and Political Science, and Exeter have since received sizable donations.</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. universities have received $2.2 billion from Gulf states since the beginning of 2012, <span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fa6d15a4-f6ed-11e8-af46-2022a0b02a6c">according</a></span> to a Financial Times analysis. MIT, for instance, received numerous Saudi donations. Among these were <span><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/MIT-Offers-Harsh-Words-for/245621">$25 million in March 2018</a></span> from Saudi Aramco, for research in renewable energy and artificial intelligence. The university also <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/magazine/saudi-arabia-american-universities.html?register=facebook&amp;auth=register-facebook">received</a></span> individual gifts from Saudi billionaires totaling as much as $43 million. Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, Stanford, and the California Institute of Technology are other elite U.S. universities that have received Saudi financing. These investments have largely focused on Western Middle East Studies centers. Virtually <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/beware-gulf-stream">every</a></span> Middle East department in the West has some Gulf funding.</p><p>One mechanism for this funding is state-linked foundations. </p><p>Dr. Madawi al-Rasheed, visiting Professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said that Saudi Arabia expects support for its policies in return for its funding. It blames criticism on research funded by its regional rivals. “Western academic institutions defend their objectivity by claiming that they remain objective despite the funding,” she said. “But this will be difficult to sustain, as Saudi funding may be cut if activities at such centers are deemed hostile [to] or critical of Saudi Arabia.”</p><p><span><a href="https://lobelog.com/saudi-arabia-and-the-uae-fund-academia-with-strings-attached/">https://lobelog.com/saudi-arabia-and-the-uae-fund-academia-with-strings-attached/</a></span></p><p>(B E H)</p><p><span>In pictures: Turning tyres into tables</span></p><p>Soufian Noaman owns a recycling workshop in Sanaa where he and his assistant turn used tyres into furniture</p><p>In Sanaa, Yemen, Soufian Noaman creates unique household furniture from re-purposed tyres, giving them a new lease of life.</p><p>Using mainly bold colours, Noaman combines his love for art and the environment to make one-of-a-kind pieces which he can sell.</p><p>Here, tyres are being painted by Mohamed Noman, an assistant at the workshop.
