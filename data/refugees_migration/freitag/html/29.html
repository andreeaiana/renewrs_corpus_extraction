War and chaos also resulted from the Houthi takeover of Sanaa in 2014, reflecting the clumsy efforts of the United Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council to patch together a new social contract among the various Yemeni factions and regions. None of this was helped with the Saudi-led Arab coalition’s intervention in the country in 2015, ostensibly to repel the Houthi takeover, derail what the Saudis perceived as a growing Iranian menace on their southern border, and restore the internationally recognized government of President Hadi to power. Five years of this war have achieved quite the opposite: the entrenchment of the Houthis in Sanaa, a growing Iranian influence bucking up the Houthis, an increasingly divided country, and a marginalized Hadi government.</p><p>Five years of this war have achieved quite the opposite: the entrenchment of the Houthis in Sanaa, a growing Iranian influence bucking up the Houthis, an increasingly divided country, and a marginalized Hadi government.</p><p>Whatever the agenda of the Saudi and Emirati leadership, it could not have been pursued without the willing participation of Yemeni militias and armies on the ground. To start with, the Hadi government, living in the <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200529-saudi-arabias-puppet-yemen-government-is-hanging-by-a-thread/">lap of luxury courtesy of the Saudi government</a></span>, has been fighting for a secure foothold inside Yemen and has sought to <span><a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2016/09/19/Yemen-moves-central-bank-HQ-to-Aden.html">keep control</a></span> of Yemen’s central bank holdings. However, it has been unable to do that in either Sanaa (which was taken over by the Houthis) or Aden (where the STC challenges it). Hadi loyalists have been fighting in Marib, trying to fend off Houthi attacks to remain in control of oil and gas facilities in the area. The Hadi forces have also complained of inadequate support from Riyadh, especially because they have to fight on at least two fronts: north with the Houthis and south with the STC and other UAE-supported forces trying to form a separate state there. There are <span><a href="https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/saudi-arabias-puppet-hadis-government-is-hanging-by-a-thread/">reports</a></span> of the Saudis’ unhappiness with Hadi’s leadership, that they may be searching for alternatives. Indeed, everyone now questions the Hadi government’s <span><a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/president-hadi-and-future-legitimacy-yemen">legitimacy</a></span> as well as the efficacy of continuing to vest this honor upon him when he, like every other major player in Yemen, is struggling to hold on to land and resources.</p><p>In fact, the <span><a href="http://arabcenterdc.org/policy_analyses/the-riyadh-agreement-on-yemen-arrangements-and-chances-of-success/">Riyadh Agreement</a></span>, purportedly a plan to merge the STC with the Hadi government and put an end to bloodshed and chaos in the south, has been suspect in the eyes of Hadi as well as analysts who see it as an <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/riyadh-agreement-disappointed-hadis-supporters-southern-yemen">abandonment of Hadi</a></span> in favor of the STC. The hostile takeover of Socotra Island is the most recent example of the STC trying to assert southern independence with clear support from the UAE and suspected connivance from Saudi Arabia. There is no military value to the island for the STC, save that of adding territory to what it already controls in the south, in addition to how the island might help the UAE’s maritime ambitions in the Arabian Sea. It represents, however, a significant defeat for the Hadi government and a further squeezing out of their forces from the south. </p><p>If the reported Saudi offer of <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/06/yemen-gov-southern-separatists-agree-ceasefire-arabia-200622152037838.html">a Riyadh Agreement part II</a></span> is true, it would shed even more doubt on Saudi intentions and add credibility to reports of their discontinuing support to President Hadi. This offer evidently suggested the STC withdraw its troops from Aden and into Abyan, with no mention of where Hadi’s forces would be deployed. If implemented—and there is no chance of that happening, in any case—it would mean an expansion of STC influence into Abyan, a contested governorate not currently under their control.</p><p>Under the best of circumstances and assuming good intentions, Saudi and Emirati leaders are under intensifying pressure to cut their losses in Yemen, given the <span><a href="https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/82092">increasing cost of the war</a></span>, lower revenue due to the depressed prices of oil, and the vulnerability of their own countries to rocket attacks and land incursions in southern Saudi Arabia. The management of Yemen, as administered territory, also seems too much of a challenge for the Arab coalition, unless one wants to assume the worst and conclude that the prevalent chaos is exactly what they wanted to achieve</p><p>The sins of the international community</p><p>Since 2011, three successive UN special envoys have failed to stitch together an agreement to reconcile the various parties in conflict and to get the permanent members of the UN Security Council to put their weight behind an effort to end the war. The latest of the envoys, Martin Griffiths, wasted two years trying to secure the neutrality of the vital Hodeida port while the real war raged elsewhere in Yemen and Yemeni and regional parties continued to fundamentally disagree on what a final agreement would look like.</p><p>The United States, guilty by association in the launch of the war in 2015, has failed to fully engage its diplomacy in the service of peace, continuing instead to fuel the fighting with huge arms sales, training of fighter-pilots, and putting in place a missile defense system in an extensive but futile effort to guard against rocket attacks against sensitive targets inside Saudi Arabia. </p><p>Yemen needs Yemenis</p><p>Young men and women from Yemen are now spread far and wide across Europe, the United States, and Asia.

Stopping the fighting is urgent. Diplomats should adopt an inclusive, multiparty framework for talks to replace today’s flawed model.</p><p><span>Executive Summary</span></p><p>After five years of war, the parties to the Yemen conflict face a stark choice: accept a ceasefire and an imperfect political settlement, particularly in light of fears of a growing COVID-19 outbreak, or continue a war that will produce more human suffering but no clear nationwide military victory for any group. A political settlement between the internationally recognised government and the Huthis – the de facto authorities in Sanaa – might once have been able to end the war and return the country to a political transition. But subsequent shifts in the military balance, political and territorial fragmentation, and heavy-handed regional intervention have changed peacemaking requirements. A more inclusive UN-brokered, multiparty settlement is needed, along with interim governance arrangements that avoid rapid recentralisation of power in Sanaa to the benefit of just one or two groups.</p><p>One of the biggest barriers to a settlement is an outdated international approach to ending the war. The government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi holds that any deal must build on the foundations of an April 2015 UN Security Council Resolution (2216) that it interprets as a form of legal summons for the Huthis to surrender, hand over heavy weapons and allow the government to return to rule Yemen from Sanaa. UN-brokered talks in Kuwait in 2016 produced a draft agreement built around Resolution 2216 that has become the framework for subsequent negotiations. The agreement would have led to a power-sharing arrangement that included a minority Huthi role in government and opened a pathway to national elections.</p><p>Much has changed since 2016. The Huthis have consolidated their control over the north west and are threatening the government’s last stronghold in the north – in Marib. They have become increasingly confident of their hold on power in Sanaa and now want a deal that bypasses the Hadi government and recognises de facto realities on the ground, which they believe favour their rule. Aware of its territorial weakness, the government has clung to its legal status and become increasingly resistant to any agreement that might provide its rivals with legitimacy.</p><p>Other shifts on the ground have further complicated matters. Yemen is now roughly divided into five cantons of political and military control: the Huthi-controlled northern highlands; government-aligned areas in Marib, al-Jawf, northern Hadramawt, al-Mahra, Shebwa, Abyan and Taiz city; the pro-separatist Southern Transition Council-dominated territories in Aden and its hinterland; districts along the Red Sea coast where the Joint Resistance Forces are the chief power; and coastal Hadramawt, where local authorities prevail.</p><p>A successful political process will require two things. First, the parties will need to be persuaded that it is in their own interest to abandon maximalist demands. The military balance favours the Huthis, but not to the extent that the group might think. They appear to believe they can broker a deal to end the war directly with Riyadh, but they are fighting an array of adversaries who are unlikely to accept a settlement that does not protect their core interests or to honour one simply because Riyadh demands it.</p><p>An outright military victory for any party, including the Huthis, is highly unlikely. Moreover, the Hadi government, however weak, is still Yemen’s internationally recognised authority. For these reasons, the Huthis should accept that a UN-brokered deal will not simply transfer authority to them and convert territorial realities into international recognition of their rule. In turn, the government should accept that its demands for a return to power in Sanaa through an effective Huthi surrender are wholly unrealistic. For its part, Saudi Arabia will not be able to declare victory in Yemen as leaders in Riyadh may hope. Its demand that the Huthis decouple from Tehran may have to be a longer-term goal rather than a condition of a political settlement.</p><p>Secondly, Yemen’s political and territorial fragmentation demands a rethink of the negotiation framework and the substance of an achievable agreement. There is growing international and Yemeni consensus that the two-party settlement the UN has attempted to broker over the course of the war is unlikely to translate into lasting peace. It is increasingly clear that the UN must open talks up, at a minimum to ensure the buy-in of powerful groups such as the secessionist Southern Transitional Council (STC), which are capable of upending any settlement. The current approach also leaves out tribal groups, local authorities and a range of political parties, women’s and youth groups and other civil society actors whose support will be invaluable in sustaining an agreement.</p><p>The content of an agreement will need to address new realities and acknowledge past mistakes. Local groups prize autonomy won over the course of the war and will resist a rush to recentralise the state in Sanaa. Failure to address the social and economic grievances that sparked Yemen’s 2011 popular uprising, and contributed to the Huthis’ rise, would invite future instability and war.</p><p>At one time or another over the course of this war, each side has overestimated its ability to achieve maximalist aims, only to suffer major setbacks. Finding a mutually acceptable deal today will not lead to any party’s preferred settlement, but will almost certainly be better than what may be available after years more of conflict.</p><p>Appendix A: Maps of Yemen National Divisions and Key Front Lines</p><p><span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/216-rethinking-peace-yemen">https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/216-rethinking-peace-yemen</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Political transitions in southern Yemen.. From dream of unity to fragmentation</strong></p><p>The research deals with the most important political transformations in southern Yemen in the period of (1990-2020). In its preface, this research addresses the south in the period prior to unity with the north, the period that followed the liberation of the south from the British colonialism and the declaration of its independence on 30th of November 1967, until the declaration of unity in 1990. It deals with circumstances and challenges that affected the political, economic, cultural, and social path of the southern state.</p><p>The preface includes the topic of relationship between south and north Yemen before achieving the unity, and the conditions that prevailed during that period. The relationship between north and south witnessed many changes and it was strained so that conflict broke out between the two parts twice and then the situation developed positively into internal and external deals that led to the establishment of the Yemeni unity.</p><p>The research sheds the light on the most prominent factors of change in Yemen in general and in the south in particular, negatively or positively, with reference to the political forces that contributed, in one way or another, to that change - not to ignore the circumstances, consequences and repercussions during the period targeted in this research. The transformations include the Yemeni unity, the war that followed, the most important stages of political conflict and wars, the popular revolution - the Yemeni version of the Arab Spring that led to the power transition and the holding of the National Dialogue Conference, and then the coup, led by the Houthis and its allies , which led to a comprehensive war that has not yet ended, despite the fact that five years have passed since its outbreak.</p><p>The importance of this topic comes in the context of transformations that Yemen experienced in general and studying all its aspects in order to get a knowledge of the situation that can dismantle the structures that have been semi-closed for a long period of time, and to clearly read the current reality and the local, regional and international circumstances, as well as the consequences.</p><p>To achieve the desired goals, the researcher used the historical method to track historical changes and events, as well as the descriptive and analytical approach being the closest and most useful in dealing with the topic and presenting its contents through description and analysis.</p><p>Riyadh agreement and future scenarios:</p><p>The Riyadh Agreement has become the most prominent determinant of relationship between the two main parties in southern Yemen, which are the internationally recognized legitimate government that enjoys the support and patronage of Saudi Arabia, and the transitional council, supported by the Emirates. In light of the agreement, many circumstances in the south became clear, and the future situation can be easily predicted. As long as the terms of the agreement are not translated into reality, several scenarios are expected:</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>Whatever the scenario that is likely to happen in a complex situation like Yemen, particularly the southern Yemen that witnessed armed and bloody conflicts with mainly regional dimension, in addition to political and ideological conflict that has deepened with the presence of regional and international polarizations, a secure and safe separation through the Transitional Council is unlikely to happen. The transitional is only part of the Southern Movement and it does not represent all entities of the south. It does not enjoy momentum in some southern governorates, including Abyan, Shabwa, Hadramawt, al-Mahrah and Socotra, which means that any separation now will develop into a cycle of internal conflict that may divide the south into small states, and a battlefield for regional and international powers.</p><p><span><a href="https://abaadstudies.org/news-59844.html">https://abaadstudies.org/news-59844.html</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Performative Humanitarianism: Saudi’s Aid Diplomacy in Yemen</strong></p><p>Saudi Aid as a Soft Power</p><p>Through these aid efforts, Saudi Arabia aims to present the international community with a more positive image of itself. Riyadh has faced pressure from Washington and European capitals regarding its role in Yemen, particularly after its offensive on the Hodeida governorate in June 2018. Many countries including Norway, Germany, Belgium, and Denmark even suspended weapons sales to Saudi Arabia following <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32677260">reports</a></span> that the Saudi-led coalition was hitting civilian areas. The UN also repeatedly the country for its actions in Yemen’s war.</p><p>Given this context, <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/saudi-arabia-to-co-host-un-fundraising-summit-for-yemen">h</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/saudi-arabia-to-co-host-un-fundraising-summit-for-yemen">umanitarian organizations</a></span>, therefore, criticized the fundraiser conference as “throwing money” at Yemen without pushing for a peace solution and ending the war. Yet international policymakers, including those attending the conference, were receptive towards Riyadh’s gestures. Saudi Prince Faisal bin Farhan al Saud said he “supports the UN efforts to reach a political solution in Yemen to alleviate the suffering and support humanitarian, economic and developmental aspects”.</p><p>Meanwhile, the state-owned Saudi Development and Reconstruction Program for Yemen (SDRPY), which has carried out various projects across the country throughout the last two years, has been a useful tool for Saudi Arabia to further bolster its international humanitarian credentials. On May 14, the organization attended a <span><a href="https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/593179/SAUDI-ARABIA/World-Bank-discusses-SDRPYs-efforts-in-Yemen-reconstruction">virtual meeting</a></span> hosted by the World Bank, which reviewed the efforts of international institutions involved in Yemen’s aid and reconstruction while discussing ways to mitigate the pandemic’s impact in the country.</p><p>The World Bank’s praise of the SDRPY legitimizes its actions on an international scale. Meanwhile, it has also <span><a href="https://www.sdrpy.gov.sa/en/media-center/news/effort-paves-way-more-development-and-reconstruction-yemen-following-riyadh">worked</a></span> with other international agencies like the Islamic Development Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP). Rather than solving Yemen’s humanitarian crisis, the SDPRY helps Saudi Arabia secure greater political and economic influence over Yemen.</p><p>Last October SDPRY <span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/saudi-development-and-reconstruction-program-for-yemen-delegation-meets-with-international-agencies-300936746.html">announced</a></span> 70 new projects for “building and restoring critical infrastructure, increasing job opportunities, improving standards of living, empowering Yemenis, and ultimately paving the way toward peace and prosperity in Yemen.”</p><p>Unable to defeat Iran-backed Houthis militarily, Saudi Arabia now aims to isolate the faction which controls much of northern Yemen, mostly focusing its projects on areas beyond Houthi control. As the Houthis control the Hodeida port, through which around 80% of Yemen’s aid and imports pass, Saudi Arabia previously tried to redirect aid towards southern ports under nominal Hadi control like Aden, Mukalla and Mokha. The International Rescue Committee <span><a href="https://www.rescue.org/press-release/yemen-saudi-aid-plan-war-tactic">described</a></span> this move as a “war tactic”. Saudi Arabia still has not fully lifted its blockade on Hodeida, which restricts essential supplies from entering the country, despite highlighting its humanitarian efforts.</p><p>Contrasting Aid Strategies with the UAE</p><p>Meanwhile, Riyadh’s coalition ally, the United Arab Emirates, donated nothing to Yemen in the fundraising conference, despite its heavy involvement in the conflict and its backing of a Yemeni political party. It seeks control over Yemen’s southern ports in order to bring the country into its sphere of influence and establish itself as a maritime trade powerhouse across the Indian Ocean, while also pursuing control over the strategic Bab el Mandeb at the mouth of the Red Sea. Securing a friendly independent southern state would facilitate these goals.</p><p>What is certain, however, is that, unlike Saudi Arabia, the UAE has not relied on aid for its strategy in Yemen. Rather, it has prioritized its pretext of counter-terrorism to justify exerting its influence. Moreover, as a younger actor in the country, it has focused more on acquiring Yemen’s ports, contrasting with Saudi Arabia’s traditional ideological motives and desires to influence its southern neighbour.

In 2014, he was found guilty of murdering a man and robbing his home, and was sent to Taiz city's central prison to await his execution.</p><p>But Houthi forces backed by troops loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, the country's former president, swept into Taiz on 22 March 2015, capturing the military airport and other key parts of the city.</p><p>Fighting eventually reached Fares' prison in June of that year and hundreds of prisoners, including Fares, were able to flee the jail amid the clashes.</p><p>Many of the fugitive prisoners did not return to their homes but instead took part in the fighting in Taiz. </p><p>Fares joined and fought alongside the Saudi-backed pro-government forces in Taiz for around two years.</p><p>Despite ceasefires and prisoner swaps, the battle for the city continues to this day.</p><p>Fares then joined the fighting for another two years as a mercenary on the Saudi border to help protect the kingdom from the Houthis. He then returned to his village near Taiz in 2019, portraying himself as a military leader.</p><p>Remembering his criminal past, none of his village's residents dared to challenge him.</p><p>After a few months, Fares, now in his 40s, used his money to gather several armed men around him and impose himself as a sheik of his hometown and the surrounding villages.</p><p>Some of Fares' friends, who had also who returned from fighting on the Saudi border, started to do the same in their areas nearby.</p><p>With a monthly wage of 6,000 Yemeni rials ($800), mercenaries fighting on the border can easily outspend conventional Yemeni soldiers, who earn a tenth of that. Recruiting fighters for their entourage is easily done.</p><p>The returnees also support each other and have built good relationship with the security offices in their areas, as they have friends there.</p><p>And so a network of former mercenaries was set up, imposing a number of militias on Taiz's war-weary people.</p><p>'They were going to kill me'</p><p>At first, Fares recruited around 10 armed guards, less than a normal Yemeni sheik would have. He then looked for land owned by vulnerable people who did not have any men to help protect it.</p><p>“I’ve been farming my land since I was a child as I inherited it from my father. And now the so-called sheik, with his gang members, have taken it,” Ahmed*, a resident of Taiz in his 60s, told Middle East Eye.</p><p>“I tried to prevent them but they shot at me and they were going to kill me. As you can see, I’m an old man and my sons are educated men, so they can’t face armed men.”</p><p>Ahmed told MEE that he prays Allah will take revenge on Fares and his men, as he has no one who can help him.</p><p>Armed men can be seen everywhere in Taiz, and since the militias are stronger than the local army units, no one can prevent what is happening.</p><p>“I went to our sheik to complain but he told me that he isn’t the sheik anymore, and he wants to live in peace as my enemy [Fares] is a savage man,” said Ahmed.</p><p>His village is far from where Fares lives, but he commandeered his land nonetheless, as it is located near the village's main street and is valuable.</p><p>“I went to the thief himself and told him that’s my land and that he doesn't even belong to the village so how he could he now own my land,” said Ahmed. </p><p>“He told me that he bought this land from a friend on the Saudi border. It is a ridiculous pretext.”</p><p>Ahmed decided to complain to the local security office the next day but was shocked to find that Fares’ friend was in charge there as he was a “revolutionist”, a term for someone who has fought against the Houthis.</p><p>“We used to think that the security office supported oppressed people, or at least looked at their complaints. But when I told the officer that I was complaining against Fares, he immediately said ‘this sheik doesn’t loot lands’,” he recalled.</p><p>As Ahmed left the office, he met dozens of people outside who had similar issues against Fares or other gang leaders who had taken their lands and houses but had no one to help them.</p><p>“It is strange that thugs now control Taiz under the pretext of defending Taiz from the Houthis,” said Ahmed.</p><p>However, hundreds of killers, thieves and other criminals joined the fighting but then returned home to resume their crimes, this time with increased violence. </p><p>Those who have fought against the Houthis consider themselves liberators of Taiz, and their stature intimidates anyone who wishes they could be confronted.</p><p>The government and army's toothlessness in the face of such flagrant abuses and theft has left the people of Taiz angry and exasperated. Some are even hoping the Houthis retake Taiz and end this lawlessness.</p><p>“The Houthis are in charge in their bits of the country and there is security, a judiciary and courts, and no one dares to loot the property of people in this savage way,” Amin said.</p><p>“Those thugs say they are liberators but in fact they are thieves, so I hope that the Houthis take over Taiz and liberate us from them.”</p><p>Ahmed, who lost his land to Fares, also hopes that the Houthis take over Taiz. </p><p>“We don’t hear about such gangs in the Houthi-controlled areas and no one will take revenge for us but the Houthis," he said.</p><p>“I pray Allah will free us from those thugs and support the Houthis to take over Taiz."</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-taiz-saudi-mercenaries-terrorise-criminals">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-taiz-saudi-mercenaries-terrorise-criminals</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Revealed: Hundreds of Saudi and Gulf military personnel trained in Britain as Yemen war continues</strong></p><p>New data shows Britain’s Royal Air Force trained Saudi personnel in 2019 on fighter jets used to bomb civilians in Yemen – a country on the brink of famine – while UK soldiers coached other forces in the Saudi-led coalition at nearly a dozen army bases in Britain.</p><p>Hundreds of Saudi military personnel received training at Royal Air Force (RAF) bases in the UK in 2019 – the same year a court banned new exports of British-made weapons to Saudi Arabia over human rights concerns in the Yemen war.</p><p>Data obtained by <em>Declassified UK</em> from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) shows that 310 Saudis trained at six RAF sites in England and Wales last year.

We put our lives at risk to save the lives of our people. I have seen many doctors fall sick and be admitted to be put on ventilators and monitors, or worse, die.

It made me aware of the magnitude of the needs in Yemen, and of my role to play as a health care worker,” he adds.</p><p>We are in this together</p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in Yemen, Dr Sami received calls and messages from many people on social media worried about the virus and what it meant to them and their families. This made him think of the people working on the streets who don’t have phones or internet and who need medical guidance.</p><p>So he decided to start a unique initiative. He printed a poster offering people in the community to stop him for a free consultation if they needed to and placed it at the back of his car.</p><p>“People are scared. Many are unable to stay quarantined due to their financial situation. So they go out to their jobs knowing they are at high risk of infection. I wanted to be closer to them – easier to reach – whenever needed, to discuss a medical issue,” he said.</p><p>“I was quite surprised at how people reacted to the poster. It made me happy. In the more disadvantaged areas, I would have 30 people stop me in one day.” He adds. “Of course, I am not providing medical services, all I am doing is providing medical consultation services and referring them to the medical facilities where they can access medical support.”</p><p>This initiative reminded Dr Sami of the importance of the role health care workers play in the community, especially during a pandemic.</p><p>“I understand the fear of health care workers. It is a justified fear given the deteriorating health situation. But our people need us and our experience.

"Yemeni tribes will call for tribal Nakaf and declare war on the Abidah tribes because the crime was a black shame on all the tribes in Marib in general and the Abidah in particular".<br />Last week, pro-government forces backed by tribal fighters engaged in battles against a tribal elder and a group of his fans in the province. Seven persons were killed in the battles.<br />At the time, the Houthi Group said Al-Qaeda and Daesh armed with tanks and military vehicles attacked the area of Al-Khashah, shelled houses and killed seven civilians including sheikh Mohsen Subayian in the Abidah Valley.<br />From their side, the government forces accused the sheikh of forming a ring spying for the Houthis, planting landmines and explosive devices on supply routes, mostly in the area of Al-Alam along the border with Jawf province, as well as smuggling spare parts of drones for the Houthis through the desert.<br />Large military equipment, Houthi documents and materials to produce drones were found at the ring's site, they said.<br />The developments come amid continued military escalation between the government and Houthi forces on the outskirts of Marib.</p><p><span><a href="https://debriefer.net/en/news-18244.html">https://debriefer.net/en/news-18244.html</a></span></p><p><span>and also <a href="https://debriefer.net/en/news-18273.html">https://debriefer.net/en/news-18273.html</a></span></p><p><span>(B H K P)</span></p><p><span>Audio: </span>Save the malnourished children in Yemen</p><p>Five years of illegal war on Yemen has had its toll on civilian infrastructure as well, including schools, hospitals and markets, thanks largely to the indiscriminate airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition, backed by the United States and NATO partners.</p><p><span><a href="https://parstoday.com/en/radio/programs-i123436-save_the_malnourished_children_in_yemen">https://parstoday.com/en/radio/programs-i123436-save_the_malnourished_children_in_yemen</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H K)</span></p><p>Children under the gun in Yemen</p><p>Every year, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres releases his “name and shame” list of countries that are complicit in attacks on or mistreatment of children during times of conflict.

The 5-year war has so far left 335 reporters killed and 25 others injured.<br />According to the report, the coalition has damaged 23 media institutions and 30 broadcasting towers.<br />The recently-developed report accuses the coalition of reduplicating 6 channels and websites, stopping the broadcasting of 8 TVs, jamming 7 other satellites, hacking 3 websites, and making two official papers stop.<br />The coalition in the fifth year of war denied 143 international reporters entry to Yemen and stopped tens of accounts on Facebook, Twitter and U-tube, the report read.<br />The fourth estate staff in Yemen remain victimized by all warring parties (the official government and the Houthis), who may have forgotten the various Yemeni activists and journalists forcibly disappeared inside Saudi Arabia, with the government lifting no finger.</p><p>The Yemeni journalist Marwan al-Muraisi is a victim of the forced disappearances in Saudi prisons. He has been detained for two years with no charge or trial.<br />Following the Houthi overthrow of Sana'a, activists fled Houthi detention to Saudi Arabia where they have suffered arbitrary practices by security authorities, in violation of human rights.</p><p><span><a href="https://debriefer.net/en/news-18231.html">https://debriefer.net/en/news-18231.html</a></span></p><p><span>(B K P)</span></p><p>Time for US to Pull Out of Yemen</p><p>Whatever this is, it’s time for Washington to end its criminal involvement in Yemen war, but, crucially, the United Nations should also step in to have a say in all this, because the House resolution or bill is nonbinding; it is only a small step forward, and the shift in US foreign policy is not going to happen overnight.</p><p>That means the US will likely continue to assist Saudi Arabia by refuelling its planes and providing intelligence in Riyadh’s brutal air war against the defenceless population of Yemen. The US will also continue to sell weapons to Riyadh worth billions and accuse Others of supporting the Ansarullah movement in order to hide its complicity in Saudi war crimes and defuse international criticism.</p><p>As maintained by many US officials and Pentagon commanders, the US-backed Saudi-led war on Yemen is unwinnable – despite the attempts by Riyadh to escalate the war even further. Five years into this unnecessary bloodshed should be more than enough for the War Party to reach conclusion that what it has on its hands is yet another endless war that like the one in Afghanistan is unwinnable.</p><p>Under the prevailing environment, the United Nations Security Council must hold Saudi Arabia and the United States responsible for their repeated and blatant violations of International Law and International Humanitarian Law in Yemen.</p><p>The world body should force the Saudis to accept a non-military solution to the war.

The war crimes committed by Saudi Arabia and its allies against the Yemeni people are not only unforgivable, but it is an undeniable necessity for the continued efforts of international human rights organizations, as well as UN agencies, to immediately stop Saudi Arabia’s inhumane acts. The war-mongering and inhumane actions of the Saudi regime and its belligerent allies in recent years, and the continuation of the belligerent and interventionist approach of the Saudi leaders, have exacerbated the plight of the oppressed people and put the oppressed Yemeni people in more trouble.</p><p>Twenty-four European countries, expressed concern on Monday, September ,<span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/24/eu-nations-lead-condemnation-of-saudi-human-rights-record">2019</a></span>, about the torture, illegal detention and unfair trial of critics, including women activists in Saudi Arabia. The other focus of the Western statement is concerns about reports of torture, arbitrary detention, forced disappearances, unfair trials and harassment of human rights activists in Saudi Arabia.<span> In fact, the recent publication of 24 Western countries is a sign of a vague policy towards the Saudi regime.</span>Major European countries such as <span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-sells-arms-to-members-of-saudi-led-yemen-coalition/a-53000044">Germany</a></span>, France and Britain have apparently condemned the Saudi regime for human rights abuses, while having extensive military and weapons ties with Riyadh. Therefore, it can be said that these countries, despite their claims about special attention to human rights, have turned a blind eye to the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia and the Saudi regime’s illegal and inhumane actions.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, along with its warring allies with its inhumane crimes against the oppressed people of Yemen, not only ignores the current unfavorable situation and the increase in casualties in the country, but also continues its anti-human rights actions. While everyone is waiting for the Western governments to work to prevent these inhumane acts in Yemen, it seems that these countries are not taking any effective action to stop the inhumane actions of the Saudis and their Emirati partners in Yemen because of their material interests, and especially the interests of the major arms companies. Accordingly, it is not only Saudi Arabia that violates human rights in Yemen, but other seemingly pro-human rights governments, including France and Germany which continue to sell their weapons, violate human rights as much as Saudis do.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.newsgram.com/violations-human-rights-yemen-continuation-saudi-crimes/amp/">https://www.newsgram.com/violations-human-rights-yemen-continuation-saudi-crimes/amp/</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>Iran zu saudischer Koalition im Jemen: Ehre und Ansehen sind nicht kaufbar</span></p><p><span>Die iranische Botschaft in Frankreich hat die Verbrechen der von Saudi-Arabien geführte Kriegskoalition im Jemen kritisiert.</span></p><p><span>Ehre, Prestige und das Ansehen werden in der heutigen Welt können nicht mehr gekauft, hieß es in einem Tweet, das die iranischen Botschaft in Paris gestern veröffentlichte.</span></p><p><span>Die iranische Botschaft veröffentlichte zudem einige Bilder von der Lage des jemenitischen Volkes und der durch die Angriffe der saudischen Koalition verursachten Schäden und betonte: "Die Ära, in der Sicherheit nur durch militärische Macht garantiert und definiert werden konnte, ist vorbei".</span></p><p><span><a href="https://parstoday.com/de/news/iran-i52619-iran_zu_saudischer_koalition_im_jemen_ehre_und_ansehen_sind_nicht_kaufbar">https://parstoday.com/de/news/iran-i52619-iran_zu_saudischer_koalition_im_jemen_ehre_und_ansehen_sind_nicht_kaufbar</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>No Crisis is an Island: How the GCC Crisis Shapes the War in Yemen</p><p>The GCC crisis was born in June 2017 when Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain <span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dc24473c-499e-11e7-a3f4-c742b9791d43">cut</a></span> ties with Doha and imposed a multifaceted blockade.

These command and control structures are not controlled by the Yemeni government, which meant that even though the UAE withdrew, it retains tangible control over local proxies and partners thought to exceed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/uae-drawdown-in-yemen-raises-hopes-of-ceasefire-this-year-idUSKCN1UJ17R">90,000 personnel</a>, which have the power to shape conflict and peace trajectories.</p><p>With this complicated political landscape, the Riyadh deal and its stalled implementation exemplify Saudi’s dilemma.

Initiatives for serious negotiations have to come from within as international players can only broker a peace deal. Oman is strongly seen as a potential mediator as it has maintained positive relations with all key sides—internal and external—in Yemen’s ongoing conflict. </p><p>United Nations Human Rights Commission formed a group of eminent experts (GEE) on the region of Yemen to look into possible crimes at the hands of rebel forces, the state and Saudi Arabia. The report states that all stakeholders and affiliated popular committees have enjoyed a “pervasive lack of accountability” for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The fighting has left over 1500 civilians dead, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates.</p><p>Mr. Kamel Jendoubi, chairperson of the Group of Experts on Yemen says that there has been a lack of international action to hold all parties to the conflict equally accountable. UK, USA and France may have been calling for a halt on armed aggression. However, they continue to supplying weapons to middle eastern countries which feeds the never-ending cycle of violence. The United Nations Security Council has extended the arms embargo against the Rebel Forces. The one-sided Embargo was criticised as it in a way legitimised airstrike on Yemen. Which goes against the collective responsibility that all parties have for the humanitarian crisis. The <span><a href="https://osesgy.unmissions.org/year-after-stockholm-agreement-where-are-we-now">Stockholm agreement</a></span> has achieved only moderate success in the city of Hodaydah till now. It itself cannot be expected to cease military offence with Rebels. The violence continues, so does the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Brokering an End to The World’s Worst Crisis</p><p>The people, especially children, women and the youth of Yemen have seen the worst of humanitarian crisis and apathy of international organisations and foreign countries. For the humanitarian crisis to end, attempts to restore peace must be made. Peace would ensure ideal conditions for humanitarian, legal and economic structures to prosper. These are an essential prerequisite for ensuring justice, freedom and transparency in the country. For peace to exist in Yemen, it should not be used as a proxy for any other regional reasons by any regional power. To show that, they need to keep their connection with Yemen exclusive to the state. The involvement of Iran and Saudi Arabia in Yemen’s domestic conflict only adds a sectarian flavour to the conflict making it more intractable.</p><p>A peaceful society can only be built from the ground by engaging, locals, tribal groups, civil societies and activist. Houthis have been marginalised in the internal politics of the country for a very long time. they surely enjoy significant support of the common public. Therefore, an attempt to restore peace cannot be made without bringing their demands to the table. The grass root level needs of tribal groups must be given their due share in governance. Yemeni authority and International players have so far failed to distinguish between terrorism and insurgency. The current instability then ends up being exploited by malicious groups like Al-Qaida, Al Nusra, Boko Haram, among others.</p><p>The humanitarian crisis shows us that those who suffer the most in a war are the unarmed, non-combatant civilians. The repercussions are more painful than the war itself because they leave a long-term impact on society and its people. UNSC and other agencies must look beyond sanctions. The humanitarian aid is only temporary and the long-term solution would come from the positive political engagement between the Yemeni authority and the various tribal groups along with the Houthis.

A short-lived ceasefire signaled that warring parties in the conflict are seeking a resolution, however, the panelists claim that deep mistrust, ineffectual international institutions, and strategic considerations are among the factors that continue to prolong fighting. While internal disputes and international patrons give the war a complex appearance, the experts identify the core political issues at stake and what is required for Yemen to recover.</p><p>The Perpetual War</p><p>Samuel Ramani opened discussion with a presentation on the international dimension to the conflict, arguing that a paradox has emerged whereby the major actors in Yemen exhibit a desire for a peace resolution, yet are locked in a cycle of violence fueled by mistrust and the absence of an effective peace arbitrer. According to Ramani, the credibility and legitimacy of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is bound up in a war campaign he oversaw as defense minister that risks placing Saudi Arabia in a worse position from where it began in 2015. The Houthis and Iran have sensed the Saudi’s growing vulnerability, which has deepened their relationship and offered Iran a strategic foothold on the Bab el-Mandeb strait and a permanent check on Saudi Arabia’s southern border.</p><p>Meanwhile, the efforts of the United Nations to reach a resolution are unpopular among Yemeni political leaders and the Yemeni people. There is dissatisfaction with Special Envoy Martin Griffiths, yet no attractive alternative to the UN-led process despite interest from neighboring Gulf states and Europe to see an end to the war. This is in part a consequence of the polarity present today in the international community as well as mixed messaging coming from Yemeni leaders over an acceptable outcome. President Hadi has alluded to a future federal system while also emphasizing national unity, which in Yemen’s fragmented political landscape of tribal politics and sectarianism has encouraged local groups to develop their own visions for Yemen’s future.</p><p>The US Role in the Saudi Campaign</p><p>Following Samuel Ramani’s analysis of the wider international dimension to Yemen’s war, Professor David Des Roches narrows the focus on the role of the United States in supporting Saudi Arabia’s military operations. Professor Des Roches is clear to indicate that US military support for Saudi Arabia is only one angle to a highly internationalized conflict, although the relationship is a critical aspect to the war. While American assistance to the Saudi campaign initially came from air-to-air refuelling of Saudi jets, the US today is the top provider of munitions used primarily for ground operations and defense system technologies. For Des Roches, the evolution highlights a shift from Saudi Arabia’s ‘shock and awe’ approach to Yemen through airstrikes to a proxy war fought on the frontlines.</p><p>The Limits of Peace Processes</p><p>While the UN-facilitated Stockholm Agreement in 2018 renewed optimism for a negotiated settlement to Yemen’s war, Rasha Jarhum reflects on the failure of previous peace discussions and their effect on the Yemeni people’s attitudes toward a lasting future peace. </p><p>A Broken Coalition?</p><p>In examining the status of the Saudi-Emirati coalition that intervened in Yemen with confidence, Dr. Nabeel Khoury concludes that the coalition has failed despite its military superiority. Moreover, the situation in Yemen appears worse as the coalition looks no closer to achieving its aims of restoring legitimacy and establishing security in the region</p><p><span><a href="https://gulfif.org/event-recap-after-five-years-of-war-how-can-yemenis-restore-their-state-and-sovereignty/">https://gulfif.org/event-recap-after-five-years-of-war-how-can-yemenis-restore-their-state-and-sovereignty/</a></span></p><p>(B P)</p><p>[from 2015] The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) As Its Place in Regional Security Complex and Its Challenges of Two Cases: Bahrain and Yemen</p><p>The Gulf Cooperation Council is an active organization in the Arabian Peninsula also in the Persian Gulf which seeks cooperation with the member states.

The 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Needs Overview estimated that over two thirds of Yemenis were in need of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)-related assistance, with 12.6 million of those in acute need of support.</p><p>Due to a lack of comprehensive, nationwide WASH needs assessment data, the Yemen WASH Cluster (YWC) initiated this Secondary Desk Review (SDR) to collate existing information related to WASH needs in Yemen. The main objective of the SDR is to better understand the severity of WASH needs across the country, as well as the underlying causes of these needs, in order to inform appropriate response planning and resource mobilization.<br />Findings will also be used to inform the calculation of the WASH People in Need (PIN) and district severity score figures for 2020. This SDR was conducted jointly by REACH and the YWC in collaboration with ACAPS.</p><p>In order to analyse the severity of WASH needs, the following four steps were undertaken.

The project has helped 2,100 people gain access to disposable income and 10,000 people with access to sustainable energy.</p><p>In a country where women do not enjoy equal status, especially in the realm of work, this not only provides them with an opportunity to provide their families with food, shelter, medicine and other vital supplies, it allows them to have a voice in community decision making and to gain community respect. Rural women launching their own business is a remarkably rare undertaking in the country. “The project was not easy to get off the ground,” says Project Lead, Eman Hadi. “We went through a lot to establish this project because of the perspective Yemenis have on working women,” she indicated.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/news/2020/UNDP_Yemen_wins_acclaimed_international_Ashden_Awards_for_humanitarian_Energy.html">https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/news/2020/UNDP_Yemen_wins_acclaimed_international_Ashden_Awards_for_humanitarian_Energy.html</a></span></p><p><span>Film: </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_fJagitPSE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_fJagitPSE</a></span></p><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p><span>Austria: </span>Foreign Minister Schallenberg: “Austria is providing urgently needed aid to Yemen”</p><p>In the Council of Ministers on 30 June 2020, the Federal Government decided to allocate 1 million euros from the Foreign Disaster Fund (FDF) for Yemen.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/the-ministry/press/announcements/2020/06/foreign-minister-schallenberg-austria-is-providing-urgently-needed-aid-to-yemen/">https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/the-ministry/press/announcements/2020/06/foreign-minister-schallenberg-austria-is-providing-urgently-needed-aid-to-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Yemen: Humanitarian Access Snapshot (March - April 2020)</p><p>Humanitarian partners reported 1,064 access incidents in March and April across 49 districts in 16 governorates in Yemen.</p><p>During the reporting period, armed hostilities continued in the border areas of Marib,<br />Sana’a and Al Jawf governorates.

Travel permits such as for the delivery of assistance and services were also denied, despite compliance to appropriate social distancing protocols by aid agencies. These restrictions affected both regular programmes and scale up of COVID-19 response.</p><p>Since mid-March, the movement of humanitarian personnel and cargo into the country has also been disrupted by new regulations in Yemen and embarkation countries against COVID-19. </p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-access-snapshot-march-april-2020">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-access-snapshot-march-april-2020</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Yemeni Development Network for NGOs: Annual Report 2019</p><p>Yemeni Development Network for NGOs is a leading non-profit, non-governmental Yemeni organisation that was established in 2003.

For about a decade, YDN has successfully accomplished its goals in improving local CSOs' abilities and gained broader comprehension and active participation. YDN's excellence is further enhanced by its apparent existence all around the country, having 13 branches in 13 governorates and co-ordinating offices in the rest of the governorates.

Al-Houthi gave them what he believed is an honorary title, "the ancestors of Bilal." In Islam's history, Bilal was an Abyssinian black companion of prophet Mohammed. The Houthi title was widely met with distrust among black and white activists alike in Yemen and seen as a flattery in the context of his speech and racist recruitment campaigns on the ground.</p><p>Among the commenters was the chief of the national Union of the Marginalized People in Yemen Noaman al-Hudheifi.</p><p>Al-Hudheifi said: "The day before, the leader of the Houthis pretended he wants to integrate the 'ancestors of Bilal' into the society but now has prodded his men to recruit the black from their crumbling huts [to the warfronts and then] to the Cemetery of the Martyrs, instead of the mansions of the happy elite in Aljiraf in Sana'a."</p><p>Although there is no enlistment data about the Houthi guerilla, Yemeni NGOs, activists and army sources continuously talk of black Yemenis and African immigrants being exploited as favorable targets for the Houthi recruiting drive.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-40586">https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-40586</a></span></p><p>My remark: By an anti-Houthi, pro-Islah Party news site.</p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>7,109 child soldiers recruited in Houthi-held areas</span></p><p>The Iran-backed Houthi putschist militia has recruited children from schools and used them as soldiers in armed conflicts, well-informed Yemeni sources told the local press on Saturday.<br />The same sources affirmed that 7,109 child soldiers had been recruited by the Houthis in five provinces under their control.</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/23472">http://en.adenpress.news/news/23472</a></span></p><p><span>My comment: They evidently had recruited many. A figure by “</span>well-informed Yemeni sources” anyway is BS.</p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Religious preachers in Sanaa condemn coalition crimes against civilians in Yemen</p><p>Religious preachers in mosques in the capital Sanaa strongly condemned the crimes committed by the US-backed Saudi-led aggression coalition and its mercenaries against the Yemeni people.<br />The preachers considered the crimes would be added to the criminal record of the forces of aggression and mercenaries against citizens in a flagrant violation of customs, charters, international humanitarian and human rights law.<br />They held the United Nations and human rights organizations responsible for the crimes committed by the aggression coalition and its mercenaries against the Yemeni peop</p><p><span><a href="https://en.abna24.com/news/religious-preachers-in-sanaa-condemn-coalition-crimes-against-civilians-in-yemen_1052357.html">https://en.abna24.com/news//religious-preachers-in-sanaa-condemn-coalition-crimes-against-civilians-in-yemen_1052357.html</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Four Yemeni detained journalists listed among ten most urgent cases</p><p>The One Press Coalition listed on Wednesday four Yemeni journalists among ten most urgent cases whose status demand justice.</p><p>The four listed journalists are being detained by the Houthis rebels since 2015 and they are at risk of execution any moment after the rebels ruled them to death last April.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-40584">https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-40584</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Yemen: international leaders call on Houthis to release Bahai prisoners</p><p>Iran-backed rebels promised to release six Bahai members in March but they remain behind bars</p><p>Global figures are calling on Yemen’s Houthi rebels to immediately release members of the Bahai community who are being held in prisons and are at high risk of contracting Covid-19.</p><p>The Iran-backed rebels announced in March that they would release Bahai leader Hamed bin Haydara and another five Bahai detainees, but they remain behind bars.</p><p>Since then rebels have ignored international calls to release the detained men.</p><p>“We join members of the International Religious Freedom Alliance in calling on the Houthis to follow through on their March announcement to release the six Bahai prisoners of conscience in their custody, particularly given the heightened risk posed by the spread of Covid-19,” Sam Brownback, the US Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, said on Twitter.</p><p>Mr Brownback’s call was reiterated by Jos Douma, the Netherland’s Special Envoy for religion and belief who said the detainees are at high risk of contracting the disease.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/yemen-international-leaders-call-on-houthis-to-release-bahai-prisoners-1.1043298">https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/yemen-international-leaders-call-on-houthis-to-release-bahai-prisoners-1.1043298</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fortsetzung / Sequel: cp6 – cp18</span></h2><p><strong><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-664b-yemen-war-mosaic-664b">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-664b-yemen-war-mosaic-664b</a> </strong></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vorige / Previous:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-663-yemen-war-mosaic-663">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-663-yemen-war-mosaic-663</a> </p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 1-663 / Yemen War Mosaic 1-663:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose</a> oder / or <a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Der saudische Luftkrieg im Bild / Saudi aerial war images:</span></h2><p><span>(18 +, Nichts für Sensible!) / (18 +; Graphic!)</span></p><p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/">http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://www.yemenwar.info/">http://www.yemenwar.info/</a> </span></p><p>Liste aller Luftangriffe / and list of all air raids:</p><p><span><a href="http://yemendataproject.org/data/">http://yemendataproject.org/data/</a></span></p><p>Untersuchung ausgewählter Luftangriffe durch Bellingcat / Bellingcat investigations of selected air raids:</p><p><span><a href="https://yemen.bellingcat.com/">https://yemen.bellingcat.com/</a></span></p><p><span>Untersuchungen von Angriffen, hunderte von Filmen / Investigations of attacks, hundreds of films:</span></p><p><span><a href="https://yemeniarchive.org/en">https://yemeniarchive.org/en</a></span></p></div>
