YAP is a part of the Global Accountability Network, working alongside the Syrian Accountability Project and the Venezuelan Accountability Project.</p><p>The Yemen Accountability Project (YAP) was founded in 2018 as a cooperative effort between legal scholars, non-governmental organizations, students, and other interested parties. The project’s members investigate and analyze open-source materials covering the Yemeni Civil War. Once the documentation is synthesized, the YAP team catalogs the information relative to applicable bodies of law, including the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Yemeni Penal Law, and other relevant treaties of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and Customary International Law (CIL). With this analytical base, YAP creates documentation products in a narrative and graphical format, as well as a trend analyses of ongoing crimes.</p><p>In September 2020, YAP published its white paper, “<span><a href="https://case.edu/law/sites/case.edu.law/files/2020-09/FINAL%20YAP%20AIDING%20ABETTING%20WHITE%20PAPER%20.pdf">Aiding and Abetting: Holding States, Corporations, and Individuals Accountable for War Crimes in Yemen</a></span>” that explores the atrocities that have led to the loss of over 100,000 lives since 2015 and offers policy proposals for accountability actions.</p><p><span><a href="https://case.edu/law/centers-institutes/cox-international-law-center/yemen-accountability-project">https://case.edu/law/centers-institutes/cox-international-law-center/yemen-accountability-project</a> </span></p><p><span>Full report:</span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Aiding &amp; Abetting: Holding states, corporations, and individuals accountable for war crimes in Yemen</strong></p><p>This report explores a prevalent question amid the ongoing strife: How can civilian victims of the war in Yemen seek justice for the grave crimes perpetrated against them? The report takes a broad perspective, pointing to instances that occurred before the violence, when the weapons and systems used to devastate the region were sold, gifted, and traded to perpetrators of the violence. This perspective implicates actors who aided and abetted the crimes against the Yemeni civilian population and provides a mode of liability for future parties seeking to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p><p>The report begins with a brief history of the conflict, moving then to a discussion on war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crucial distinction between the two. The report then outlines conduct by relevant actors in the fray, including both state and corporate actors. The report later explores avenues of accountability for bringing relevant actors to justice for aiding and abetting war crimes and crimes against humanity, and finally, puts forth proposals for policy actions that can make an impact now and in the future resolution and reckoning of this humanitarian crisis.</p><p>While external interference is not the sole driver of the violence in Yemen, repeated interventions in the Arabian Peninsula over the last century have had a debilitating effect on local nations. This has often led to the view in many Western Nations, where political realities complicate the situation, that further intervention is viewed as necessary to prevent an even greater harm. Meanwhile, defense industries continue to exert enormous influence on policy makers in all of these nations, and the lack of a cohesive foreign policy by the United States and the United Kingdom have resulted in a lack of political will to extract forces from the region.</p><p>In this geopolitical context, the Yemeni Civil War is unlikely to end in the near future, with the Arabian Peninsula unlikely to see stability as long as the war pervades. One question that remains at the forefront of the violence in Yemen is whether and how civilian victims of the violence in Yemen may seek justice for the crimes perpetrated against them. Importantly, crimes against Yemeni citizens did not begin with airstrikes or indiscriminate uses of artillery. Rather, the crimes began when weapons, guidance systems, and intelligence were sold, gifted, and traded to perpetrators of the atrocities seen in Yemen today. This wider perspective on criminality in Yemen implicates those who assisted, aided, and abetted heinous acts against Yemeni civilians. Who can be considered aiders and abettors, and how might they be held accountable? This white paper addresses this question and presents the avenues of accountability for those who have aided and abetted crimes against civilians in Yemen.</p><p><span><a href="https://case.edu/law/sites/case.edu.law/files/2020-09/FINAL%20YAP%20AIDING%20ABETTING%20WHITE%20PAPER%20.pdf">https://case.edu/law/sites/case.edu.law/files/2020-09/FINAL%20YAP%20AIDING%20ABETTING%20WHITE%20PAPER%20.pdf</a> </span></p><p><span>and the first presentation of the project in Feb. 2019: </span><span><a href="http://observer.case.edu/yemen-accountability-project-aims-to-document-war-crimes/">http://observer.case.edu/yemen-accountability-project-aims-to-document-war-crimes/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen: Aid Obstruction Puts Millions at Risk</strong></p><p>Foreign Donor Funding Critical Amid Houthi, Government Interference</p><p>The Houthi armed group and other authorities are severely restricting the delivery of desperately needed aid in <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/yemen">Yemen</a></span>, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The situation is exacerbating the country’s dire humanitarian situation and weakening its response to the <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/14/covid-19-human-rights-checklist">Covid-19</a></span> pandemic.#</p><p><span>Frau und Tochter das Haus verlassen, in deren Beisein sind Sie mit dem Fahrrad weggefahren.</span></p><p>The 65-page report, <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/node/376298">“Deadly Consequences: Obstruction of Aid in Yemen During Covid-19,”</a></span> details systematic interference in relief operations by Houthi authorities, Yemen’s internationally recognized government and affiliated forces, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)-backed Southern Transitional Council. Despite increased needs, donors slashed funding in June 2020, partly because of the obstruction, forcing aid agencies to cut food, health care, and water and sanitation support to millions of people in need. The parties to Yemen’s five-year-long armed conflict should immediately end the obstruction. Donors should increase funding to aid agencies while pressuring the local authorities to respect the humanitarian principles of independence and impartiality. The United Nations should establish an independent inquiry into the extent of obstruction and shortcomings in the humanitarian community’s response.</p><p>“Millions have been suffering in Yemen because the Houthis and other Yemeni authorities have denied the UN and other aid agencies unhindered access to people in need,” said <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/gerry-simpson">Gerry Simpson</a></span>, associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. “Yemen’s decimated healthcare sector and the unchecked spread of Covid-19 make the obstruction and recent donor aid cuts catastrophic.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch, in May and June, interviewed by phone 10 Yemeni healthcare workers, 35 aid workers from UN and international nongovernmental organizations, and 10 donor representatives about aid obstruction and the Covid-19 response in Yemen.</p><p>A decade of political and economic crisis and over five years of conflict between the Houthis and a coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia and Yemen’s internationally recognized government have crippled Yemen’s health care and other social services, triggering cholera and other disease outbreaks and widespread malnutrition. The UN calls Yemen the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with 80 percent of the country’s 30 million people needing some form of aid. While funding the aid effort, the Unites States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, and others have sold arms to the Saudi-led coalition, worsening Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.</p><p>UN agencies and nongovernmental aid organizations have continued to reach millions in need, despite obstruction by the authorities. Aid workers described the wide range of obstacles they face, including hundreds of regulations severely restricting their work, lengthy delays in approving aid projects, the blocking of aid assessments to identify people’s needs, attempts to control aid monitoring, dictating or interfering with aid recipient lists to divert aid to authority loyalists, and violence against aid staff and their property.</p><p>Since late 2019, the UN and donor countries have increasingly pressed the Houthis to help agencies do their work, which, in mid-2020, resulted in the Houthis signing a backlog of project agreements that profess non-interference with aid agencies’ independence. But aid workers question whether officials will honor the agreement or, as they have in the past, make some concessions while introducing new restrictions. Donor support to UN aid agencies collapsed in June, partly in response to the aid obstruction. As of late August, aid agencies had received only 24 percent of the US$3.4 billion they had requested for the year. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/14/yemen-aid-obstruction-puts-millions-risk">https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/14/yemen-aid-obstruction-puts-millions-risk</a></span></p><p><span>and full report: </span><span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/09/14/deadly-consequences/obstruction-aid-yemen-during-covid-19">https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/09/14/deadly-consequences/obstruction-aid-yemen-during-covid-19</a></span></p><p><span>and shorter media reports: </span><span><a href="https://apnews.com/3526b9c133f6bf37e9ad147575fda6f6">https://apnews.com/3526b9c133f6bf37e9ad147575fda6f6</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-aid/human-rights-watch-says-aid-interference-in-yemen-must-stop-idUSKBN2652I1">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-aid/human-rights-watch-says-aid-interference-in-yemen-must-stop-idUSKBN2652I1</a> </span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/yemen-aid-obstruction-will-have-deadly-consequences/a-54927776">https://www.dw.com/en/yemen-aid-obstruction-will-have-deadly-consequences/a-54927776</a> </span></p><p><span>Film: </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88n-AT8mX0M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88n-AT8mX0M</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>'Egregious record': Yemen's Houthis denounced for blocking aid</strong></p><p>And it is not just international aid organisations facing obstructions. Muna Luqman, executive director of Food4Humanity, described the Yemeni NGO's experiences with the Houthis.</p><p>"When our aid is delivered to the port in Hodeidah, we find that a portion of it will have been stolen before it leaves the port," Luqman told Al Jazeera. "There's also pressure to send aid to areas where [the Houthis] want it to go. We had a project in Hodeidah and they forced us to send it to Sanaa. We eventually found a compromise and split the aid, but the international organisations often simply agree with them."</p><p>For their part, the Houthis responded to HRW's criticisms by saying the group did not want to obstruct aid, and the allegations were coming from aid agencies that followed "political orders" from the United States.</p><p>Yemen's internationally recognised government and the United Arab Emirates-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), which was also accused of obstructing aid, did not respond.</p><p>The UN and the international community have pressured the Houthis into some concessions, with the rebel group agreeing this year to not interfere in the independence of aid organisations.</p><p>The UN has also publicly condemned Houthi restrictions, and refused to pay <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/02/houthi-rebels-impeding-aid-flow-yemen-200219062550272.html">a 2-percent tax the Houthis attempted to force on aid organisations</a></span>. The public censure risks blowback from the rebels, however, with the possibility they will clamp down on the work of international groups.</p><p>"We always want to do negotiations behind closed doors, to ensure that the best interests of the people that we serve are not at risk," Abeer Etefa, the WFP's Middle East senior spokeswoman told Al Jazeera.</p><p>"But when it's against humanitarian principles we speak out, such as what happened when we discovered the diversion of food assistance in areas under the control of the Sanaa-based authorities. There are red lines and we cannot cross these red lines."</p><p>But UN aid organisations were also criticised by HRW for shortcomings, including conceding to demands related to the control of the distribution of aid, giving money to corrupt ministries, and failing to investigate the complicity of UN bodies in aid diversion.</p><p>From her experiences working on the ground in Yemen, it is a criticism that Luqman shares.</p><p>She criticised international aid organisations for partnering with bodies affiliated with the Houthis, and said the UN had been too soft on the rebel group.</p><p>"International organisations allowed the Houthis to get away with it," Luqman said – by Abubakr Al-Shamahi</p><p><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/09/record-yemen-houthis-denounced-blocking-aid-200914160505433.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/09/record-yemen-houthis-denounced-blocking-aid-200914160505433.html</a> </span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia and America Are Responsible for the ‘Houthi Threat’ in Yemen</strong></p><p>America’s post-9/11 wars have had disastrous consequences. They have been a geopolitical bust, fragmenting rather than eliminating terrorist groups, enhancing Iran’s influence, and destabilizing the Middle East. The humanitarian consequences have been even worse: thousands of Americans killed, tens of thousands wounded, hundreds of thousands of civilians killed, millions of people displaced, al-Qaeda in Iraq and the Islamic State loosed, and entire nations ravaged.</p><p>Perhaps the most scandalous war is Yemen. </p><p>Yemen’s political pirouettes often have been dizzying, and the KSA was not threatened. The Saudis had worked with Saleh before. The Houthis, named after the founder of the movement Ansar Allah ("Supporters of God"), while a form of Shia, were independent of Iran and made their own decisions, including marching on the capital of Sanaa, against Tehran’s advice, and ousting Hadi.</p><p>However, the spoiled Saudis felt entitled to have "their" man in Sanaa and created a "coalition" with United Arab Emirates; Kuwait, unwilling to buck its powerful royal neighbor; Qatar, not yet treated as an enemy; and an amalgam of the bought and paid for, most notably Sudan, Bahrain, Morocco, Jordan, and Egypt. This assemblage then attacked the Houthi-dominated Yemeni government and expected an easy victory within weeks.</p><p>Five and a half years later the Saudi royals have learned that money cannot buy everything. The UAE has largely abandoned the war after supporting Yemeni separatists who opposed Hadi as well as the Houthis, Kuwait has sought to promote a negotiated settlement, Qatar was expelled by the Saudis and Emiratis, and post-revolutionary Sudan has withdrawn its forces. Now the war is almost entirely the Kingdom’s problem – backed, shockingly, by the U.S., which is helping the KSA slaughter Yemeni civilians.</p><p>Arguments for American involvement are risible. Yemen does not matter to the US, other than the presence of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, thought to be the most dangerous national affiliate. The Houthis are focused inward, with no interest in normal times of interdicting oil traffic or threatening Saudi Arabia. They have no desire to be pawns of Iran or otherwise surrender their independence, which they are defending against Riyadh.</p><p>The Saudi royals’ desire for a puppet regime is unsurprising: after all, the KSA expects foreigners to do all the hard work, including Americans to act as the royals’ Praetorian Guard. However, contrary to President Trump’s view – his lips appear to be permanently attached to the derriere of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – Washington has no reason to turn the Saudis into defense dependents. There certainly is no reason to let Riyadh set American Middle Eastern policy.</p><p>However, the Obama administration, apparently desperate to placate the Kingdom after striking the nuclear deal with Iran, signed onto Riyadh’s dirty war. The US provided aircraft and bombs. Serviced the planes. Provided intelligence for targeting. And initially refueled Saudi aircraft as well. Alas, it turns out that the Saudis pilots were good at little more than bombing weddings, funerals, school buses, apartments, and other civilian targets, killing thousands of Yemenis.</p><p>Perhaps the most ironic impact of the coalition’s aggressive war was to make the Houthis dependent on Iran.</p><p>Although the Houthis became the only viable option for Tehran, the movement has retained its independence. Explained Rand: "The Houthis are not solely dependent on Iranian support, having created their own sources of revenue by taxing shipments through the Yemeni city of Al-Hudaydah’s port, rent extraction, and smuggling activities. These independent revenue streams provide the Houthis with some degree of leverage or at least autonomy when accepting Iranian offers of support. More important, the interests and goals of Houthi and Iranian leadership do not necessarily align on all issues.</p><p>If there is one common lesson to learn from the last two decades worth of endless wars it is the law of unintended consequences. Virtually nothing has worked out as it was supposed to. In the case of Yemen, Riyadh’s brutal aggression to prevent the Iranian-backed Houthis from dominating Yemen may end up cementing a close Iranian-Houthi alliance that dominates Yemen. That is yet another reason for America to end its shameful participation in Riyadh’s murderous war against its impoverished neighbor – by Doug Bandow</p><p><span><a href="https://original.antiwar.com/doug-bandow/2020/09/13/saudi-arabia-and-america-are-responsible-for-the-houthi-threat-in-yemen/">https://original.antiwar.com/doug-bandow/2020/09/13/saudi-arabia-and-america-are-responsible-for-the-houthi-threat-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen’s Old City of Sana’a: Stripped of Its Identity</strong></p><p>While the devastating human and economic costs of crises plaguing countries such as Lebanon and Yemen are highly visible, there’s another cost that hits at the heart of their people—the loss of identity. Just as the August explosion in Beirut has further chipped away at the old city’s quarters, the unprecedented floods in Sana’a have brought breathtaking, ancient towers to their knees. And for many Yemenis, this symbolizes yet another attack on their national identity. Old Sana’a has been a significant historical icon for generations.</p><p>For Sananis, the old city’s architecture is part of their identity and familial history. But, over the last decade, much of this history has been lost, and what remains is gradually slipping away. In July 2015, <span><a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1310">UNESCO added</a></span> the historic city to the list of world heritage sites in danger. Damage caused by the floods last month is just the latest and most visible evidence of this. It symbolizes and adds injury to years of destruction from forces of conflict, abandonment, and neglect.</p><p>The heavy rains hit Old Sana’a particularly hard because of the already miserable posture of the war-torn city. According to <span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-floods-sanaa-old-city/yemens-unesco-listed-old-sanaa-houses-collapse-in-heavy-rains-idUSKCN2560MK">initial UNESCO reporting</a></span>, torrents besieged 111 houses either entirely or partially.

We have seen several UNESCO-listed houses among the damaged places,” said Mohammed al-Hakimi, an environment journalist and editor of Holm Akhdar website.</p><p>Yet even before the current conflict began, successive governments were turning a blind eye to the plight in front of them. According to locals, no building maintenance has been done since 2004, when Sana’a was announced as the <span><a href="https://www.saba.ye/en/news48553.htm">Capital of Arabic Culture</a></span>.</p><p>When the Houthis took over Sana’a in September 2014, the situation only got worse—indifference turned into desecration. The Houthis began coating many of the ancient buildings with propaganda slogans and chants.</p><p>Moreover, the sprawl of modern-style construction began to invade the old city. “Many inhabitants sell their homes to market merchants who reconstruct them or turn them into commercial centers—dealing with them as normal properties, not ancient buildings needing to be taken care of. We have seen new markets emerge, new premises built, while white-brown buildings disappear,” said Mohammed, a merchant who had worked in the city’s old market for more than twenty years.</p><p>Without the needed assistance to maintain their homes and buildings, many struggling Sanani inhabitants have been pushed to abandon or sell their houses and close their businesses.</p><p>Many Sananis see the floods as the death knell for an old city already in danger of disappearing. The rains just revealed the reality.</p><p>Yemen’s increasingly severe rainy season—likely an effect of climate change—is playing a significant role, but what underlies the catastrophic situation is man-made.

These form what could be called the government’s triangle of power, drawn between the cities of Marib, Ataq and Sayoun in the governorates of Marib, Shabwa and Hadramawt, respectively, which account for all of Yemen’s oil and natural gas production. Control of Yemen’s oil and gas fields represents an immense strategic resource, both for their current revenues and future potential as hydrocarbon exports continue to recover. </p><p>Marib, Shabwa and Hadramawt, while rich in natural resources are also relatively sparsely populated, while the inverse dynamic is at play in areas held by the Yemeni government’s main rivals in the ongoing conflict: The armed Houthi movement and the Southern Transitional Council (STC) control the country’s most densely populated areas, which are also relatively devoid of easily exploitable natural resources. It should come as no surprise, then, the government has found its grip on these areas increasingly challenged by its rivals. </p><p>Should Marib city fall into the hands of the Houthis it would also put government-held Shabwa governorate and its oil fields in Bayhan and Uqlah under serious threat. This is why government brigades based in Shabwa, namely the Bayhan military axis, have been heavily involved in the battles to the west in Qaniah and Al-Abdiah fronts along the border between Marib and Houthi-held Al-Bayda governorate.</p><p>Shabwa also came under threat from the STC following the breakdown in relations between the separatist group and the Yemeni government.</p><p>The Houthis and the STC have multiple motivations for wanting a piece of the government’s triangle of power. Among their chief concerns is that both groups control heavily populated regions of Yemen that lack substantial local revenue bases to support them.</p><p>Even after being expelled from its interim capital, Aden, the Yemeni government was still a player on the ground due to its control of the Marib-Ataq-Sayoun triangle. The government and its Saudi supporters are aware that losing any corner of this triangle would risk stripping Yemen’s ‘legitimate’ government of meaningful significance in the country, and they have thus fought with renewed fervor to hold these positions.</p><p><span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/11542">https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/11542</a></span></p><p><span>and main points </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/SanaaCenter/status/1303997541672005632">https://twitter.com/SanaaCenter/status/1303997541672005632</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Hört den Frauen einfach zu</strong></p><p><span>Den Feminismus im Jemen an westlichen Standards zu messen, ergibt keinen Sinn. In einem Land, in dem es keine Menschenrechte gibt, kann es auch keine Frauenrechte geben.</span></p><p>Es gibt einen Text über das <span><a href="https://www.persee.fr/doc/remmm_0997-1327_1991_num_59_1_2689_t1_0280_0000_2"><em>Leben der Frauen im Jemen</em></a> von Claudia Fayein, einer französischen Ärztin, die 1951/52 im Jemen arbeitete und nach der Revolution und der Absetzung des Königs 1962 das Land mehr als zwei Dutzend Male bereiste. Die sozialistisch-republikanische Revolution sprengte die finstere Isolation, in der das jemenitische Volk bis dahin gelebt hatte. Claudia Fayein beschreibt die zahlreichen Neuerungen im täglichen Leben, gerade für Mädchen und Frauen.</span></p><p>Zudem beschränkte sich der Wandel auf die Städte und erreichte nicht die Dörfer, in denen die Mehrheit der Bevölkerung lebte. Fayeins Buch erschien 1990 und behandelte drei verschiedene historische Phasen, zwischen 1965 und 1989. Man sollte annehmen, dass sich in all den Jahrzehnten das patriarchalische Denken und die Mentalität der Frauen, sich als weniger wert zu betrachten, allmählich verflüchtigt hätten. Aber leider ist dem nicht so. Während Hunderttausende von Jemenitinnen ihre Ausbildung vorantrieben und studierten, sowohl im Land als auch außerhalb des Landes, und der <span><a href="https://www.zeit.de/thema/feminismus">Feminismus</a> inzwischen fast jede Frau mit Internetanschluss erreicht, hat sich das Bewusstsein der Frauen im Hinblick auf ihren Wert und auf ihre Verantwortung in der Gesellschaft fast nicht verändert.</span></p><p>Die soziale und ökonomische Transformation konnte nicht in eine psychologische und mentale Transformation überführt werden.</p><p>Es gibt zahllose Missverständnisse über den arabischen Feminismus im Allgemeinen und den jemenitischen Feminismus speziell.</p><p>Wir haben feministische Bewegungen im Jemen, aber es fehlt ihnen eine soziale Basis. Sie beruhen auf persönlichen Leistungen einzelner, auf individuellen Anstrengungen, und oft sind sie voller Hass und Ressentiment gegen die jemenitische Gesellschaft. Die jemenitische Gesellschaft wird als illiterat, dumm und zurückgeblieben verdammt. Die Feministinnen versuchen, bei den Frauen ein Bewusstsein für ihre Probleme zu wecken, und zwingen ihnen eine Ideologie auf. Aber keine versucht, mit den Frauen über ihre Verantwortlichkeiten in ein Gespräch zu kommen, keine gibt den Frauen den Raum, um sich zu öffnen und sich auszutauschen über die patriarchalische Mentalität, wie sie von ihr betroffen sind, und wie sie ihren eigenen Wert und ihr Recht auf Gleichbehandlung und Emanzipation anerkennen könnten. Insbesondere in den sozialen Medien beschränkt sich der Feminismus darauf, die Männer zu verurteilen, ja sie zu beschimpfen und ihnen die Schuld an allem zu geben.</p><p>Ich bin Feministin, und ich denke, dass das Patriarchat eine Realität ist. Aber ich glaube nicht, dass die Männer unsere Feinde sind, und ich halte weder die vorherrschenden feministischen Bewegungen im Jemen noch die Diskussionen in Europa über arabischen Feminismus für zielführend.</p><p>Zunächst einmal ist das Problem im Jemen im Kern immer noch ein humanitäres Problem. Wir haben keine <span><a href="https://www.zeit.de/thema/menschenrechte">Menschenrechte</a>, und ohne Menschenrechte gibt es auch keine Frauenrechte. Die Frauen sind dabei, die Hoffnung zu verlieren, sie leben in ständiger Furcht, sie sorgen sich um ihre Familien, sie kämpfen um das tägliche Brot. Das alles zu ignorieren und die Frauen immer nur daran zu erinnern, wie schlimm ihr Leben ist und wie sehr sie sich unterworfen haben, wird keinerlei Änderung bringen, im Gegenteil.</span></p><p>Weiterhin gibt es keine Solidarität, keine Kollektivität in diesen feministischen Strömungen. Sie klammern sich an ihre Vorstellungen vom westlichen Feminismus und verschließen ihre Augen vor den Gegebenheiten im Jemen.</p><p>Ich selbst brauchte zwei Jahre des Ingenieurstudiums, um mir über den Feminismus und über meine Rolle als Frau klar zu werden. Ich wollte Ingenieurin werden, weil ich daran glaubte, dass ich auf diese Weise allen Frauen dieser Welt zeigen würde, dass wir das sein können, was Männer sein können. Darüber vergaß ich, was ich eigentlich selbst wollte.</p><p>Wir brauchen Vorbilder, im Mittleren Osten und besonders im Jemen, die den Frauen die Kraft geben, die patriarchalische Mentalität zu überwinden, die ihnen zeigen, dass es möglich ist zu überleben, und dass es auch möglich ist, in Frieden mit sich und den anderen zu sein – von Altaf Merzah</p><p><span><a href="https://www.zeit.de/kultur/2020-09/jemen-frauenrechte-feminismus-patriarchat-mittlerer-osten/komplettansicht">https://www.zeit.de/kultur/2020-09/jemen-frauenrechte-feminismus-patriarchat-mittlerer-osten/komplettansicht</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>New UN report offers grim reminder of US complicity in the brutal war in Yemen</strong></p><p>If you want a graphic example of how U.S. intervention can very often make the situation worse, look no further the civil war in Yemen</p><p>While the United States may not be bombing Houthi targets alongside Saudi and Emirati warplanes, the fact is that Washington’s diplomatic, intelligence, and military support to the Saudi-led coalition since the war began has made it a party to the conflict. As the U.N. Expert Group on Yemen concluded in <span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/GEE-Yemen/2020-09-09-report.pdf">its latest report</a></span> this week, “third States, including Canada, France, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the United Kingdom…and the United States of America, continued their support of parties to the conflict including through arms transfers, thereby helping to perpetuate the conflict.”</p><p>Whether U.S. officials care to admit it or not, Washington is the most significant enabler of Saudi Arabia’s biggest foreign policy disaster in decades — helping to sustain an indiscriminate, bloody, and ineffective military campaign that has produced nothing but tens of thousands of civilian deaths, massive displacement, a catalogue of war crimes (one case more heinous than the next), starvation, and a further degradation of Yemen’s already poor public infrastructure.</p><p>Why the United States would want to be associated with any of this is beyond any rational explanation. Yet the natural question — why on earth is the U.S. still involved in one of the region’s most intractable internal conflicts — has still not been sufficiently answered. U.S. policy in Yemen is a twisted mess of contradictions, with the U.S. State Department <span><a href="https://www.state.gov/assistant-secretary-of-state-schenker-leads-u-s-delegation-to-high-level-virtual-pledging-conference-for-humanitarian-crisis-in-yemen/">encouraging</a></span> a negotiated political solution to the war at the very same time it pushes billions of dollars in defense equipment</p><p>the truth is that U.S. policy on both Saudi Arabia and Yemen is not just on Trump‘s shoulders. It’s a bipartisan failure spanning two presidencies. It was President Barack Obama, not Donald Trump, who agreed to plunge the United States into Yemen’s civil war to begin with.</p><p>The U.S. is presented with two, clear options in Yemen. The first is a continuation of the status-quo, where Washington pays lip service to diplomacy while taking actions that fuel the war and make a potential diplomatic solution even less palpable to the combatants. If Washington takes this road, it should expect the same results: more civilian casualties, a deeper deterioration of Yemen’s overall humanitarian situation, a more emboldened Saudi and UAE coalition that takes U.S. support for granted, and a proliferation of the very terrorist groups the U.S. seeks to combat.</p><p>Or, alternatively, Washington can cut the cord on this conflict and truly support a U.N. peace process that is, at best, suffering from all kinds of logistical and substantive problems. Choosing this course would not only distance the U.S. from a war it has no direct national security interest in participating in, but would also send a much-needed message to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and any other security partner in the Middle East that Washington will no longer spend precious resources and moral capital on disputes only the region can resolve – by Dan DePetris</p><p><span><a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2020/09/11/new-un-report-us-complicity-brutal-war-in-yemen/">https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2020/09/11/new-un-report-us-complicity-brutal-war-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Revealed: Censored videos show Saudi pilots bombing Britain</strong></p><p>The UK’s Royal Air Force is refusing to release video footage that shows fighter pilots from Saudi Arabia conducting air attacks in Britain, as part of a controversial military training scheme which involves 25 civilian airports.</p><p>Saudi air force pilots are being allowed to conduct “air-to-ground training sorties” in Britain, Declassified has found. </p><p>Video recordings of the bombing sorties are being withheld by the RAF, which refuses to release the footage in case it upsets diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. </p><p>An oil-rich dictatorship, Saudi Arabia is one of the UK’s closest military allies.

Often a flashpoint for tensions between Iran and the United States, Yemen and the Saudi Coalition, and a major chokepoint for much of the world’s maritime transit, the waters surrounding Yemen, particularly the island of Socotra, have become a much-vaunted prize for regional intelligence and security apparatus. Now, both the UAE and Israel are working to establish military and intelligence centers on Socotra, which lays some 240 kilometers east of the coast of Somalia and 380 kilometers south of the Arabian Peninsula.</p><p>According to one Yemeni source, the United Arab Emirates and Israel have already completed logistical operations to establish intelligence-gathering bases and new military facilities on the island. A presence on Socotra will not only allow the new alliance to establish a foothold against Yemen’s Houthi-led opposition, but will allow it to conduct surveillance on Oman, Iran, Pakistan, and China, who, in recent years, has established a presence on the nearby horn of Africa.</p><p>Last week, an Emirati ship arrived on Socotra laden with personnel from the UAE and Israel and transporting weapons and communication equipment according to a local source on the island. Even before the UAE-Israel normalization deal was announced, the two countries were sending delegations to Perim Island, known as Mayyun in Arabic, a volcanic island in the Strait of Mandeb at the south entrance to the Red Sea.</p><p>In Socotra, locals report that the same Emirati-Israeli team arrived on an Emirati aircraft various times throughout the year to examine locations in the Momi district on the east of the island and the Qatnan locality on its western coast.</p><p>Issa Salem Bin Yaqoot al-Soctari, the head of indigenous tribes on the island, <span><a href="http://www.adennewsagencey.com/57006/">said in a statement </a></span>recently that the UAE has brought Israel to Socotra and that both sides have already started building new bases there. With much consternation, al-Soctari complained of the UAE’s “policy of repression, starvation, and intimidation” against the island’s residents. Mirroring Israel’s policy in Palestine, al-Soctrai also accused Emirati forces of intentionally changing the Island’s demographics by housing foreigners on the island en masse.</p><p>Israel has few friends in Yemen</p><p>Israel is far from a welcome presence in Yemen and local support for the Palestinian cause is nearly universal. Large demonstrations have already taken place in Abyan, Taiz, and Shabwah against the normalization of ties with Israel and against any Israeli presence in Yemen.</p><p>Officials in Yemen’s easternmost province of al-Mahrah told <em>MintPress </em>that the security cooperation between UAE and Israel is being actively supported by Saudi Arabia and aims to help the Saudi-led coalition carry out its <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/al-mahrah-yemen-tribes-renew-armed-struggle-against-saudi-forces/265352/">long-held goal</a> of tightening control over the province by gathering intelligence on the ground. Intelligence gathering operations on Socotra would also cast neighboring Oman under UAE and Israeli radars.</p><p>Socotra has been a prize for the UAE, and indeed for Israel, for years.

Over the past week, 51 new confirmed cases, 16 deaths and 80 recoveries were reported. The highest number of confirmed cases continue to be reported in Hadramaut (926 cases, 299 deaths and 503 recoveries), though this may in part reflect the number of tests conducted in the governorate. Although the number of cases reported has declined, indicators suggest that the virus continues to spread and the number of confirmed cases and deaths fall below actual numbers. A lack of testing facilities and official reporting, and people delaying seeking treatment because of stigma, difficulty accessing treatment centres and the perceived risks of seeking care are some of the reasons behind the perceived decline in case numbers. The COVID-19 response continues to focus on testing, surveillance and case management, while procuring oxygen, personal protective equipment (PPE), and monitors are a priority.</p><p><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-covid-19-preparedness-and-response-snapshot-12-september-2020">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-covid-19-preparedness-and-response-snapshot-12-september-2020</a></p><p>(* B H)</p><p>Film: Covid in Yemen: The city where all the doctors fled - except one - BBC News</p><p>During the height of the pandemic in Yemen, there was only one functioning hospital in the city of Aden, which is home to more than a million people.

Each outbreak has paralysed children in areas that have been extremely difficult if not impossible to reach with routine or supplementary polio vaccination for extended periods of time.<br />“These outbreaks do not come as a total surprise. In Sudan, extensive population movement by nomadic communities, people displaced by conflict, frequent movement between neighbouring countries and restricted access in some areas have made it enormously difficult to reach every child with vaccines. The cases in Yemen are clustered in the Sa’adah Governorate in the war-ravaged country’s north-west, an area that has very low routine immunization levels and has been inaccessible to the polio programme for more than two years. The last house-to-house campaigns in this area were in November 2018.<br />“Polio is a devastatingly contagious disease, transmitted from person to person through close contact. The only way to stop it is through vaccination using oral polio vaccine. Vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks are a siren call that immunity levels in affected communities have become unacceptably low.<br />“For WHO, UNICEF, governments, and partners across these two countries, outbreaks like these threaten to undo decades of progress achieved by the polio programme.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/polio-programme-accelerates-efforts-respond-new-polio-outbreaks-sudan-and-yemen">https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/polio-programme-accelerates-efforts-respond-new-polio-outbreaks-sudan-and-yemen</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp2 Allgemein / General</span></h2><p><span>(* A K P)</span></p><p><span>Interactive Map of Yemen War</span></p><p><span><a href="https://yemen.liveuamap.com/">https://yemen.liveuamap.com/</a></span></p><p><span>(* A K)</span></p><p>MILITARY SITUATION IN YEMEN ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2020 (MAP UPDATE)</p><p><a href="https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-september-14-2020-map-update/">https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-september-14-2020-map-update/</a> </p><p>MILITARY SITUATION IN YEMEN ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2020 (MAP UPDATE)</p><p><span><a href="https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-september-13-2020-map-update/">https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-september-13-2020-map-update/</a></span></p><p>Latest Updates on Yemen, 13 September 2020</p><p><span><a href="https://english.iswnews.com/15229/latest-updates-on-yemen-13-september-2020/">https://english.iswnews.com/15229/latest-updates-on-yemen-13-september-2020/</a></span></p><p>MILITARY SITUATION IN YEMEN ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2020 (MAP UPDATE)</p><p><span><a href="https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-september-12-2020-map-update/">https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-september-12-2020-map-update/</a></span></p><p>SAUDI-BACKED FORCES SUFFER ANOTHER SETBACK IN YEMEN’S MARIB PROVINCE (MAP UPDATE)</p><p><span><a href="https://southfront.org/saudi-backed-forces-suffer-another-setback-in-yemens-marib-province-map-update/">https://southfront.org/saudi-backed-forces-suffer-another-setback-in-yemens-marib-province-map-update/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>There are dangerous repercussions for Yemen from UAE-Israel normalisation</p><p>Gulf normalisation with Israel is picking up pace due to the tremendous electoral pressure imposed by US President Donald Trump on the states which are existentially linked to America for their security. Another common denominator that unites all of the normalisers is their participation in a military coalition fighting in Yemen that still claims to be there in order to protect the legitimate government-in-exile and allow it to return to the country.</p><p>Five years since the coalition’s intervention, it seems that Yemen is facing more serious challenges than before. Rival local parties now face the entry of another regional player that is intended to provide the coalition with protection from accountability as it continues to target Yemen and its sovereignty. The coalition wants to impose the option of splitting Yemen up by attracting Israel to areas where the security, strategic and vital interests of most regional countries meet.</p><p>The first wave brought on by the normalisation agreement between Israel and the UAE hit the beaches of the Socotra Archipelago. The islands were almost closed by military influence and multinational intelligence activity under the Saudi and UAE umbrella, most of which was carried out by Israel.</p><p>All the people in Socotra are aware that the enemy is now located in their country, and its experts move about freely under that Arab umbrella. They are redirecting the archipelago’s function from being a vital part of Yemen to being a stab in the back of Arab national security. This hurts the dignity of Socotra’s people, who are Yemenis through and through, with an established affiliation of Yemeni Arab Muslim identity.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200914-there-are-dangerous-repercussions-for-yemen-from-uae-israel-normalisation/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200914-there-are-dangerous-repercussions-for-yemen-from-uae-israel-normalisation/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H K P)</span></p><p>Joint INGO Statement on Yemen – 75th session of the UN General Assembly</p><p>We are now sleepwalking towards a seventh year of war, and the people of Yemen can only surmise that the world has forgotten them. The UN Secretary General called in March for a global ceasefire tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, but in Yemen this call has not translated into reality on the ground, at the expense of the lives and livelihoods of ordinary civilians.</p><p>Two-thirds of the population – 20 million people – are hungry, and nearly 1.5 million families currently rely entirely on food aid to survive. Ongoing restrictions by warring parties in a country that imports 90% of its food, coupled with a currency crisis, has led to food shortages and price increases. The global COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation; the resulting economic slump across the world has led to a dramatic drop in remittances sent back by Yemeni diaspora, a major source of income for the country. The latest data shows that another million people are set to fall into crisis levels of hunger before the year end. Women and children are the worst affected, with 1.4 million pregnant or breastfeeding women and over two million children suffering from malnutrition.<br />Yemen’s conflict remains the main driver of food insecurity, ruining the economy and driving farmers from their land. As recalled in UN Security Council Resolution 2417, international humanitarian law requires that warring parties meet the basic needs of the civilian population – including food.</p><p>Ongoing fighting continues to take a devastating toll on civilians. Airstrikes, shelling and ground fighting continue, with 10 new frontlines having emerged since the beginning of 2020. In July and August 2020 alone at least 33 civilians were killed in airstrikes – including 21 children. Intense fighting, particularly in Marib and Abyan governorates, jeopardises civilian lives, causing mass displacement and depriving people of access to essential services. Civilian infrastructure continues to be hit by all parties with impunity, and medical and water infrastructure – essential for an effective response to COVID-19 – have been hit during air raids almost 200 times since the conflict escalated in March 2015, equivalent to once every 10 days. Despite widespread violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, committed by all parties to the conflict, those responsible are not being held to account.</p><p>Yemen is now a drastically under-funded crisis. </p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/joint-ingo-statement-yemen-75th-session-un-general-assembly">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/joint-ingo-statement-yemen-75th-session-un-general-assembly</a></span></p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p>Saudi-Emirati military talks to support Yemeni gov't forces</p><p>The Saudi-Emirati military coalition revives coordination one year after Abu Dhabi withdraw its troops from the Yemeni southern port city of Aden.</p><p>The new commander of Saudi-led coalition joint forces (JF) in Yemen, Gen Motlaq al-Ozaimi'e, on Saturday met with the Emirati land troops commander, Gen Saleh al-Aamiri, and held talks on military operations in support of the Yemeni national army, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said.</p><p>The meeting also addressed the efforts jointly exerted as part of the coalition ongoing operations to support Yemen's legitimacy, SPA added.</p><p><span><a href="https://debriefer.net/en/news-19831.html">https://debriefer.net/en/news-19831.html</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Beyond Yemen's Militiadoms. Restarting from local agency</p><p>This Conflict Series Brief analyses the intertwined layers of conflict in Yemen and their implications for war resolution efforts. The local-foreign nexus between Yemeni and external actors needs to be disentangled to separate domestic drivers and the regional and/or sectarian dimensions of the conflict. Competing ‘militiadoms’ are on the rise, thus transforming the traditional Yemeni pattern of hybrid security governance into a multiple security governance scenario. The Brief examines the Yemeni crisis in all its complexity, focusing on existing and emerging dynamics. Interference by foreign state powers is both a cause and a consequence of the protracted conflict, while the potential for peace must be sought at local level.

It also allows UNHCR to inform displaced communities and individuals about how to access services. It supports communities to strengthen pre-existing capacity and their own resilience to shock, such as conflict, natural disaster or epidemy, notably COVID-19. Listening and talking to the communities it serves is inherent in UNHCR humanitarian response and an integral to UNHCR community-based protection approach.</p><p>In Yemen, community engagement has been an essential part of UNHCR's response to the crisis. UNHCR and its partners engage and communicate with communities using both physical and virtual modalities, including face to face meetings, posters, leaflets, hotlines, text messages, and social media. It is essential for emergency responders to understand different groups and individuals' information needs, their preferred channels, and trusted sources. Any engagement with communities must also take into consideration socio-cultural norms and traditional practices that may impact specifics groups' – such as women, children, elderly persons, and persons with disabilities – access to information and opportunities to impart information to other members of the community or humanitarian partners.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/understanding-how-unhcr-engages-communities-yemen-community-engagement-survey-report">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/understanding-how-unhcr-engages-communities-yemen-community-engagement-survey-report</a> </span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>SFD Yemen: </span><span>Starting a new project for 81 villages, 27 teams from @Ruawfd help form 81 Village Cooperative Councils </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VCCs?src=hashtag_click">#VCCs</a></span><span> and prepare needs and initiative plans for each village in Shahara </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Amran?src=hashtag_click">#Amran</a></span><span>. </span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/tamkeen">@Tamkeen</a></span><span> allocates finance to fund 50% of the largest infrastructure initiatives</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/SFDYemen/status/1305085207716835328">https://twitter.com/SFDYemen/status/1305085207716835328</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span>Lost youth: Yemeni children open Smurfs car wash to help their father</span></p><p>Three brothers, the youngest just seven, know little of normal life for their age and are focused on earning money to survive</p><p>It is a Friday afternoon and three young brothers are washing cars outside. </p><p>For these skinny children, there is no school and there are no holidays. They started this business four months ago, and they work here washing cars every day from 8am until 6pm.</p><p>The boys are organised into a team: one washes the car, another wipes it and the youngest sweeps it.

Instead, they've got their minds set on a larger carwash centre.</p><p>"If we stop work, there is no one to help us, so we have to work to help my father," said Mohammed.</p><p>"I hope to have a big carwash service in the future, and this one can be the beginning."</p><p>Working for 12 hours washing cars is hard work even for adults, it is even harder for children, toiling under the harsh sun, so sometimes the brothers hire other children to help them.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-children-car-wash-business-lost-childhoods-help-father">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-children-car-wash-business-lost-childhoods-help-father</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project Fifth Additional Financing (P172662) - Social Impact Assessment (SIA) For Component 3 (Emergency Cash Transfer) August 24, 2020</p><p>The intensification of the crisis in Yemen since 2015 led to the suspension of the Social Welfare Fund (SWF), leaving the already vulnerable SWF beneficiaries without any social protection support.

As of 31 July, UNICEF received $29 million against $103 million of funding requirements. Despite the funding gaps and operational constraints, UNICEF continues to implement its responses using alternative modalities. The Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) reached 524,340 million people with COVID-19 messages while keeping physical distancing.

In recent months, following the Houthi occupation of the capital city of Sana‘a inSeptember 2014, the group has expanded their area of control into the south of Yemen. The Houthis have solidified their position in power by forming a coalition government with other Yemeni tri</span><span>bal and political groups. They are gaining control over more </span><span>territory as the </span><span>most powerful political force in Yemen. Since the initial conflict between </span><span>the Houthis and the government of Yemen began in earnest in 2004, the Houthis have transitioned from a peaceful social movement to a violent anti-government movement, to a movement holding national political power and seeking to create a coalition government in Yemen (Dumm 2). With the flight </span><span>of Yemeni President Hadi from the</span><span>capital Sana‘a and the recent campaign of Saudi anti-Houthi airstrikes with the stated aim of restoring Hadi to power, an understanding of the Houthi Islamic social movement is more important than ever. An examination of the Houthis as </span><span>an Islamic social movement</span><span> provides a framework that can be used to effectively explore the identity, beliefs, and background of the group. Applying social movement theory literature and historical analysis gives one the opportunity to examine the roots of the Houthi movement and the historical factors t</span><span>hat led to the group‘s creation and popularity. This approach also </span><span>offers perspective on the probable direction of a Houthi led Yemeni government in the future</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/19690034/The_Rise_of_the_Houthi">https://www.academia.edu/19690034/The_Rise_of_the_Houthi</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>The Huthi Enigma: Ansar Allah and the “Second Republic” [2018]</p><p>The question of the changes prompted by the Arab Spring upheavals in the northernmost regions of Yemen – the Saʿda province and its adjacent areas – can be easily answered: The republican order, as it evolved during the 34-year reign of former President Ali Abd Allah Salih, no longer exists. The changes in the structures and the socio-political composition of power in Yemen’s North are of such breadth that a reintroduction of the regime-periphery relations of the republican period seems impossible. In Yemen’s North thetransformation process triggered by the Arab Spring thus reinforced the continuation of the changes in regime-periphery relationswhich originally had been set in motion by the onset of the SaʿdaWars in 2004 (Salmoni, Loidolt and Wells 2010) – by Marieke Brandt</p><p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/28717477/The_Huthi_Enigma_Ansar_Allah_and_the_Second_Republic_2018_">https://www.academia.edu/28717477/The_Huthi_Enigma_Ansar_Allah_and_the_Second_Republic_2018_</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p><span>[from 2018] </span>Drivers of the Ḥouthī Conflict in Yemen (UWTSD, 2018)</p><p>The Ḥouthī conflict is one with many facets, ranging from tensions around Yemen’s resources, religious and military disputes to political quarrels between elites and the populations, all in the framework of tribal and more contemporary social networks.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/36705624/Drivers_of_the_%E1%B8%A4outh%C4%AB_Conflict_in_Yemen_UWTSD_2018_">https://www.academia.edu/36705624/Drivers_of_the_%E1%B8%A4outh%C4%AB_Conflict_in_Yemen_UWTSD_2018_</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p><span>[from 2018] </span>“Screaming in the Face of the Arrogant”: Understanding the Logic and Symbolism of Yemen’s Huthi Movement</p><p>Commonly described by Western media as a Shi’i Zaydi revivalist movement, a rebel group and an Iranian proxy, the Huthis (or Ansar Allah) exist marginally in the Western consciousness. The little knowledge that is recycled about the movement is typically misleading, and conducive to stereotypes and an underestimation of the group’s military and strategic capabilities. The reality of today’s Ansar Allah is both a skilled paramilitary force that has internalized the lessons of a decade and a half of war, as well as a political organization with the veneer of a social justice movement, which excels in the production of propaganda on the local and regional stages. The Huthis may, in fact, be the band of slogan-chanting tribesmen occasionally seen on major news networks, but they are also a remarkably resilient and dynamic entity that adapts to Yemen’s ever-changing political landscape – by Hannah Porter</p><p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/38151253/_Screaming_in_the_Face_of_the_Arrogant_Understanding_the_Logic_and_Symbolism_of_Yemen_s_Huthi_Movement">https://www.academia.edu/38151253/_Screaming_in_the_Face_of_the_Arrogant_Understanding_the_Logic_and_Symbolism_of_Yemen_s_Huthi_Movement</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p><span>[from 2018] </span>Shifting patterns of identity among the Zaydi community in Yemen: a political question?</p><p>“I’m Zaydi, no problem. But when you come and tell me, ‘You are a polytheist (mušrik) an innovator in religion (mubtadiʾ), and your forefather went astray (aid l-dalāl),’ I will automatically question who I am and begin returning to my roots. This was one of the most important reasons that brought Zaydism back to life.” ----- I will start with an introduction of the history of the Zaydi faith and its fundamental theological doctrines, continue with an outline of the 1000 years Imamate until the coup in 1962 and subsequent civil war, before analysing the trail to the 1990 unification of North and South Yemen which provided new space for political activism that was cannily exploited by Zaydi activists. Then I will shed light on the Saʿdah wars (2004-2010) through which the Zaydi revival managed to develop a powerful social revolutionary and political component and solidified the Houthi movement. The concluding chapter will deal with the ‘fall’ of President Saleh in 2011 and the Zaydi revivalism which gained momentum thereafter, shedding light on the 2012 declaration by senior Zaydi scholars voicing preference for the Imamate as preferred political identity.

Framing the Huthi movement in the Yemeni Zaydi Shia tradition, this contribution explores the evolution of the Huthis as a political movement and militia, from the Saada wars (2004-10) to the civil conflict started in 2015. Viewing the Huthis as political actors within Yemen’s multiple geographies, it contends that the northern insurgents have been able to capitalize on internal and external dynamics, embodying a form of populist elitism. Pursuing the autonomy of the northern highlands, the Huthis have formally and informally penetrated the state they used to contest, transforming from local insurgents into, paradoxically, national contenders in a fractured and polycentric Yemen, despite their persistent local identity and goals – by Eleonora Ardemagni</p><p><span><a

          Yuval Harari ist einer der erfolgreichsten Sachbuchautoren der Welt. Von der „Kurzen Geschichte der Menschheit“ wurden in Deutschland über eine Millionen Exemplare verkauft. Nun erscheint der Weltbestseller als Graphic Novel: Harari noch zugänglicher und unterhaltsamer, aber genauso intelligent und lehrreich - ein Muss nicht nur für seine Fans.
