It is a sobering reminder of how uncivilized the world can become if the right unfortunate elements combine. If you share this belief, it will come as little surprise that Yemen’s war has rumbled on for three years without really turning heads. A war that has cost thousands of lives, destroyed homes, hospitals, even schools while making others a fortune. Like many before it, Yemen’s war has been fueled by a lucrative arms industry, particularly dominated by familiar faces.</p> <p>The arms and military equipment bought from the US and UK are being put to use in Yemen. The Saudi led coalition continues to viciously fight the Houthis within Yemen, predominantly through airstrikes. Their fighting has been inefficient, to say the least. In fact, it appears almost indiscriminate; millions of civilians have been affected by their bombing and artillery fire, either being directly injured or killed by attacks, or displaced because of the damage, especially in the northern provinces where fighting is most fierce. Some blame the Saudis for unnecessarily escalating the situation to serve their own agenda within the region; containing Iranian expansion. But the blame for this war falls at the feet of many, not just a few.</p> <p>This is another story of people trying to survive in an environment that is crumbling around them. After nearly four years of violence, the country is reaching a point of no return, and it is still unclear if any tangible steps have been taken to bring the conflict to an end. One thing, however, is clear; Yemen cannot afford it to continue.</p> <p>The official, cliché line we’ve heard from ambassadors, diplomats, governors, ministers, and presidents is ‘the situation is very bad and it needs to stop’, some might even condemn the war and its actors. Unfortunately, in most cases these words are hollow considering how both Britain and the United States have refused to stop the arms and military equipment sales to Saudi Arabia, deeming them too lucrative to abandon. Therefore, both nations are responsible for literally fuelling and loading the planes that have caused much of the destruction in during the coalition offenses.</p> <p>But for now at least both the US and UK are still supporting the coalition, and in this case, actions speak much louder than words.</p> <p>In this bizarre political storm, it falls to people like Fatik al-Rodanini and the countless other aid workers to proactively hold the country from complete catastrophe. Their work is at times unimaginable, but continuously vital for those suffering in Yemen.</p> <p>After briefly mentioning the future of his country, Fatik was quick to tell me how ready people are to stay, rebuild, and move on once it is made safe enough to do so.</p> <p>‘People don’t want to leave their country, they love their country. When the fighting stops, we will rebuild our country.’</p> <p>With the number of conflicting participants involved in this war, that hopeful future might be hard to imagine. Quite simply there are too many dollars on the line for the US to haul the sale of arms to the Saudi’s, even if they’re being used recklessly.</p> <p>Research fellow at New America specializing in Arab and Islamic affairs, <span><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/archive?query=Barak+Barif">Barak Barif</a></span>, writing for Project Syndicate, explained how the US, in particular, sees it as a priority to stay in the ‘Kingdoms’ good books</p> <p>The reality is heartbreaking when you acknowledge lives are being lost because of this mixture of geopolitical relationships, greed, and religious differences. Political and financial gain is valued higher than life, and worst of all, this depressing pattern is not isolated to Yemen. Look around, this order of prioritization can be seen all over the world, past, and present.</p> <p>It is for these reasons that we are unlikely to see any valuable development in the country until serious and restricting sanctions are upheld against Saudi Arabia and the ‘Arab coalition’, illustrating that international law cannot be ignored with a bottomless pocket.</p> <p><span>It is high time we hold those accountable for their roles of power, and we should never sit watching while a country suffers for over three years.</span></p> <p><span>To me, it’s this contradiction in values that draw us closer to political and civil disappearance, saying human rights must be upheld and even progressed can’t be altered when it does not align with a favourable agreement. It is this hypocrisy that fuels division and confusion we see throughout many aspects of our modern world. If the western world so desires to be world leaders, then it is time they started to act as such – by Luke Ambrose</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://medium.com/@lukejsambrose/nearly-four-years-of-yemeni-struggle-3c7b67bb3e71">https://medium.com/@lukejsambrose/nearly-four-years-of-yemeni-struggle-3c7b67bb3e71</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: Good article, but please get it correct: Saudi CONSULATE at Istanbul; and Fatik’s family name is Al-Rodaini.</span></p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Not Even Its Warring Parties Understand the War in Yemen, a Talk with Peter Salisbury</strong></p> <p>Why does this war appear designed to kill, maim and starve but not to be won? That’s the central question Al Bawaba asked Peter Salisbury, who has worked in and with Yemen for ten years, as a journalist and analyst. He’s now a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group and a Senior Consulting Fellow at Chatham House.</p> <p>Salisbury contends that solving the war in Yemen is difficult because the warring parties don’t really know what they’re doing, and have become so entangled in an ever-fragmenting war that they’re no longer sure what ‘victory’ looks like, if they ever knew in the first place.</p> <p>In his talk with Al Bawaba, Salisbury seeks to diagnose and fix the oversimplified narrative that there are effectively two sides in the conflict; pro-government and Houthi rebels backed by their respective global players who treat that conflict as a proxy between each other. In actuality, there are many sides who all have different internal dynamics, ethnicities, priorities, ideologies, goals and funding sources. These oversimplifications, Salisbury observes, have led to a chronic misunderstanding from both observers and warring parties regarding the war.</p> <p>“People struggle to deal with complexity,” Salisbury says, “but then the solutions they formulate are often based on simplified narratives.”</p> <p>“Then people make decisions based on the simplified narrative rather than the reality on the ground.” For him, that problem has plagued the war in Yemen, and is a central reason why peace is so elusive.</p> <p>The same mistakes are being repeated in Yemen, and the humanitarian consequences are dire.</p> <p>“Wishful thinking is not the same as strategic thinking,” says Salisbury. “It’s mind-blowing that people make these decisions based on wishful and poorly informed thinking.”</p> <p>“Yemen’s biggest problem is, when you break down responses to a lot of the things happening there, it’s very rarely about Yemen,” he adds.</p> <p>Leaders of countries carrying out the war in Yemen aren’t prioritizing issues within the country, but are treating it as merely a proxy conflict, a staging ground to resolve regional power disputes. No major warring party is looking to negotiate an end to the conflict yet. According to Salisbury, they are still positioning themselves to eventually achieve dominance, and are operating on an indefinite timeline.</p> <p>“The thing we’ve got to remember is that geopolitical interests add fuel to the flames, but the actual internal drivers of war and peace are always going to be rooted in the local. So what you end up with is people trying to serve their geopolitical interests and manipulate the situation and trying to make it into a proxy thing. But at the same time, not really having the actual leverage with the people on the ground needed to serve their strategic aims.”</p> <p>In his interview with Al Bawaba, Salisbury argues for an overarching review of how the international community understands legitimacy to better take into account local realities and perspectives.</p> <p>Actually listening to people in Yemen may be the difference between a stalemating, never-ending war, and a pragmatically negotiated peace.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.albawaba.com/news/not-even-its-warring-parties-understand-war-yemen-talk-peter-salisbury-1236956">https://www.albawaba.com/news/not-even-its-warring-parties-understand-war-yemen-talk-peter-salisbury-1236956</a></span></p> <p><span>and audio, full interview: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/eg/podcast/the-gateway-a-podcast-from-the-middle-east/id1391636214?mt=2">https://itunes.apple.com/eg/podcast/the-gateway-a-podcast-from-the-middle-east/id1391636214?mt=2</a> </span></p> <p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p> <p><strong>Yemen Data Project Air Raids Summary for 2018</strong></p> <p>Air raids in 2018 continue downward trend</p> <p>Bombings reached highest levels in Sa'ada and Al-Hudaydah since the air war began despite countywide fall</p> <p>Year End 2018 Data</p> <p>The Saudi/UAE-led coalition carried out 3,362 air raids in Yemen in 2018, a 36% fall from 2017 and the lowest number in any year since the bombing campaign began in March 2015.<br /> Bombings in Sa'ada and Al-Hudaydah reach record high in 2018</p> <p>The Yemen Data Project recorded a total of 19,123 coalition air raids* from 26 March 2015 to 31 December 2018, 23% of those bombings hit Yemen's most heavily targeted governorate of Saada.

In just three other months since March 2015 have air raids fallen below 200, two of those months were during the May-June 2016 ceasefire.<br /> The reduced number of air raids coincided with the an official ceasefire in Al-Hudaydah that came into force at midnight on 18 December. Only two air raids (on 27 and 31 December) were recorded in the governorate after that date. Bombings continued elsewhere, mainly in Sa'ada but also in lesser numbers in Hajja, Sana'a governorate, Al-Jawf and Marib.<br /> Above average bombing of non-military sites in December (38%) continued the pattern seen since June 2018. Following the launch of the Saudi/UAE-led coalition's <em>Operation Golden Victory </em>against pro-Houthi forces in Al-Hudaydah in June above average civilian targeting was recorded in <span><a href="https://mailchi.mp/04ccee3fac00/august2018-yemen-data-project-update-382175?e=c5a23e9692">July </a></span>(43%), <span><a href="https://mailchi.mp/f47262abc07d/september2018-yemen-data-project-update-389115">August</a></span>(39%) and <span><a href="https://mailchi.mp/552268b97b7a/november2018-yemen-data-project-update-422475?e=%5bUNIQID%5d">October</a></span> (43%). <span><a href="https://us16.campaign-archive.com/?u=1912a1b11cab332fa977d3a6a&amp;id=25158e3173">September 2018 </a></span> saw the highest level (48%) of civilian targeting since the air campaign began, matching the previous highest rate in a single month of 48% in October 2015.

In December that focus reduced somewhat with 60% or air raids hitting these two governorates (infographics)</p> <p><span><a href="https://mailchi.mp/5ccc4f828655/january2019-yemen-data-project-update-456659">https://mailchi.mp/5ccc4f828655/january2019-yemen-data-project-update-456659</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p> <p><strong><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/msf">Médecins Sans Frontières</a>: Trapped by mines</strong></p> <p>In early 2018, fighting intensified along the frontline between the cities of Taiz and Hodeidah by Ansar Allah troops and forces supported by the Saudi and Emirati-led coalition. The coalition-backed forces advanced on the strategic port of Hodeidah, on the Red Sea, before launching an attack on the city on 13 June 2018.</p> <p>In an effort to prevent the advance of the coalition’s ground troops, thousands of mines and improvised explosive devices were planted across the region’s roads and fields. The principal victims of these lethal hazards have been civilians, many of whom have been killed or maimed for life after unwittingly stepping on an explosive device.</p> <p>MSF set up a hospital in the city of Mocha, in Taiz governorate, in August 2018, where our teams perform emergency surgery on people injured by mines – one-third of them children.</p> <p>We urge the authorities as well as specialist organisations to step up mine clearance operations to reduce the number of people killed and injured by explosive devices in civilian areas.</p> <p>With only a handful of signs indicating the presence of mines and only a few red-painted stones showing where it’s safe to walk, every day a muffled bang signals that yet another explosive device has been triggered.</p> <p>Before the war, the area between Mocha and the frontline was agricultural. Since the fighting started, towns and villages near the combat zones – such as Hays and Mafraq Al Mocha, where MSF provides support to advanced medical posts – have seen many of their inhabitants flee.</p> <p>The surrounding fields have been mined to prevent the advance of military troops, making them impossible to cultivate and depriving the local population of their livelihood.</p> <p>A 45-minute drive from Mocha, Mawza district has seen its population halve. “People who live here are punished – not once, but twice. The mines not only blow up their children but also prevent them from cultivating their fields. They lose their source of income as well as food for their families,” says Claire Ha-Duong, MSF head of mission in Yemen.</p> <p>Between August and December 2018, MSF’s teams in Mocha admitted and treated more than 150 people wounded by mines, improvised explosive devices and unexploded ordnance. One third of the patients were children who had been playing in fields. Disabled for life, they face an uncertain future.</p> <p>By creating generations of maimed people, mines have far-reaching repercussions – not only for individual families, but for society as a whole, as their victims are likely to be more dependent on others at the same time as being more socially isolated.</p> <p>Thousands upon thousands of explosive devices will endanger the lives of people in Yemen for decades to come.</p> <p>UK-based organisation Conflict Armament Research pointed in a recent report to Ansar Allah’s large-scale mass-production of mines and improvised explosive devices, as well as its use of anti-personnel, vehicle and naval mines.</p> <p>According to the Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre, the Yemeni army cleared 300,000 mines between 2016 and 2018.</p> <p>Managed almost exclusively by the military, mine clearance is focused on roads and strategic infrastructure, with little heed paid to civilian areas.</p> <p>Not a day goes by without war-wounded people like Ali and Omar arriving at MSF’s hospital in Mocha from the frontlines between Taiz and Hodeidah.</p> <p>Aden, where MSF opened a specialist trauma hospital in 2012, is 450 kilometres from Hodeidah. Although there is medical care available in Aden, most Yemenis don’t have the money to pay for treatment or the transport to travel there.</p> <p>It takes six to eight hours to drive to Aden from Hodeidah. The area between the two cities has become a medical wasteland for the people who live there.</p> <p>MSF’s hospital in Mocha is the only facility in the region with an operating theatre and the capacity to perform surgery.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.msf.org/trapped-mines-yemen">https://www.msf.org/trapped-mines-yemen</a></span><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/trapped-mines">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/trapped-mines</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p> <p><strong>Inside the Yemeni school where childhood doesn't exist</strong></p> <p>Several schools in the capital have abandoned classes, instead serving as shelters for thousands of displaced families.</p> <p>Six months ago, Ahmad would spend most his lunch breaks running around with his best friend Hesham, playing football in his school playground in the port city of Hodeidah.</p> <p>But since fighting erupted in his neighbourhood last June, Ahmad found himself enduring a rather different school experience.</p> <p>He fled to Sanaa with his parents and younger sister. The family now sleeps on thin mattresses on the cold floor of Muhammad Abdullah Saleh school in the capital.

Never has a single country had so many military bases on so many parts of Planet Earth. Consider that a striking fact of 2019, as it was, say, of the 1950s or the post-Cold-War 1990s. How many such bases? As Turse makes clear, no one really knows, possibly not even the Pentagon. And more curious yet, that vast global infrastructure, that “empire of bases” (in Chalmers Johnson’s <span><a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/1181/chalmers_johnson_on_garrisoning_the_planet">eloquent phrase</a></span>), is hardly noticed in what, since 9/11, has been known as “the homeland.” Few here think much about those global garrisons (although hundreds of thousands of Americans have in recent years been deployed to them); the media that cover every presidential tweet as if it were a missive from the emperor almost never mention them, much less report on them; and no one -- Turse and a <span><a href="https://www.overseasbases.net/for-media.html">few scholars</a></span> aside -- seems to have the slightest interest in counting them up, much less considering their cost or even the global role they’ve been playing all these years. In domestic terms, they are essentially missing in action, which means a vision of how the United States has positioned itself on this planet is missing in action as well.</p> <p>With that in mind, let’s acknowledge something else in this strange moment of ours: while that massive (and massively expensive) base structure remains firmly in place, American imperial power is increasingly another matter.</p> <p>Bases, Bases, Everywhere... Except in the Pentagon’s Report</p> <p>Officially, the Department of Defense (DoD) maintains 4,775 “sites,” spread across all 50 states, eight U.S. territories, and 45 foreign countries. A total of 514 of these outposts are located overseas, according to the Pentagon’s <span><a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/BSI/Base%20Structure%20Report%20FY17.pdf">worldwide property portfolio</a></span>. Just to start down a long list, these include bases on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa, as well as in Peru and Portugal, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. But the most recent version of that portfolio, issued in early 2018 and known as the Base Structure Report (BSR), doesn’t include any mention of al-Tanf. Or, for that matter, any other base in Syria. Or Iraq. Or Afghanistan. Or Niger. Or Tunisia. Or Cameroon. Or Somalia. Or any number of locales where such military outposts are known to exist and even, unlike in Syria, <span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/12/01/u-s-military-says-it-has-a-light-footprint-in-africa-these-documents-show-a-vast-network-of-bases/">to be expanding</a></span>.</p> <p>According to David Vine, author of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1627791698/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">Base Nation: How U.S. Military Bases Abroad Harm America and the World</a></em>, there could be hundreds of similar off-the-books bases around the world. “The missing sites are a reflection of the lack of transparency involved in the system of what I still estimate to be around 800 U.S. bases outside the 50 states and Washington, D.C., that have been encircling the globe since World War II,” says Vine, who is also a founding member of the recently established <span><a href="https://www.overseasbases.net/">Overseas Base Realignment and Closure Coalition</a></span>, a group of military analysts from across the ideological spectrum who advocate shrinking the U.S. military’s global “footprint.”</p> <p>Such off-the-books bases are off the books for a reason. The Pentagon doesn’t want to talk about them.</p> <p>“Undocumented bases are immune to oversight by the public and often even Congress,” Vine explains. “Bases are a physical manifestation of U.S. foreign and military policy, so off-the-books bases mean the military and executive branch are deciding such policy without public debate, frequently spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars and potentially getting the U.S. involved in wars and conflicts about which most of the country knows nothing.”</p> <p>Where Are They?</p> <p>The Overseas Base Realignment and Closure Coalition notes that the United Statespossesses up to 95% of the world’s foreign military bases, while countries like France, Russia, and the United Kingdom have perhaps 10-20 foreign outposts each. China has <span><a href="https://thediplomat.com/2018/12/chinas-djibouti-base-a-one-year-update/">just one</a></span>.</p> <p>The Department of Defense even <span><a href="https://www.defense.gov/Our-Story/">boasts</a></span> that its “locations” include 164 countries. Put another way, it has a military presence of some sort in approximately 84% of the nations on this <span><a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-many-countries-are-in-the-world.html">planet</a></span> -- or at least the DoD briefly claimed this.</p> <p>What the Pentagon still doesn’t say is how it defines a “location.” The number 164 does roughly track with the Department of Defense’s current <span><a href="https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/rest/download?fileName=DMDC_Website_Location_Report_1806.xlsx&amp;groupName=milRegionCountry">manpower statistics</a></span>, which show personnel deployments of varying sizes in 166 “overseas” locales.</p> <p>The annual cost of deploying U.S. military personnel overseas, as well as maintaining and running those foreign bases, tops out at an estimated $150 billion annually, according to the Overseas Bases Realignment and Closure Coalition. The price tag for the outposts alone adds up to about one-third of that total. “U.S. bases abroad cost upwards of $50 billion per year to build and maintain, which is money that could be used to address pressing needs at home in education, health care, housing, and infrastructure,” Vine points out.</p> <p>Perhaps you won’t be surprised to learn that the Pentagon is also somewhat fuzzy about just where its troops are stationed. – by Nick Turse</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/176513/tomgram:_nick_turse,_one_down,_who_knows_how_many_to_go/">http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/176513/tomgram:_nick_turse,_one_down,_who_knows_how_many_to_go/</a></span> = <a href="https://grayzoneproject.com/2019/01/15/us-military-160-countries-pentagon-hiding-numbers/">https://grayzoneproject.com/2019/01/15/us-military-160-countries-pentagon-hiding-numbers/</a> </p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2> <p>(* B H)</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/mahwit?epa=HASHTAG">#Mahwit</a></span>: 441 rabies cases in 2018<br /> The report from the Republican Hospital in Mahwit province confirmed that last year the hospital received 441 cases of rabies. 192 cases were given the vaccine, 249 were left uncovered for lack of the life-saving vaccine.<br /> Dr al-Showa underlined that the population of rabid dogs has increased dramatically in the cities stressing that in the absence of treatment, the only solution is to carry out regular campaigns to exterminate stray dogs.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/photos/a.961595153893515/2091465597573126/">https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/photos/a.961595153893515/2091465597573126/</a></span></p> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>600,000 Cases of Malaria in Yemen : Report</p> <p>A report issued by the Yemeni Health Ministry has recorded more than 600 thousand cases of malaria in 2018 .

Both the rebels and the Saudi-led coalition fighting them, as well as the U.S., continue to use them for surveillance and attacks.</p> <p>But while the U.S. uses American-made drones and the coalition has turned to Chinese suppliers, the manufacturer of the Houthis' drones in both the air and the sea has been a contentious question.</p> <p>A 2018 report by a United Nations panel of experts on Yemen looked particularly at the Houthis' Qatef-1 drone.</p> <p>"Although Houthi-aligned media announced that the Sana'a-based ministry of defence manufactured the (drone), in reality they are assembled from components supplied by an outside source and shipped into Yemen," the report said. The Qatef, or "Striker," ''is virtually identical in design, dimensions and capability to that of the Ababil-T, manufactured by the Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries."</p> <p>The Qatef-2K, which the Houthis said they used in Thursday's attack, similarly resembles the Iranian designs.</p> <p>A research group called Conflict Armament Research, with the permission of the United Arab Emirates' elite Presidential Guard, also examined seized drones used by the Houthis and their allies to crash into Patriot missile batteries in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.islandpacket.com/news/business/article224230170.html">https://www.islandpacket.com/news/business/article224230170.html</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/how-yemen-s-rebels-increasingly-deploy-drones-1.563946">https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/how-yemen-s-rebels-increasingly-deploy-drones-1.563946</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** A K)</strong></p> <p><strong>Houthis Use Armed Drone to Target Yemeni Army Top Brass</strong></p> <p>On January 10, 2019 a drone <span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-46822429">reportedly</a></span> targeted a Yemeni government base during a military parade, allegedly killing six people and wounding many others, including several senior officers. Analysis of the attack indicates that a variant of an Ababil T drone, referred to as a Qasef 1 by Houthi forces, was used to attack the parade. This article will analyse the event and its potential implications.</p> <p>Fragments seen in videos and images of the attack, as well as the distinctive shape of the drone seen in videos, indicate that it is from the Iranian designed Ababil II family. A version of the Ababil II, the Ababil T, has been used the Houthis under the name <span><a href="http://www.yemenextra.net/2018/04/11/yemen-drones-target-airport-of-abah-and-aramco-company/">Qasef 1</a></span>.</p> <p>An engine recovered after the attack appears to be a DLE 111 petrol engine, the same kind found by Conflict Armament Research (CAR) in the Ababil T</p> <p>Other fragments also appeared to fit the front canard and rear wings of an Ababil T.</p> <p>The Houthis have consistently claimed that the Qasef 1 is among their several domestically designed and manufactured drones, but a thorough <span><a href="http://www.conflictarm.com/download-file/?report_id=2465&amp;file_id=2467">investigation</a></span> by CAR indicated that these drones are in fact likely smuggled into Yemen from Iran. The Houthis have also <span><a href="http://www.yemenextra.net/2018/04/11/yemen-drones-target-airport-of-abah-and-aramco-company/">claimed</a></span> to have developed a manufacturing base and to have started producing these drones within Yemen, which should certainly be regarded as a possibility.</p> <p>This event is a major demonstration of Houthi capabilities. Although Ababil T’s have reportedly been <span><a href="http://www.conflictarm.com/download-file/?report_id=2465&amp;file_id=2467">used</a></span> to attack Saudi Arabian Patriot missile radar arrays, this event is rather more complex. While radar arrays are relatively static, the guests at this parade would have been mobile, only sitting at the dais for a limited window of time.</p> <p>The Houthis would have had to know where and when this parade was going to happen, and know exactly when to launch a single drone in order to hit the dais when it was full of high-value targets. Considering the extraordinary nature of this attack, it also seems likely they knew that several high-ranking officers would be present.</p> <p>This event marks a significant milestone during the conflict in Yemen, as well as the application of basic armed drones to conflict in general.

rebels on pro-government senior officials attending a military parade in the country's southern province of Lahj could jeopardize the ongoing efforts to end the country's conflict peacefully, observers said.</p> <p>"The attack on the Anad air base was a clear indication that the Houthi group does not want to abide by the peace agreements and had repeatedly breached several truces," said Salah Bin Laghbar, a political analyst and writer based in Aden.</p> <p>"The Houthis used the cease-fire period just to prepare for such attacks against the government forces with no respect for the agreement signed between the two warring sides in Sweden," Salah said.</p> <p>According to Abdul-Raqeeb Hidyani, a political observer, the attack on the government senior leaders may lead to intensified attacks against the rebels-held areas in the next days.</p> <p>"The government apparently received a huge blow but it will not tolerate the perpetrators of the attack and may launch attacks against key Houthi sites as a response," Hidyani said.</p> <p>"The Houthis bear the whole responsibility for the latest escalation because they completely neglected the UN role and planned to

Approximately 22.2 million people - 75 per cent of the population - are in need of humanitarian assistance. A total of 17.8 million people are food insecure and 8.4 million people do not know how they will obtain their next meal. Conflict, protracted displacement, disease and deprivation continue to inflict suffering on the country’s population. Disruption to commercial imports, inflation, lack of salary payment to civil servants and rising prices of basic commodities exacerbate people’s vulnerability. Despite a difficult operating environment 242 international and national partners in January through October were actively coordinating to assist people with the most acute needs in priority districts across Yemen’s 22 governorates.

They couldn’t leave their house due to the fighting.</p> <p>While they were holed up, the boy’s father and one of his brothers were shot. Their house was caught in the crossfire. Sadly, they were killed.</p> <p>Despite the horror he experienced, the boy had kept to his programme of rehabilitation. He'd done everything he could to strengthen his leg to make sure he’d be able to have the fixator removed.</p> <p>He is one of seven children and, now with his father gone, he was determined to walk so he could find work.

The detainees were women who protested the repression and terrorism policies and peacefully asked for freedom of opinion and expression, which became a crime according to the Houthis.<br /> Houthi leaders arrested girls who received phone calls from the group’s women security team, and after meeting them, they were immediately attacked and taken to detention centers to be brutally tortured and forced into giving false confessions, sources told the Team.<br /> Citizens now fear for the safety of their women even if they leave the house for school, university, or even the hospital after these arrests and crimes have significantly increased, added the statement.<br /> The Team called on the relevant parties of international, regional and local organizations to arrest the perpetrators and pressure the militias to release the detainees.<br /> It held the Houthis responsible for the safety of the detainees and their families, including any physical, mental or psychological harm they may cause.<br /> Houthis have recently stepped up crackdowns on Yemeni women activists and terrorized their families, claiming they were banning social association between men and women.</p> <p><span><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1542866/yemeni-rights-team-uncovers-houthi-detention-centers-torturing-women">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1542866/yemeni-rights-team-uncovers-houthi-detention-centers-torturing-women</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://republicanyemen.net/archives/13402">https://republicanyemen.net/archives/13402</a></span></p> <p><span>and in short </span><span><a href="https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-26828">https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-26828</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: By Saudi news site, to be read with care, until more information is received.

Should this be a deflection from the Saudi PR disaster caused by the Saudi reactions to a young woman’s escape from Saudi Arabia (look at cp8b) and the newest awareness of Saudis’ treatment of women?

The couple were tried for adultery and executed.</p> <p>But the number of young women considering and taking the enormous risk to flee Saudi Arabia appears to have grown in recent years, rights groups say, as women frustrated by social and legal constraints at home turn to social media to help plan, and sometimes document, their efforts to escape.</p> <p>All these women who 15 years ago would have never been heard from can now find a way to reach out,” said Adam Coogle, who monitors Saudi Arabia for Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>Some who dare to leave slip out quietly, traveling to the United States or elsewhere before applying for asylum — which is never a sure thing. Since being stopped in Turkey in 2017, two sisters, Ashwaq and Areej Hamoud, 31 and 29 respectively, have been <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/15/turkey-saudi-sisters-risk-forced-return">fighting a deportation order</a></span> in court, saying they fear for their lives if they return to Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>For other women, like Ms. Alqunun, publicity played a key role in their successful escapes, but even global attention does not guarantee that a woman will not be repatriated.</p> <p>In 2017, Dina Ali Lasloom, 24, begged for help in a widely viewed online video after she was stopped while transiting in the Philippines. She was held at the airport until family members arrived and took her back to Saudi Arabia, where it is unclear what happened to her.</p> <p>The women who make it out must contend not only with their families’ efforts to force them home, but also with the Saudi government’s extensive and well-financed efforts to do so, often involving local diplomats pressing for repatriation.</p> <p>Women who are repatriated can face criminal charges of parental disobedience or harming the kingdom’s reputation.</p> <p>A few months before Ms. Alqunun left her family during a trip to Kuwait, for instance, a friend of hers had fled and reached Australia as a refugee and was giving her advice about escaping.</p> <p>Many fled from Turkey, a popular Saudi vacation spot, to Georgia, which Saudis can enter without a visa. And many aimed for Australia because they could apply for visas online, the only option for women who could not get to a foreign embassy.</p> <p>A few months before Ms. Alqunun left her family during a trip to Kuwait, for instance, a friend of hers had fled and reached Australia as a refugee and was giving her advice about escaping.</p> <p>Many fled from Turkey, a popular Saudi vacation spot, to Georgia, which Saudis can enter without a visa. And many aimed for Australia because they could apply for visas online, the only option for women who could not get to a foreign embassy.</p> <p>Some said they had fled because of abuse by male relatives and because they felt that the kingdom offered nowhere to turn for protection or justice.</p> <p>Others wanted out of the kingdom’s strict, Islamic social codes, which limit what women can wear, which jobs they can pursue and with whom they can socialize. And all spoke of wanting to escape the kingdom’s male guardianship laws, which give men great power over the lives of female relatives.</p> <p>“It is male guardianship that made us flee from Saudi Arabia,” said Ms. Muhaimeed, in Sweden. “That is the biggest reason that the girls flee.”</p> <p>Saudi men use a government website to manage the women they have guardianship over, granting or denying them the right to travel, for example, and even setting up notifications so that they receive a text message when their wife or daughter boards a plane. – By <span>Ben Hubbard</span> and <span>Richard C.

In what way? For the most part, they did not say.</p> <p>Tom Malinowski, the freshman congressman from New Jersey, was the exception.</p> <p>Malinowski met Khashoggi just a few months before his murder in October at a small gathering in Northern Virginia, he said. Khashoggi told the congressional candidate and former assistant secretary of state that he worried about the decline of “America’s moral voice” in the world, particularly in the Arab world.</p> <p>“We talked about what that might mean for the courageous democracy activists from Saudi Arabia to Egypt to Bahrain who could once count on America at least to try to restrain their regimes from persecuting them,” Malinowski said.</p> <p>Malinowski, who was the State Department’s top human-rights official during the Obama administration’s second term, was previously the Washington director of the advocacy group Human Rights Watch—a crusader from the outside who exerted pressure on the U.S. government over <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716208317118">domestic torture practices</a></span> and <span><a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/19/tom-malinowski-man-who-argued-with-dictators-215278">U.S. diplomatic ties</a></span> to foreign governments with questionable human-rights records.

If there is anything wrong with the Middle East, it’s Barack Obama’s fault for being, in Pompeo’s telling, too weak, too friendly with the enemy – Iran again.</p> <p>Pompeo, unlike his boss, knows how cynical this approach is and how unconvincing it will be in the region, which is probably why he barely mentioned Saudi Arabia at all. Instead, Pompeo ran down a long list of countries from Egypt (a Saudi client under <span><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/el-sisi-is-the-putin-of-the-nile">President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi</a></span>) to Bahrain (little more than a Saudi appendage) before finally, softly, mentioning that “Saudi Arabia, too, has worked with us to counter Iranian expansion and regional influence.”</p> <p>At times, Pompeo strained so hard to justify the incautious words and capricious decisions of President Trump that the spectacle was pitiable.</p> <p>For the rest, in a part of the world where people really do remember the past, Pompeo tried to reinvent the timelines of the last two decades.</p> <p>Pompeo said the fight will go on with allies shouldering more of the burden – meaning, we know from other speeches, the Saudis.</p> <p>Good luck with that.

There was no “Iranian expansion” underway in Yemen in 2015 and there still isn’t one, and to the extent that Iran has gained influenced over the last four years it has been because of the Saudi coalition’s destructive, atrocious intervention. Our involvement in and support for the Saudi coalition war and blockade have been a moral and strategic disaster for the United States, and the Trump administration is responsible for keeping that policy going the entire time they have been in power.</p> <p>The Secretary cannot square his self-righteous pronouncements about America as a “force for good” with the policy of backing the Saudi coalition as it massacres civilians and causes millions to starve, and so as usual he pretends that the real problems are Iran and imaginary threats to international trade. Even if Iran posed the threat that Pompeo claims, it wouldn’t begin to justify what our government has helped the Saudis and Emiratis do to the people of Yemen. Our government’s policy of supporting the war on Yemen has already made us an accomplice in the preventable deaths of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from hunger and disease, and it has made us party to creating the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

Yes, he was himself an intelligence operative.</p> <p>Khashoggi was handled on behalf of the Qataris by former U.S. foreign service officer Maggie Mitchell Salem, an executive at the Qatar Foundation International.</p> <p>Yet the entire story about Khashoggi—that he was a U.S. person, a dissident, a journalist—was false. He was a Saudi national whose murder was used to launch a successful intelligence operation targeting his home country and U.S. policy. The news was fake, but the information campaign set off by his murder was real.</p> <p>In retrospect, the only surprising thing about the Khashoggi information operation was that so many members of Trump’s own party took the bait.</p> <p>Were they all suckers? The Khashoggi operation was simply the latest iteration in a series of ongoing, now <span><a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/tag/news-of-the-news">apparently unending</a></span>, campaigns joining partisan political operatives, the press, and intelligence services to undermine Trump policies.</p> <p>Which is it?

Nor are they attempts to explore any kind of human truth. Nor are they politics as usual. They are a new kind of weapon, like an improvised explosive device, stuffed with rat poison, loose screws, broken glass, whatever is at hand and seems likely to kill or maim.

First, it will undoubtedly be conducted in cooperation with the Russian navy, which has been increasing its patrols in the approaches to the continental U.S. Second, it is an indication of how Iranians truly believe themselves to be a global power.</p> <p>First, we need to increase intelligence collection focused on Iran’s internal debates over global strategy.</p> <p>Working militarily with our allies, partners and friends – both in the region and globally – is a second key.</p> <p>Third, we must continue to use targeted economic sanctions. Some big nations – including Russia and China – will probably not cooperate. But the U.S. and Europe collectively represent over 50 percent of global GDP.</p> <p>As for Iran’s navy, it has strong capabilities to create mischief in the Arabian Gulf and the northern Indian Ocean.</p> <p>Bombing Iran now would be a grave mistake.

The author takes it for granted that principially America is a better and privileged nation, compared to others (“American exceptionalism”). While it’s taken for granted that America dominates the whole world and that American military might be present and operate everywhere on this planet, others might not. For the author, the idea of Iranian navy ships in waters close to the US is horrible and unacceptable, while since many decades the US navy is operating in the Persian Gulf close to the Iranian coast. This is paranoid.</span></p> <p><span>The author pledges for economic sanctions against Iran (again we must ask: for which serious reason? Regime change?).

She has witnessed first-hand Socotra’s transformation from a marginalised region, stranded in the Indian Ocean more than 322 kilometres south of Yemen and about 96 kilometres east of the horn of Africa, to a popular tourist destination, after the island was made a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2008 in recognition of its striking flora and fauna (Socotra is often referred to as “the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean”). More recently, Socotra’s situation has changed again, the ongoing civil war in Yemen, as well as a pair of devastating cyclones in 2015, destroying the tourism industry.</p> <p>'Islands of Heritage'</p> <p>Peutz has now written a fascinating book, <em>Islands of Heritage: Conservation and Transformation in Yemen</em>, in which she explores the ways the people of Socotra have responded to the increasing influence of outside forces on their island. <em>Islands of ­Heritage</em> is less about the animals and plants that make Socotra unique and more about the impact of <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/uae-organisation-delivers-cooking-gas-to-socotra-residents-to-prevent-deforestation-1.798190">conservation efforts</a> on the islanders; it is about language and culture and what happens to these when an island experiences rapid and radical change.</p> <p>Too often, she argues, ­Socotrans are muscled out of the limelight by <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/uae/special-report-paradise-regained-in-socotra-1.748230">the very island they inhabit</a> – either because of its biodiversity (“Outsiders linking Socotrans’ value to their environment,” says Peutz) or because of its strategic significance. This book places the Socotrans front and centre.</p> <p>The influence of external powers</p> <p>At the heart of <em>Islands of Heritage</em> is the question of whether or not it is ever beneficial, particularly in terms of conservation and heritage, for external powers to influence and intervene. “Socotra is interesting to me because what is going on there is going on all over the world,” says Peutz. “People are worried about cultural loss, language loss and how to retain what it is that makes them distinctive.”</p> <p>Distinctively Socotran</p> <p>What is interesting, though, is that when it comes to heritage, the islanders have managed much more effectively to withstand external pressures. They have curated their own type of heritage, one they recognise as Socotran, rather than one foisted upon them.</p> <p>Heritage, which is normally considered conservative, became a rallying call of the Socotran revolution, a vehicle for change. As Peutz explained in a talk last year: “Heritage is what you make it, and if it’s your language, your poetry, your ideas, your history, it can really mobilise people.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/how-the-yemeni-island-of-socotra-is-forging-its-own-future-1.809600">https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/how-the-yemeni-island-of-socotra-is-forging-its-own-future-1.809600</a></p> <p>My comment: This is a serious article on Socotra and Peutz’ work on an UAE news site. Only a few lines are reserved for propaganda whitewashing the UAEs grip on the island (“The UAE's support of Socotra“).</p> <p>Comment: Well I'm not too sure about this - the author is UAE based and it is difficult to be critical. It's my information that UAE is trying to control the island, initially sending its own troops. When there were protests, the Socatrans agreed instead to be trained to 'defend' Socotra - in other words, they would do the work of UAE soldiers - meanwhile, I hear some Socatrans who toe the line have been offered UAE nationality as a 'reward' for their loyalty. The UAE is funding the development of naval and air bases for military purposes and the development of hotels and a tourist industry that may not be compatible with the conservation needs of this amazing island that I was fortunate enough to visit in 1999.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157282982923641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157282982923641</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vorige / Previous</span></h2> <p><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-500-yemen-war-mosaic-500">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-500-yemen-war-mosaic-500</a></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 1-500 / Yemen War Mosaic 1-500:</span></h2> <p><span><a href="/autoren/dklose">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose</a></span> oder / or <span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Der saudische Luftkrieg im Bild / Saudi aerial war images:</span></h2> <p>(18 +, Nichts für Sensible!) / (18 +; Graphic!)</p> <p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/">http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="http://www.yemenwar.info/">http://www.yemenwar.info/</a></span></p> <p>und alle Liste aller Luftangriffe / and list of all air raids:</p> <p><span><a href="http://yemendataproject.org/data/">http://yemendataproject.org/data/</a></span></p></div>
