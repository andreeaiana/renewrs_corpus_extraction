Perhaps because the US is partly responsible for the crisis. </p><p>Saudi Arabia is the <a href="https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2019/global-arms-trade-usa-increases-dominance-arms-flows-middle-east-surge-says-sipri">world’s largest importer of weapons</a> and the US is its biggest supplier. </p><p>So once again, why aren’t we hearing about Yemen?</p><p>Because Yemen is a perfect example of Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman’s victims theory. </p><p>The theory <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/worthy-and-unworthy-victims/5545">stipulates</a> that, in the eyes of news organizations, there are worthy and unworthy victims. In the twenty-first century, worthy victims are generally Westerners who are killed or severely injured in terrorist attacks (e.g. victims of 9/11) while unworthy victims are non-Westerners who are killed by Western military operations (e.g. Yemeni civilians.) </p><p>Essentially, atrocities committed by the US are far less likely to be covered than those committed by other, non-Western nations.</p><p>And while major Western news outlets may cover deadly airstrikes in Yemen, they largely avoid discussing US and Saudi military relations. An <a href="https://apnews.com/17dca7a0cab9057ee838d4a7f0c92fc0">Associated Press</a> piece, for example, covered a Saudi coalition airstrike that killed 13 Yemeni civilians earlier this month, but failed to mention that the US government provides weapons and intelligence to the coalition.</p><p>With that in mind, reporting on Yemen requires American journalists to confront the dark reality that the US is complicit in war crimes against the Yemenis. It requires them to dig deep into America’s long, unsavory and bloody history in the Middle East and examine our relationship with the Saudi Arabian government, which <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/saudi-arabia">has a nauseating record</a> of human rights violations. </p><p>It is much easier to ignore the truth than it is to confront it. </p><p>But the crisis in Yemen grows increasingly grim. They need humanitarian assistance and for US involvement to end now.</p><p>Journalists hold the key to public knowledge. They dictate to the public what is important to know about and what is not. </p><p>Yemen desperately needs public awareness and aid right now. Otherwise, they might not survive.</p><p><span><a href="http://www.mediafiledc.com/why-you-havent-heard-about-yemen/">http://www.mediafiledc.com/why-you-havent-heard-about-yemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>First You Bomb and Starve a Country. Then You’re Praised for Sending in Aid.</strong></p><p>The perverse diplomatic charade of Saudi Arabia starting a fire then getting credit for providing fire blankets.</p><p>The United Nations <span><a href="https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/preamble/index.html">describes</a></span> itself in its charter as an international moral authority created to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.” But activists who are trying to end the U.S. war on Yemen say that, in a dark twist on this mission, the international body is withholding criticism from the U.S.-Saudi military coalition, and effusively praising its leaders, to avoid jeopardizing donations to humanitarian funds aimed at helping ease the suffering created by that war. As Jehan Hakim, the chair of the Yemeni Alliance Committee, puts it, “The same hand we're asking to feed Yemen is the same hand that is helping bomb them.”</p><p>On June 15, UN Secretary-General António Guterres removed the U.S.-Saudi military coalition, which has been waging war in Yemen for more than five years, from an international blacklist of states and armed groups responsible for killing and maiming children, in a huge P.R. win for Saudi Arabia. He cited a supposed decrease in child killings, even as he acknowledged the coalition was responsible for killing 222 children last year, 171 of them from bombings—a number that certainly does not include the toll of <span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/yemens-dead-and-injured-children-haunt-saudi-led-war/a-53854932">famine</a></span> and <span><a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/22404/yemen-war-saudi-arabia-united-states-coronavirus-medical-system">disease outbreaks</a></span> (including <span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/war-ravaged-yemen-facing-deadly-new-threat-in-covid-19">Covid-19</a></span>) worsened by the war and blockade.

On June 2, the UN co-hosted a virtual donors’ summit with Saudi Arabia to raise money for humanitarian relief in Yemen, which is being devastated by Covid-19, in large part because the U.S.-Saudi coalition has <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39651265">decimated</a></span> its hospital system, and a Saudi-led blockade is cutting off critical medical supplies. Guterres, who made the recent decision to scrub Saudi Arabia from the blacklist, gave the <span><a href="https://www.unocha.org/sites/unocha/files/English%20UN%20Secretary-General%20Opening%20Remarks%20Yemen%20HLPE%202%20June%202020.pdf">opening remarks</a></span> for the event. “I thank the Government of Saudi Arabia for co-hosting this pledging event, and for your continued commitment to humanitarian aid to the people of Yemen,” he said.</p><p>Saudi Arabia was the highest donor at the event, <span><a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/note-correspondents/2020-06-02/note-correspondents-high-level-pledging-event-for-yemen-pledging-result">pledging</a></span> a token $500 million in aid, the exact amount of money Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, <span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mohammed-bin-salman-saudi-prince-net-worth-yacht-private-jet-lifestyle-2019-5">spent</a></span> on his personal yacht. The United States pledged $225 million, or less than the cost of three of the numerous F35 fighter jets the U.S. military <span><a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/us/pentagon-purchases-hundreds-more-f-35s-as-military-misses-its-combat-readiness-goal-for-the-jets-1.605093">has purchased</a></span> from Lockheed Martin.</p><p>These numbers also pale in comparison to the value of the arms the United States ships to Saudi Arabia—amounting to at <span><a href="http://securityassistance.org/data/program/arms/Saudi%20Arabia/2019/2020/Global/all">least $3 billion</a></span> in 2019—despite calls for a global embargo due to Saudi atrocities in Yemen. Yet the event, the global equivalent of a GoFundMe campaign for Yemen aid, fell $1 billion <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52903440">short</a></span> of its goal, or roughly the equivalent of only two of the Leonardo Da Vinci paintings bin Salman <span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/07/569142929/mystery-solved-saudi-prince-is-buyer-of-450m-davinci-painting">bought</a></span> for himself in 2017.</p><p>El-Tayyab says he is concerned about whether the U.S. aid that was pledged will be sent to Houthi-held areas, where a majority of Yemen’s population lives. “We don't know if the aid is going to get to north Yemen,” he said.</p><p>Shireen Al-Adeimi, Yemeni-American anti-war activist, board member of Just Foreign Policy, and <span><a href="https://inthesetimes.com/community/profile/322961">frequent contributor</a></span> to <em>In These Times</em>, agreed with El-Tayyab’s explanation for why the coalition was removed from the UN blacklist. According to Al-Adeimi, the UN lives in fear that the very countries responsible for unleashing humanitarian crises will withdraw funding for humanitarian aid.</p><p>One could argue that the UN is forced to perform ethical gymnastics, due the Trump administration’s abrupt <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/as-coronavirus-looms-us-proceeds-with-dramatic-reduction-of-aid-to-yemen/2020/03/26/61c15a00-6f77-11ea-96a0-df4c5d9284af_story.html">withdrawal</a></span> of tens of millions of dollars in assistance from USAID, the World Food Programme’s 50% <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52239645">cut</a></span> to aid in Houthi-held areas, and threats to <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/us-aid-cuts-are-deepening-yemens-misery-now-comes-the-coronavirus/2020/04/23/649ce02a-82e9-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html">close</a></span> critical UN-run food aid programs in Yemen, all as Covid-19 is battering the country. The UN has no choice, therefore, but to do what any fundraiser must do: cavort with unsavory donors, and flatter the wealthy in hopes that they will keep the organization afloat.</p><p>But the UN is not just a passive observer of the Yemen war: By shielding the United States and Saudi Arabia from even the most modest political consequences for a war that has unleashed the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, it has used its institutional power to enable this onslaught. In 2015, just six months into the war, Saudi Arabia launched a diplomatic campaign to prevent the UN from launching a human rights investigation, <span><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/09/25/will-saudi-arabia-stop-un-investigating-its-war-atrocities-yemen">abetted</a></span> by the silence of the Obama administration.

With machine learning, it takes just days.</p><p>organizations have increasingly turned to crowdsourced mobile photos and videos to understand the conflict, and have begun submitting them to court to supplement eyewitness evidence.</p><p>But as digital documentation of war scenes has proliferated, the time it takes to analyze it has exploded. The disturbing imagery can also traumatize the investigators who must comb through and watch the footage. Now <span><a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/feature/collective-intelligence-grants/documenting-mass-human-rights-violations-through-collective-intelligence/">an initiative</a></span> that will soon mount a challenge in the UK court system is trialing a machine-learning alternative. It could model a way to make crowdsourced evidence more accessible and help human rights organizations tap into richer sources of information.</p><p>The initiative, led by Swansea University in the UK along with a number of human rights groups, is part of an ongoing effort to monitor the alleged war crimes happening in Yemen and create greater legal accountability around them. In 2017, the platform Yemeni Archive began compiling <span><a href="https://yemeniarchive.org/en/database">a database</a></span> of videos and photos documenting the abuses. Content was gathered from thousands of sources—including submissions from journalists and civilians, as well as open-source videos from social-media platforms like YouTube and Facebook—and preserved on a blockchain so they couldn’t be tampered with undetected.</p><p>Along with the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), a nonprofit that sues states for human rights violations, the investigators then began curating evidence of specific human rights violations into a <span><a href="https://www.glanlaw.org/airstrike-evidence-database-yemen">separate database</a></span> and mounting legal cases in various domestic and international courts. “If things are coming through courtroom accountability processes, it’s not enough to show that this happened,” says Yvonne McDermott Rees, a professor at Swansea University and the initiative’s lead. “You have to say, ‘Well, this is why it’s a war crime.’ That might be ‘You’ve used a weapon that’s illegal,’ or in the case of an air strike, ‘This targeted civilians’ or ‘This was a disproportionate attack.’”</p><p>In this case, the partners are focusing on a UK-manufactured cluster munition, the BLU-63. The use and sale of cluster munitions, explosive weapons that spray out smaller explosives on impact, are banned by 108 countries, including the UK. </p><p>So they decided to develop a machine-learning system to detect all instances of the BLU-63 in the database. But images of BLU-63s are rare precisely because they are illegal, which left the team with little real-world data to train their system. As a remedy, the team created a synthetic data set by reconstructing 3D models of the BLU-63 in a simulation.</p><p>While Harvey is still in the middle of generating more training examples—he estimates he will need over 2,000—the existing system already performs well: over 90% of the videos and photos it retrieves from the database have been verified by human experts to contain BLU-63s</p><p>Human experts would still need to verify the footage after the system filters it, but the gain in efficiency changes the game for human rights organizations looking to mount challenges in court. </p><p>“When you’re looking at, for example, the targeting of hospitals, having one video that shows a hospital being targeted is strong; it makes a case,” says Jeff Deutch, the lead researcher at Syrian Archive, who also launched Yemeni Archive. “But if you can show hundreds of videos of hundreds of incidents of hospitals being targeted, you can see that this is really a deliberate strategy of war. When things are seen as deliberate, it becomes more possible to identify intent. And intent might be something useful for legal cases in terms of accountability for war crimes.”</p><p>As the Yemen collaborators prepare to submit their case, evidence on this scale will be particularly relevant.

At regular petrol stations, the same amount would cost YR5,900.</p><p>On Thursday, 24 hospitals in seven provinces in Yemen issued a statement saying that they were running out of fuel supply.</p><p>Without fuel, the hospital cannot run generators necessary to keep surgical equipment and operating rooms going, putting thousands of lives at risk as a result, especially during a <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/coronavirus">coronavirus</a></span> pandemic, which the UN refugee agency <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-coronavirus-beggars-displaced-hunger">said</a></span> last month could push Yemen closer to a "potential breaking point".</p><p>The hospitals called on the United Nations and international non-governmental organisations to intervene and release the detained fuel ships.</p><p>The fuel shortage has also led to the doubling of water prices, as both water pumps and water trucks are now running less frequently. </p><p>Mohammed Ibrahim, a water truck driver, told MEE that he could no longer sell water at the same price as before, or else he would be unable to make ends meet.</p><p>Most residents depend on water trucks to supply them with clean water from wells in the outskirts of cities.</p><p>"I can summarise the increase of water prices in one sentence. If the fuel is expensive or hard to get it, everything else will be expensive and the situation will be bad," Ibrahim said, adding that he hoped the warring sides can reach an agreement to solve the fuel crisis in Houthi-controlled areas. </p><p>People bear the brunt</p><p>The Saudi-led coalition is trying to evade responsibility for detaining the fuel ships by sending fuel trailers in their place, said the general executive manager of the oil company in Sanaa, Amar al-Adhroei.</p><p>In a Facebook <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/srh.ypc/">post</a></span>, he explained why the Houthis have not allowed the 250 fuel trailers coming from Aden to enter areas under their control.</p><p>"Ninety-percent of the vehicles aren't fuel trucks but normal cars carrying tanks filled with fuel, and only 20 percent of the fuel meets specifications," Adhroei said.</p><p>He added that there are only 800,000 litres of fuel in the fuel trailers coming from Aden, much lower than the 10,200,000 litres required per day.</p><p>Adhroei insisted that the Saudi-led coalition is responsible for this crisis, as it is still preventing fuel ships from offloading in Hodeidah.</p><p>However, some Yemenis called the Houthi's reason for blocking the fuel trailers a "joke".</p><p>"We buy petrol from the black market, and usually this petrol is mixed with water and other materials. Does this meet their specifications? This is just a pretext by the Houthis to prevent the fuel trailers from entering, and then to create a fuel crisis so the world will feel sympathy for them," said Mohammed, a Sanaa resident.</p><p>"My message to the Houthis is to let the fuel trailers enter their areas without silly statements, and my message to the coalition is to lift the siege on Yemen and let ships offload fuel in Hodeidah," he said.</p><p>As for Haimi, the bus driver, politics don't mean much as long as he can get access to petrol.</p><p>"Petrol means work, and work means a good life. Without enough petrol our life will only get worse," he said.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-severe-fuel-shortage-houthi-areas">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-severe-fuel-shortage-houthi-areas</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen in Focus: Allies turn rivals on strategic Socotra island</strong></p><p><span>But </span><span><a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/6/22/saudi-coalition-announces-ceasefire-with-southern-separatists-in-yemen">escalating tensions</a></span><span> came to a boil last week when pro-STC forces seized all key government and military locations on </span><span><a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/6/24/saudi-coalition-deploys-ceasefire-observers-to-yemens-south">Socotra island</a></span><span>, declared self-administrative authority, and appointed its own acting governor.</span></p><p><span>The move, though carried out by a small number of fighters with little bloodshed, proved to be a significant turning point in the more than five-year conflict, prompting severe criticism of the Saudi-led coalition by government officials who accused it of "betrayal".</span></p><p><span>Shortly after, pro-Saudi media was ripe with reports of alleged Turkish-Qatari-Muslim Brotherhood activities in Yemen, noting the takeover had curbed the axis' "growing influence" on the island.</span></p><p><span>However, Yemen experts and political analysts have dismissed the claims as mere excuses by the coalition designed to sow discord.</span></p><p><span>"There's no Turkish presence in Socotra.

Meanwhile, Jalal believes it to be a strategy to push for stalled agreements. </span></p><p><span>"The actor that green-lighted the Abyan battle in May to pressure the UAE-backed STC tacitly approved the latter's takeover of Hadibo, Socotra, to pressure the government to renew talks on the stalled Riyadh Agreement," Jalal said, in comments that were recently solidified with an announced de-escalation meeting in Saudi Arabia between members of the bickering allies.</span></p><p><span>Yemen's cabinet demanded authorities on the ground launch reviews of regional and foreign organisations operating in Yemen that are </span><span><a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/6/22/saudi-intervention-failed-aide-to-yemeni-president-says">practicing political discord</a></span><span> under the cover of charity, the official SABA News Agency reported.</span></p><p><span>The cabinet confirmed the organisations under review are operating without licenses from relevant authorities, though it failed to name them.</span></p><p><span>However, a government source revealed to The New Arab's Arabic-language sister platform, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, that the list includes the UAE's Khalifa Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan Foundation, which has an office on the </span><span><a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/6/22/saudi-coalition-announces-ceasefire-with-southern-separatists-in-yemen">embattled Socotra island</a></span><span>.

There was security, safety and stability. Nowadays, everyone lives in fear. When I fall ill, I avoid going out to a health facility because the distance is far. In the past, if you wanted to visit your parents or family, it would take only an hour, but nowadays, you leave your house in the morning and arrive to your destination at dusk.</p><p>I gave birth to my child in the village, in a health centre. There, I was told my son requires medical attention, nutritional support. There are only medical clinics in our area, no hospitals available, so we drove for around 2 hours to arrive to this hospital. I have been in this hospital for four days now. Even a simple walk tires me. I am still recovering from the trip – it was very exhausting, especially for me being pregnant and with that difficult road condition."</p><p>Balqees, patient</p><p>"I have seen many mothers in this hospital, but there were two particular cases that remain in my mind to this day.</p><p>They were two mothers who passed away in our hospital. They had arrived from other centers where there was limited qualified medical staff there. There was a female staff - who it seems - was working as midwife but had little medical expertise. She helped in the delivery of two women, but unfortunately the women were bleeding a lot and she couldn’t control this bleeding, and both women arrived in our hospital in a state of shock, at the very last stage.</p><p>One of the caretakers was a 14-year old daughter, she was crying a lot, saying that if the distance had not been this long, she would not have lost her mother. It was very difficult to console the father and the little daughter at the same time, and what could you possible say to console them and take away that pain? It was a heartbreaking moment."</p><p>Taghreed, OT nurse</p><p>"The war has turned our lives upside down. From stability to displacement, and from tranquility to preparedness. What is it like to be prepared at all times to travel or to be displaced again at any point? It is a terrifying feeling. This feeling describes war. That is what I feel - that I have to be prepared to leave at any time; prepared my bag, prepared my documents, prepared my children as well. Because war may come again any time, and I would have to exit and leave everything behind me.

The international community will be sending a message that the lives of children in a nation devastated by conflict, disease and economic collapse, simply do not matter.”</p><p>The report warns that unless US$54.5 million is received for health and nutrition services by the end of August:</p><p>23,500 children with severe acute malnutrition will be at increased risk of dying;</p><p>Up to one million children will not receive vital micronutrient supplements and vitamin A, and 500,000 pregnant and breastfeeding mothers will miss out on essential nutrition support including counselling on infant and young child feeding, and folic acid and iron supplements;</p><p>Five million children under the age of five years will not be immunised against killer diseases; 19 million people will lose access to healthcare, including one million pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and their children;</p><p>The report also highlights that crucial water and sanitation services for three million children and their communities will begin to shut down from the end of July, unless US$45 million is secured.

They shouted at the migrants: Take your coronavirus and leave the country or face death.</p><p>Fatima Mohammed’s baby, Naa’if, was screaming. She grabbed him and ran behind her husband as bullets streaked overhead.</p><p>“The sound of the bullets was like thunder that wouldn’t stop,” said Kedir Jenni, 30, an Ethiopian waiter who also fled Al Ghar, near the Saudi border in northern Yemen, on that morning in early April. “Men and women get shot next to you. You see them die and move on.”</p><p>This scene and others were recounted in phone interviews with a half-dozen migrants now in Saudi prisons. Their accounts could not be independently verified, but human rights groups have corroborated similar episodes.</p><p>The Houthis, the Iran-backed militia that controls most of northern Yemen, have driven thousands of migrants out of their territory at gunpoint over the past three months, blaming them for spreading the coronavirus, and dumped them in the desert without food or water.</p><p>Others were forced to the border with Saudi Arabia, the Houthis’ primary foe, only to be shot at by Saudi border guards and detained in prisons where they were beaten, given little food and forced to sleep on the same floor that they use as a toilet, migrants said in interviews from prison. Some have returned to abusive smugglers, determined to cross the border to find jobs in oil-rich Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Humanitarian officials and researchers say the African migrant workers who traverse Yemen every year endure torture, rape, extortion, bombs and bullets in their desperation to get to Saudi Arabia. This spring, when the pandemic made them convenient scapegoats for Yemen’s troubles, they lost even that slender hope.</p><p>“COVID is just one tragedy inside so many other tragedies that these migrants are facing,” said Afrah Nasser, a Yemen researcher at Human Rights Watch.</p><p>More than 100,000 Ethiopians, Somalis and other East Africans board overstuffed smugglers’ boats across the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden to Yemen every year, according to the United Nations, hoping to make their way north to support their families with jobs as domestic servants, animal herders or laborers in the wealthy Gulf countries whose economies depend on migrants.</p><p>The journey is murderous at every stage</p><p>'Slaughter valleys'</p><p>UN surveys show that most migrants do not know about the fighting in Yemen before they arrive, but crossfire and coalition airstrikes find them anyway. At border crossings, Saudi guards shoot and kill them, littering what the migrants call “slaughter valleys” with bodies, migrants and humanitarian officials say. Those who survive are often detained by Saudi authorities and deported.</p><p>A Saudi official, who asked not to be named, said allegations of mistreatment of migrants who cross the border illegally are not true and would be an affront to Saudi values.</p><p>Since borders clamped shut during the pandemic, the flow of migrants to Yemen has nearly evaporated, plummeting from 18,904 in May 2019 to 1,195 this May, according to the UN But at least 14,500 remain in the country. Many arrived in years past and stayed to scrape together a living or save up before trying to go on to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>When the Houthis stormed into town in April, Jenni said, he fled in his flip-flops, shoving $1,300 — all his savings — into his underwear.</p><p>Some of the migrants who ran from Al Ghar toward Saudi Arabia on 8 April estimated that the Houthis shot and killed at least 250 migrants that day. Another migrant, Ali Mohammed, 28, who recounted being chased off a farm in nearby Al Haydan, said only 57 of the 200 Ethiopians with him survived.</p><p>At one point in April, humanitarian officials estimate, the Houthis left more than 20,000 migrants — mostly Ethiopians, many of them women — stranded in the “slaughter valleys” along the border.

These include all pregnant women, children, persons with disabilities, elderly persons, and those who are sick. The Group also recommends the release of low-risk offenders, detainees held on remand, and those nearing the end of their sentences, as well as others who can be safely reintegrated into society.</p><p>Recalling the Group's call made in its 2019 Report submitted to the Human Rights Council, Mr. Kamel Jendoubi, Chairperson of the Group, also said "all persons detained in a manner contrary to international human rights and humanitarian law should be released immediately, including members of the Baha'i community, and those subject to an order of release granted by judicial authorities, such as journalists". He also welcomed commitments made by authorities to further releases.</p><p>The Group of Experts is aware of the need for relevant authorities to consider public safety as well as security imperatives in their decision-making about the release of detainees. This has particular application to persons who have committed violent crimes, as well as the detention of persons whose activities pose a serious threat to the security of the detaining authority in relation to an armed conflict. However, it calls on all parties to take adequate measures, in line with international standards, to limit the risk of exposure to COVID-19 for those who remain in detention.</p><p>The Group of Experts stresses the importance of all parties to the conflict adopting measures, recognising the potentially catastrophic effect for persons in detention and the broader community if the virus were to spread further in Yemen, given the significant limitations of the Yemeni health system. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25994&amp;LangID=E">https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25994&amp;LangID=E</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Yemen WASH Cluster COVID-19 Bulletin, 16 June 2020 [EN/AR]</p><p>WASH is a key preventative measure in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and is one of the principal public health recommendations.</p><p>The severity of the current response to COVID-19 poses grave detrimental impacts on WASH service provision and sustainability if not adequately mitigated.

Internal documents obtained by The Associated Press shows that seawater has entered the engine compartment of the tanker, which hasn’t been maintained for over five years, causing damage to the pipelines and increasing the risk of sinking. Rust has covered parts of the tanker and the inert gas that prevents the tanks from gathering inflammable gases, has leaked out. Experts say maintenance is no longer possible because the damage to the ship is irreversible.</p><p>For years, the U.N. has been trying to send inspectors to assess the damage aboard the vessel known as the FSO Safer and look for ways to secure the tanker by unloading the oil and pulling the ship to safety.</p><p>But one European diplomat, a Yemeni government official and the tanker’s company owner said that Houthi rebels have resisted. The diplomat said the rebels are treating the vessel as a “deterrent like having a nuclear weapon.” All three individuals spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.</p><p>“They do say that openly to the U.N., ‘We like to have this as something to hold against the international community if attacked,’” the diplomat said. “Houthis are definitely responsible for failure of the U.N. to look at the ship.”</p><p>Money is also an issue, the diplomat said, adding that the Houthis initially were demanding millions of dollars in return for the oil stored in the tanker. The U.N. is trying to reach an arrangement where money could be used to pay workers and employees at Yemen’s Red Sea ports, the diplomat added.</p><p><span><a href="https://apnews.com/e8d9e1a1d674a2d6784a2c53dfe628e2">https://apnews.com/e8d9e1a1d674a2d6784a2c53dfe628e2</a></span></p><p><span>Photos: </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/RepYemenEnglish/status/1276512499756654598">https://twitter.com/RepYemenEnglish/status/1276512499756654598</a></span></p><p>My comment: The last paragraph quoted here is crucial, both Yemeni governments claim the profit of selling this crude, this blocks all everything.

Peace in Yemen does not need detailing according to what your countries want, nor can it come from seminars and conferences with non-actors from the Yemeni Republic and the party of aggressors as countries.”</p><p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=13668">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=13668</a></span></p><p><span>and also </span><span><a href="https://debriefer.net/en/news-18063.html">https://debriefer.net/en/news-18063.html</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H P)</span></p><p>Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, but we can help</p><p>“USAID basically has decided to make a political point,” Scott Paul, humanitarian policy lead for <span><a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/">Oxfam</a></span>, says. “They want to demonstrate to the Houthis that no one should get in the way of, or intrude, or interfere in the work of humanitarian agencies. So they basically just cut off almost all of the assistance going to the north.”</p><p>Paul says that while both parties in the conflict have attempted to place “unacceptable” control over the delivery of humanitarian assistance, the move by USAID, the US’s international aid and development agency, has “given other parties the moral high ground to say it’s the US starving people for a political agenda and not them.”</p><p>He later adds that he thinks “there’s some truth to that. USAID is putting some of the world’s most vulnerable and at-risk people in the middle of a dispute, rather than trying to help where we can.”</p><p>Today, funding levels are plummeting when they’re needed more than ever.</p><p>“This is a complex and multifaceted conflict,” Paul says. “There is no good side and bad side, and if we’re serious about demonstrating the credibility to be a peace broker, to solve the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, we can’t be an arms broker to one side.”</p><p>US citizens should also voice their desire to see the US to lift the suspension of aid to Yemen.</p><p>“We are in a moment that requires truly global solidarity,” Paul says. “COVID is not affecting people just in one country. It’s affecting people everywhere.

They even came up with a new bipartisan bill in the US Senate attempting to force an end to US involvement in the Saudi war, because they say the war was never authorized by Congress.</p><p>Despite international outrage over the illegality of the unnecessary conflict and the unsubstantiated claims of Iranian involvement, some US officials claim the legal pretext for the war is that the US has sold Saudi Arabia all the warplanes and promised to “service” those planes, which in and of itself means refueling the planes during combat operations and airstrikes against civilian objects, including residential areas, hospitals and schools, factories, UNESCO World heritage sights, orphanages and wedding parties.</p><p>At bottom, there is no authorization for the war, not even a United Nations mandate, which clearly makes the US government, due to a host of reliable data and official statements, complicit in Saudi war crimes and crimes committed against humanity in the poorest country in the Arab world.</p><p>Western governments approving the export of arms to Saudi Arabia have received many detailed and credible reports from the UN and other reputable bodies over the past years pointing to a pattern of horrific human rights abuses and war crimes committed throughout Yemen by the Saudi forces and allies.</p><p>According to Amnesty International, “In the face of unbearable suffering of civilians and mounting casualties those governments are still carrying on business as usual, even escalating arms transfers. This is a clear breach of the golden rules in the Arms Trade Treaty.”</p><p>In the face of unbearable suffering of civilians amid the coronavirus pandemic and mounting illnesses, Western governments have failed to enact convincing measures to prevent further violations, conduct independent and impartial investigations, or bring the perpetrators to justice.</p><p>According to many human rights groups and international aid organizations, including the UN Human Rights Watch and OXFAM, Western governments, instead, are carrying on business as usual, and in some cases even escalating arms transfers - instead of sending medicines like test kits and protective gear.</p><p>This is a clear breach of the golden rules in the Arms Trade Treaty, International Law, International Humanitarian law, and the UN Charter. Under the same laws and treaties, all Western governments must immediately halt their deadly arms transfers and military support to Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners that are being used to commit and facilitate serious violations of International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law in Yemen.</p><p>Washington and its NATO allies know that it’s because they have turned a blind eye that Saudi Arabia continues to bomb Yemen.

The brutal realities of the war are reflected in the internet and telecommunications infrastructure. It has become a battleground for exerting control, with authorities connecting or disconnecting the population to serve a military objective. As a result, millions of Yemenis have been deprived of their right to communicate, to access and exchange information, and importantly, to share their reality and lived experiences. This further exacerbates the depravity of their conditions. </p><p>Internet shutdowns and censorship</p><p>According to the 2019 <span><a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2020/02/KeepItOn-2019-report-1.pdf">#KeepItOn report</a></span>, Yemen accounted for the majority of internet shutdowns in the Middle East region. In addition, there were reports from multiple trusted sources that the true number of internet shutdowns in Yemen is far higher than originally documented.</p><p>Today, countless Yemenis remain in the dark, suffering under a network blackout during the ongoing conflict in the middle of a global pandemic.</p><p>January of 2020 began an especially dark period. Early in the month, damage to a submarine fiber optic cable <span><a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/houthis-cut-off-internet-to-80-per-cent-of-yemen-1.747535">cut 80 percent of internet capacity</a></span> in Yemen. Many sources attribute the damage to sabotage by the Houthis, but regardless of who or what is responsible, Yemenis were effectively cut off from one another and the rest of the world. The continued disconnections have become increasingly dangerous with the continued spread of COVID-19.</p><p>Battle for control of internet services, steep price hikes deepen the connectivity crisis</p><p>In 2011, when protests started in Yemen, the ownership of telecommunication services and companies became a political issue. With the ongoing civil unrest and random bombings in the country, power outages, and alleged deliberate sabotage of fiber optic equipment, telecommunication providers are struggling to maintain services. </p><p>In 2015, the Houthis <span><a href="https://smex.org/internet-shutdown-in-yemen-recurring-disruptions-threaten-civilian-safety-human-rights-and-press-freedom/">took over</a></span> the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology and began to filter and censor various news sites, and eventually, to shut down the internet completely, multiple times.</p><p>Earlier this year, the government-held telecommunications company, YemenNet, surprised the rest of Yemen’s telcos by <span><a href="https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/yemen-internet-conflict/">sharply increasing</a></span> the price of internet prices and imposing new data limits.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton-as-yemens-war-goes-online-internet-shutdowns-and-censorship-are-hurting-yemenis/">https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton-as-yemens-war-goes-online-internet-shutdowns-and-censorship-are-hurting-yemenis/</a></span></p><p><span>(?

More than $3bn (£2.4bn), and that enabled us to feed 13 million people a month. Now the money has fallen away."</p><p>The numbers, collated by the UN children's agency (UNICEF), are overwhelming.</p><p>Four in five Yemeni children, 12.3 million, are in desperate need of aid. More than 1.7 million children have been forced to flee their homes to camps, which are themselves now at threat of closure because of a cut in funding.</p><p>Some 10.2 million children do not have access to basic healthcare. And over the course of the civil war, drug-preventable diseases like diphtheria, cholera, measles and malaria - are all rife.</p><p>"Of course the real solution to the tragic problems we see now in Yemen is peace. The men with guns and bombs need to put the guns and bombs down and get round table and move forward in a peace process," Sir Mark said.</p><p>"It's a stark choice.

For two weeks now, residents of the main city of Sana’a have witnessed kilometre-long queues for petrol. The price of petrol on the black market has shot up. Some gas stations have already run dry.</p><p>Five years of war has left Yemen without a functioning electricity grid. This makes fuel such as diesel the main source of power for many vital services, like pumping water through city pipes or running ventilators in hospitals. Fuel is also what makes it possible to transport food and water to communities in acute need.</p><p>A shortage is potentially deadly, as we witnessed during <span><a href="https://www.nrc.no/news/2019/october/new-fuel-crisis-deepens-suffering-for-hungry-yemenis/">the similar crisis last year</a></span>.

His family are among 2,500 displaced people in Al-Khudaish camp who have fled the frontlines of the war and are now living in tents made from wood and tarpaulin. With the funding for fuel gone, every family in the camp must now survive on just 10 litres of water every two days.</p><p>“Should we use the 10 litres for drinking,” Abdu asks, “for washing hands to protect ourselves from the coronavirus, for washing our clothes, or for cooking?”</p><p>An impossible water situation</p><p>The impossibility of this situation has forced Abdu and other families to beg for water. There is no nearby well, and no other options. “The only source is the tanks [in the camp],” Abdu says. “I haven’t witnessed a shortage like this since I arrived here a year and half ago.”</p><p>It is not just Abdu’s camp which is affected, but his entire district of Abs. The water network there is down to just half its usual capacity – which is all the solar-powered part of the system can provide, and even that requires some fuel to run.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2020/looming-fuel-crisis-is-threatening-food-hospitals-and-water/">https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2020/looming-fuel-crisis-is-threatening-food-hospitals-and-water/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span>KINDHEIT IM JEMEN</span></p><p><span>Zwischen Krieg, Cholera und Covid-19</span></p><p><span>Aufwachsen im Jemen: Kindheit in der Katastrophe</span></p><p><span>Das Gesundheitssystem steht vor dem Kollaps und ist nun mit der Corona-Pandemie völlig überfordert.

Here he reflects with Samuel Getachew of The Reporter on the many contributions of the United Nations agency, on helping the flow of migrants headed to Ethiopia from Gulf nations these days and on how COVID-19 has affected some of its activities. Excerpt:</p><p>Yemen is part of the route through which migrants from the Horn of Africa – primarily Ethiopia and Somalia – head to the Gulf nations. There are several categories of people, including irregular migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.</p><p>In 2019, over 138,000 migrants arrived in Yemen from the Horn of Africa. However, in the first half of this year, there has been a major decrease in arrivals due to COVID-19 movement restrictions. Tighter border controls in arrival and departure points from the Horn of Africa has meant that migrant arrivals into Yemen are drastically low. Migrant arrivals were down by 94 per cent in May 2020 when compared to arrival trends during the same period in 2019. </p><p>But IOM is still concerned and there are inherent dangers for migrants. Migrants and similar vulnerable groups find themselves trapped at frontlines of Yemen’s conflict. They can be exposed to many forms of abuse, including injuries from sitting in cramped conditions and overcrowded boats. Physical abuse and torture, sexual exploitation, as well as death by drowning or starving due to boats taking on water, being adrift for days or capsizing. Forced disembarkation before reaching the shore, abductions for ransom, arrest and detention in inhumane conditions, forced labour and trafficking.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/working-protecting-human-rights-migrants">https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/working-protecting-human-rights-migrants</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Yemen: UNHCR Operational Update, 25 June 2020</p><p>Despite limited funding, difficulties with humanitarian access, ongoing clashes and the devastating onset of COVID-19, UNHCR continues to deliver life-saving interventions across Yemen.

The new regulations impose a “khumus” or “one-fifth” levy in one of the chapters, stating the revenues are to be distributed to those belonging to “Bani Hashem” and their poor. The implementing regulations, which aim to institutionalize resource distribution based on descent, are in flagrant violation of international treaties and conventions, the Yemeni Constitution and fundamental human rights principles and justice values.</p><p>On April 29, 2020, Mahdi Al Mashat, President of Ansar Allah’s Supreme Political Council, which controls the capital, Sana’a, and other Yemeni provinces, issued Decree No. 48 of 2020. The decree promulgated implementing regulations to the Yemeni Zakat Law No. 2 of 1999, passed by the Yemeni parliament 21 years before the current conflict. Articles 47 and 48 of the new implementing regulations impose a levy of 20% (known as “khumus”) on natural resources and minerals. According to the regulations, this levy is applicable to items such as minerals, gas, gold, silver, copper, lime, water, stones, salt, sand, marble, fish, pearl, amber and honey.</p><p>Article 48 of the new regulations prescribes how these revenues are to be distributed. According to the regulations, the collected “khumus” revenues are meant to be distributed according to six categories. Four of the six categories explicitly use the term “Bani Hashem,” referring to a group of Yemenis that link their descent to the Prophet Mohammed, and of which the leader of Ansar Allah is a member. According to the first two categories listed in the regulations, Khumus revenues must be used for the public benefit of Muslims, but including in this definition military spending on “soldiers” and “weaponry,” and be allocated to the Wali Al-Amr, or guardian. Next, the regulations state that funds should be distributed to “Bani Hashem” and their poor. Then, in the final three categories, the regulations stipulate that Khumus funds must be spent on orphans, the poor and destitute travelers, referring on each occasion to those from Bani Hashem.</p><p>“With these discriminatory articles, the implementing regulations to the Zakat law segregate Yemenis on the basis of descent,” said Radhya Al Mutawakel, Chairperson of Mwatana for Human Rights. “These regulations, passed during exceptional circumstances when the natural legislative authority is absent due to the conflict, mark a dangerous precedent perpetuating discrimination and further tearing the already war-torn Yemeni social fabric.”</p><p>“The recent discriminatory Ansar Allah decree that aims at extracting more funds from Yemenis, and allocating these funds to a certain group on the basis of their descent, is rejected and condemned, and must be rescinded immediately. This decree comes at a time when the economic and humanitarian situation in the country is deteriorating, and as hundreds of thousands of civil servants are not being paid.
