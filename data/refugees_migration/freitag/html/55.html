Regardless of their goodwill.</p><p>In 2018, the UN <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/raises-26bn-donations-yemen-humanitarian-aid-190226161139569.html">praised international donors</a></span> for raising large amounts of money to tackle Yemen’s humanitarian crisis. Almost all of the $3 billion pledged has been either received by the UN or formally committed. In 2017, when the first pledging conference for Yemen was held, 94 percent of the pledges, $1.1 billion, was fulfilled, according to the UN.</p><p>However, this year, the United Nations <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/26/more-than-half-of-26bn-aid-to-yemen-pledged-by-countries-involved-in-war">announced</a></span> that humanitarian needs in Yemen for this year amount to $2.96 billion, $2.1 billion of which has already been collected, while other countries pledged the remaining amount. </p><p>Where does the aid money go?</p><p>The United Nations annually declares and approves a public response plan involving local authorities including Yemen’s National Authority for the Management and Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Recovery (NAMCHA). </p><p>By investigating official documents of the annual public response and its actual outcomes, as well as tracking the flow of millions of dollars of supplies and funds from aid programs, it becomes apparent that most donor funds go to the coffers of UN relief organizations and international and local NGOs. In other words, more than seventy percent of the aid is stolen off the top.</p><p>That money is distributed to dozens of UN agencies, international organizations and local NGOs. The largest recipients include the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the World Health Organization, and the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.</p><p>According to budget lists in the UN’s annual public response, 15-20 percent of grants are taken in the form of dues before they reach Yemenis. Then, an additional 45-60 percent of the grants go to relief organizations to cover operating and support expenses.</p><p>Moreover, a review of the UN budget shows that grant money allocated to Yemen has been wasted on projects that are not a part of the UN’s annual public response plan. That money is supposed to go towards serving the needs of Yemenis based on research by civil society organizations and local authorities.</p><p>At a time when hundreds of residents, mostly women and children, die every day due to shortages of food and medicine, millions of dollars are being funneled into reproductive health projects such as the International Child Welfare Organization’s reproductive health project with a budget of $4,592,632 to distribute contraceptives and educational sex dolls.</p><p>The Yemeni minister of public health and population, Taha al-Mutawakel called on the United Nations and humanitarian organizations to clarify the fate of funds allocated to Yemen. Al-Mutawakel bemoaned how aid money has been squandered on cars and services instead of alleviating the sufferings of Yemenis. “Stop shedding tears for our children who get killed, whilst there is no credibility whatsoever in your international reports and they do not help assuage this tragic situation, he said from inside the Sabeen Maternal Hospital in the capital Sana’a.</p><p>“We are not demanding toys and video game consoles, but we are calling for incubators and other related devices to give children the right to life.”</p><p>Relief agency corruption trickles down to Yemen’s locals</p><p>Further analysis of public documents shows that a portion of aid money goes to the accounts of UN relief organizations via its procurement policy. Those organizations often allot excessive amounts of money to buy imported products, yet often end up buying those products from local markets or from abroad at lower prices than specified in their detailed humanitarian plan.</p><p>For example, in 2019, the World Food Program (WFP) budget included money to purchase 70 million liters of diesel at 92 cents per liter, for a total cost of $64.5 million. However, the domestic market price for diesel in just 75 cents per liter and the organization buys the diesel from Yemen Oil Company at the local price according to official agreements which have been reviewed by MintPress. That disparity means that a staggering $21,700,000 will end up in WFP coffers.</p><p>Relief organizations that have diverted donated food, medicine, fuel and money from desperate Yemenis amid their country’s five-year war also receive significant financial benefits by leveraging currency exchange rates. The procurement process and projects carried out by many of these organizations are paid for in local currency, not in U.S. dollars. In this way, organizations save substantial sums of money by engaging in a sort of currency speculation.</p><p>In addition, organizations workers have been caught selling relief items to local merchants who then trade them on the black market. Two merchants, as well as eyewitnesses, confirmed to MintPress that they were sold relief items bearing the WFP’s logo by the organization’s workers. Some residents engage in the sale of these items out of desperation and the need for money for medical treatment or to pay rent according to residents who spoke to MintPress.</p><p>Moreover, the scant food aid which millions of Yemenis rely on for their daily sustenance often doesn’t reach people until it is already expired, by that time often crawling with worms and cockroaches because of lack of proper storage facilities, constant power outages, or long hours in transport. Rotten food aid is sometimes burned as it is not fit for human consumption. To make matters worse, coalition forces have bombed bridges linking Yemen’s main port in Hodeida with Sana’a, the capital city, which has meant trucks loaded with vital supplies have to take other routes adding many hours to the journey.</p><p>Current conditions on the ground are seriously hindering the delivery and distribution of aid as the Saudi-led coalition is enforcing a commercial blockade on sea and air routes into the country, and placing restrictions on relief supplies where aid is subject to long inspection delays and in some cases, rejected altogether. The fate of the rejected aid is not known.</p><p>Inflated salaries and internal waste</p><p>The simultaneous funding of war and aid</p><p>Corruption undermines the trust of civilians and donors – by Ahmed Abdulkareem</p><p><span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/billions-donor-funds-yemen-fill-coffers-international-aid-agencies/263163/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/billions-donor-funds-yemen-fill-coffers-international-aid-agencies/263163/</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Organizations Making Business, and Non-Humanitarian International Assistance !!</strong></p><p>Copy of an investigation in English disclosing the corruption of international organizations working in Yemen, which was published by Al-Thawra Newspaper in Arabic on December 3, 2019.</p><p>A Complete File Supported with Documents Detecting International Organizations Corruption:</p><p>Documents disclose financial, administrative, practical and moral corruption of those who disbursed grants to Yemen</p><p>The documents disclose wasting big funds as humanitarian assistance to Yemen</p><p>WFP allocated 330 billion YER for distribution, supervision and survey; 44 billion YER for transportation during the year 2019</p><p>Despite the UN organizations work in Yemen since the beginning of aggression, but poverty rate increased to 85% and unemployment rate reached 65%</p><p>Some International Organizations seize the opportunity while humanitarian work to carry out projects which actually serve aggression forces as soft and psychological warfare, utilizing citizens suffering</p><p>Illegal abuses of International Organizations while submitting their required reports</p><p>Changing food relief into financial aid is a step to reduce organizations' excesses and financial corruption</p><p>Organizations attract foreign experts with high paid despite the existence of qualified local cadres</p><p>Reports indicate that Organizations have allocated, to their Headquarters and regional offices abroad a big portion of humanitarian assistance, spending about 60% of these assistance on organizations operational expenditures, furniture and support; allocate huge sums, irrationally, to implementers for relief distributions processes, surveys required, direct and indirect support.</p><p>On same regard, the World Food Program (WFP) has allocated $ 599 million (330 billion YER), distribution, supervision and survey costs for the year 2019, in addition to $ 80 million (44 billion YER) was allocated for transportation.</p><p>Experts</p><p>In addition, on same time that Yemen has qualified cadres who can do their jobs in best possible way, with a suitable salary, however these organizations attract foreign experts with high amounts, despite the futility of their existence. On same regard, a memo of the United Nations, which Al-Thawra earlier received, has disclosed that 8 employees affiliated to one of UN International organizations working in Yemen received about $ 50 million (30 billion YER) as salaries for only 11 months. Meanwhile, according to reports, it was revealed that the Director of the WHO office, Nivio Zagaria in Yemen, during the period between 2016 - September 2018, was hired unqualified Filipino staff, already worked for him in Philippine, and appointed them to high-paying positions, two of them were assigned only to take care of the dog of the Director.</p><p>The UN organization pays a big amount of money to secure its staff housing, in addition to other premiums as a risk allowance, regardless the costs of delivering aid to conflict areas, in which the United Nations said that costs are very high, considering that Yemen is a dangerous and probably poses threats to them.

It is no surprise to see deadlines slip," Elisabeth Kendall, Yemen expert and senior research fellow at Oxford University, told AFP.</p><p>"The bigger question is: are the promises simply being delayed, or are they ultimately not achievable?"</p><p>The two sides say they are committed to the Riyadh Agreement but have traded accusations over who is responsible for the failure to meet the deadline to form a new government.</p><p>STC spokesman Nizar Haitham said on Thursday that Yemen's government was "deviating" from the agreement and mobilising its troops in the south, an accusation the government denied.</p><p>However in recent days an STC official told AFP that work to implement the Riyadh Agreement was ongoing and that there has been "significant progress" in implementing military and security arrangements.</p><p>"Starting next week, we'll begin steps in implementing what was agreed on," this source said in a written statement without elaborating.</p><p>According to government spokesman Rajih Badi, the secessionists are the ones failing to abide by the treaty.</p><p>He said that government military movements in the south are in line with the Riyadh Agreement and in coordination with the Saudi coalition, which continues to lead the anti-Huthi camp comprised of both government and secessionist forces.</p><p>But although clashes in the south have largely subsided, the situation on the ground remains fragile, said Kendall.</p><p>"This is a classic case of an agreement being easy to sign but near impossible to implement," she said.</p><p>Other parts of the deal, including placing forces from both sides under the authority of the defence and interior ministries, have also not been fulfilled.</p><p>The lack of concrete progress since the deal was signed comes as a blow to those hailing it as a stepping stone towards ending the wider conflict, described by the UN as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.</p><p>"The Riyadh Agreement erected a whole set of deadlines that, for starters, rely on very different Yemeni parties being wholly sincere in wanting and being able to share power in Aden," Neil Partrick, a London-based Middle East analyst, told AFP.</p><p>"It's hugely ambitious just to hope to get a power-sharing deal to meaningfully hold up in Aden," he continued.</p><p>"But to see this as a basis for the sharing of power throughout the south and for then taking on the Huthis in the north, is possibly not even that serious."</p><p>Mohammed Bawzeer, an Aden resident, told AFP there was an overwhelming feeling of disappointment in the city.</p><p>"Deadlines have passed, and there is no change on the ground," he said.

Long seen as the cultural heart of the country, Taiz emerged in early 2015 as the center of what many observers describe as a proxy war between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis, an armed Zaidi Shia revivalist movement with ties to Iran.</p><p>The current military situation in Taiz is a stalemate between the Houthis and a diverse, loosely formed coalition of anti-Houthi groups. Having surrounded and besieged the city of Taiz, the Houthis remain in control of most of its entrances and exits, controlling the passage of goods and people along with a strategically critical north-south gateway. The conflict in Taiz is emblematic of the way regional rivalries between Gulf States and Iran and hyperlocal competition for power and influence have played out and intersected across Yemen.</p><p>Foreign powers play an important role in the conflict by seeking to impose their own goals through sponsorship of armed factions and political groups. As a strategic location abutting Saudi Arabia’s southern border and the shipping lanes of the Red Sea, Yemen holds importance for several foreign powers’ regional agendas. This has led many commentators to analyze the conflict through the lens of proxy warfare.</p><p>Yet this lens can easily misrepresent the war as one in which Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and Iran move their proxies like chess pieces seeking comparative advantage, while also reducing the war as a whole to these movements. It is not only a matter of misdiagnosing the dynamics involved; framing the conflict as primarily a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia complicates efforts to resolve the conflict. The framing provides strategic advantages for many of the belligerent parties who use it to fuel their war efforts. The narrative itself further internationalizes the conflict, obscuring the essential nature of the war in Yemen, which is at heart an internal Yemeni political conflict.</p><p>The internationalization of what was originally a domestic political struggle has made the conflict more complex, in turn making it more difficult to resolve, but it has not fundamentally altered the goals of the original domestic combatants. If the war is ever to end, the goals of Yemenis must be recognized for what they are, and elevated in importance above those of the international parties to the conflict.</p><p>Key Findings:</p><p>Various military forces in Yemen use the proxy war frame as a propaganda tool to recruit and raise funds, but the day-to-day experience of the conflict is highly local. In many cases, rather than a top-down proxy relationship of control, local forces exercise substantial agency despite receiving sponsorship, pursuing their own interests and using foreign sponsorship opportunities for their own purposes.</p><p>The complex web of forces and sponsorship opportunities has empowered individuals—in addition to groups—to act as major players in Yemen’s war. Abu al-Abbas, the leader of the Abu al-Abbas Brigades, for example, skillfully drew on Saudi, Emirati, local, and potentially al-Qaida support to drive his rise in influence.</p><p>Though the Houthis have increasingly aligned with Iran, they continue to enmesh themselves in Yemen’s wider body politic. Prior to the current war, the Houthis waged six wars against the Yemeni government in the twenty-first century, during which there is little evidence of firm Iranian command and control. Iran’s reported provision of missiles and drones shapes the conflict, but its roots are local and would not disappear were Iran to fully abandon the Houthis.</p><p>Foreign powers’ development of proxy relationships in the form of external sponsorship has made the conflict more complex and difficult to resolve via negotiations. Such foreign relationships have resulted in an interplay between an expanded and shifting set of local forces, national political factions, and international parties, each of which have their own interests and aims. This expanded set of armed and political groups fuels tensions and complicates efforts to end the violence through a negotiated settlement.</p><p>Uncritical adoption of the proxy war narrative poses challenges for peacemakers and policymakers, increasing the risks of escalation and frustrating efforts at conflict resolution. The narrative obscures the true localized nature of the conflict and ignores the goals and ambitions of key domestic stakeholders.</p><p>These wider divisions have dragged out the battle against the Houthis while providing growth opportunities to extremist groups like al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Al-Qaida’s strength has diminished recently and its power should not be exaggerated, but the group stands to benefit from persistent conflict – by Adam Baron and Raiman Al-Hamdani</p><p><span><a href="https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/reports/the-proxy-war-prism-on-yemen/">https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/reports/the-proxy-war-prism-on-yemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>A Caretaker President Clings to Legitimacy in Yemen</strong></p><p>Back in 2012, during a moment of national and regional consensus, the reserved, nonthreatening Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi was chosen as a temporary president. But Hadi, now seventy-four years old, has held onto power ever since, despite lacking a large base of domestic loyalists. Most important for the Yemeni people, the war needs to end with either a transitional council or elections so that a future leader enjoys the popular legitimacy Hadi lacks.</p><p>Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi was selected as a temporary president during a moment of national and regional consensus in 2012, following the protracted Arab Spring crisis in Yemen that led to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh’s departure from power. Hadi has remained president well past his expected two-year term, overseeing a war with the Houthi rebel group primarily in the north and a conflict with secessionists in the south. This study examines what might happen when he departs the scene.</p><p>Given the role the current government has played in the war, a change at the top will almost certainly be necessary either in the transitional process or through a post-transition election. The current president’s legitimacy derives from a UN- and Gulf Cooperation Counci–agreed framework, not from the loyalty of followers or control of a unified military. Moreover, Hadi is in the somewhat paradoxical position of being a southerner leading a government that faces a renewed secessionist movement among southerners, further confusing his legitimacy in the public’s eyes</p><p>Underpinning Hadi’s legitimacy—unusually, by name—are the GCC initiative of 2011, its implementation mechanism, and UN Security Council Resolution 2216 (2015).4 According to the GCC initiative, which followed Saleh’s resignation, the parties in Yemen committed “not to nominate or endorse any candidate for the early presidential elections except for the consensus candidate Vice-President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi.”5 Hadi was meant to serve as a transitional president who would oversee the National Dialogue Process, the writing of a new constitution, and the restructuring of the military, then oversee elections that would almost certainly unseat him. This process, however, was interrupted in September 2014 by the Houthi march into Sana and the rebel group’s eventual takeover of the state in early 2015</p><p>By March 2015, when the civil war began, Hadi had been serving for three years, a year longer than anticipated in the GCC initiative. Those who had supported extending his term beyond the two years had based their view on a reading of the initiative that bound the timeframe to tasks rather than a set period. The initiative did not spell out what would happen if the process to elections lasted longer than two years, so it was on this basis that Hadi remained president when the Houthis occupied Sana.</p><p>As a result of this unusual situation, some Yemenis contest Hadi’s legal legitimacy altogether. They point out that he was only supposed to be president for two years—until February 2014—and that his extension was without either an election or a negotiated settlement. Even those who accept the one-year extension point out that his term should have ended in February 2015, a month before the start of the current war.</p><p>Hadi is thus a president without a constituency and without the levers of a state, yet his embodiment as the Legitimacy has provided Saudi Arabia’s justification for carrying out the war.</p><p>There are two general ways a transition to the next leader of Yemen could occur: first, through a domestic and internationally agreed-upon process, perhaps as part of a peace deal to end the war, or second, as an involuntary rupture through death, a serious health matter, or forced removal—all of which might precipitate a constitutional crisis.</p><p>Whatever the transitional phase looks like—and whatever Hadi’s role in it—the main parties to the conflict agree notionally that a transitional government would be replaced through an election process, likely one or two years after the start of a peace agreement.</p><p>A constitutional crisis or the rise of a controversial figure like Ali Mohsen to the presidency might reorient the chess pieces in Yemen, providing either an opportunity for alternative solutions to the war or prompting further entrenchment. In the former case, an unpopular Ali Mohsen presidency might spur common cause among his adversaries for moving into a postwar transitional council with a more palatable figure at the helm – by <span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/experts/view/elana-delozier">Elana DeLozier</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/a-caretaker-prime-minister-clings-to-legitimacy-in-yemen">https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/a-caretaker-prime-minister-clings-to-legitimacy-in-yemen</a></span></p><p>and full document:</p><p><span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyNote73-DeLozier-v3.pdf">https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyNote73-DeLozier-v3.pdf</a></span></p><p><span>My comment: "Those who had supported extending his term beyond the two years had based their view on a reading of the initiative that bound the timeframe to tasks rather than a set period.

In December 2018, he was about to complete a big exchange, but the signing of the Swedish agreement hindered his efforts, and the parties refrained from responding to him on the pretext of their commitment to the agreement. "It was seven months until we were able to resume facilitating exchanges," he said.</p><p>The Stockholm agreement, signed Dec. 13, 2018, provided for "the release of prisoners and abductees from all parties." Subsequent meetings were held to discuss how to carry out the swap in Amman, Jordan, during which lists were exchanged identifying some 15,000 prisoners. But the process has been repeatedly stalled.</p><p>“We were optimistic about the Stockholm agreement, and we offered our services as local mediators to help implement the transfer of prisoners and abductees and facilitate the logistics,” he said. “But unfortunately, the UN did not exert sufficient effort and pressure to make this important item of the Swedish deal a success.”</p><p>Murait believes the reason for the failure of the prisoner file is that Griffiths has not prioritized it, focusing instead on the issue of Hodeidah, the strategic Red Sea port city where an impending battle between Saudi-led coalition-backed and Houthis last year threatened to compound the humanitarian crisis. “The abductees’ file is much less complex than the Hodeidah file,” Murait said, “but they are not interested.”</p><p>Murait said the UN envoy’s team has never contacted him and he has never received any request for assistance from any UN organization, despite his record of releasing 2,500 prisoners on his own accord.</p><p>"(The UN) have strong and effective means, but they are not like us tribes,” he said. “We have nothing but a serious effort to alleviate the suffering of thousands of families," he said.</p><p>The successes of Murait and other local mediators working on the file reflect the influence of local mediation in Yemeni society.</p><p>"The United Nations should study the methods of local tribes and mediators and learn from them," Murait said. “If warring parties resort to us and sign an agreement, we do all we can to enforce its implementation–the UN should do the same to respect the agreements it signs.”</p><p><span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/160">https://al-masdaronline.net/national/160</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>An End to Magical Thinking in the Middle East</strong></p><p>It’s time to abandon the dogma that’s driven our foreign policy and led to so much disaster in the region.</p><p>We have to come to grips with the deeper and more consequential betrayal of common sense—the notion that the only antidote to Trump’s fumbling attempts to disentangle the United States from the region is a retreat to the magical thinking that has animated so much of America’s moment in the Middle East since the end of the Cold War.</p><p>I served as a career diplomat throughout most of this era, sharing in our successes as well as our failures. Despite important achievements, we all too often misread regional currents and mismatched ends and means. In our episodic missionary zeal, especially after the terrible jolt to our system on 9/11, we tended to overreach militarily and underinvest diplomatically. We let our ambitions outstrip the practical possibilities of a region where perfect is rarely on the menu, and second- and third-order consequences are rarely uplifting. The temptations of magical thinking, the persistent tendency to assume too much about our influence and too little about the obstacles in our path and the agency of other actors, led to indiscipline and disappointments—steadily diminishing the appetite of most Americans for Middle East adventures.</p><p>That leaves American policy at a crossroads. Our moment as the singular dominant outside player in the Middle East has faded, but we still have a solid hand to play. The key to playing it well will be neither restoration of the inflated ambition and over-militarization of much of the post-9/11 period nor sweeping disengagement. Instead, we need a significant shift in the terms of our engagement in the region—lowering our expectations for transformation, ending our habit of indulging the worst instincts of our partners and engaging in cosmic confrontation with state adversaries, finding a more focused and sustainable approach to counterterrorism, and putting more emphasis on diplomacy backed up by military leverage, instead of the other way around.</p><p>[…]</p><p>Second, we need to recalibrate our relationships across the region in order to contribute to some long-term semblance of order. With Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arabs, that means much more of a two-way street. We ought to support them against legitimate external security threats, from Iran or anyone else, and back serious political and economic modernization. They need to stop acting as if they’re entitled to a blank check from us, end the catastrophic war in Yemen, stop meddling in political transitions in places such as Libya and Sudan, and manage their internal rivalries. And we need to find a way back to an updated nuclear deal with Iran. </p><p>I f we can recover the sense of discipline and limits that animated the diplomacy of George H. W. Bush and Baker, if not the geopolitical weight of their America, there is no reason we can’t navigate a very different moment in the Middle East without massive setbacks, and maybe even with occasional successes.

Five years after leaving government, he shopped the same idea to an enthusiastic partner: an Arab monarchy with deep pockets.</p><p>In 2008, Clarke went to work as a consultant guiding the United Arab Emirates as it created a cyber surveillance capability that would utilize top American intelligence contractors to help monitor threats against the tiny nation.</p><p>The secret unit Clarke helped create had an ominous acronym: DREAD, short for Development Research Exploitation and Analysis Department. In the years that followed, the UAE unit expanded its hunt far beyond suspected extremists to include a Saudi women’s rights activist, diplomats at the United Nations and personnel at FIFA, the world soccer body. By 2012, the program would be known among its American operatives by a codename: Project Raven.</p><p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/">reports</a> this year revealed how a group of former National Security Agency operatives and other elite American intelligence veterans helped the UAE spy on a wide range of targets through the previously undisclosed program — from terrorists to human rights activists, journalists and dissidents.</p><p>Now, an examination of the origins of DREAD, reported here for the first time, shows how a pair of former senior White House leaders, working with ex-NSA spies and Beltway contractors, played pivotal roles in building a program whose actions are now under scrutiny by federal authorities.</p><p>To chart the UAE spying mission’s evolution, Reuters examined more than 10,000 DREAD program documents and interviewed more than a dozen contractors, intelligence operatives and former government insiders with direct knowledge of the program. The documents Reuters reviewed span nearly a decade of the DREAD program, starting in 2008, and include internal memos describing the project’s logistics, operational plans and targets.</p><p>Clarke was the first in a string of former White House and U.S. defense executives who arrived in the UAE after 9/11 to build the spying unit. Utilizing his close relationship to the country’s rulers, forged through decades of experience as a senior U.S. decision-maker, Clarke won numerous security consulting contracts in the UAE. One of them was to help build the secret spying unit in an unused airport facility in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Drawn to the UAE with the promise of combating terrorism, dozens of American intelligence contractors cycled in and out of a secret hacking unit over the course of a decade. As time went on, the mission became less focused on preventing violent attacks than on targeting the country’s political enemies.</p><p>In an interview in Washington, Clarke said that after recommending that the UAE create a cyber surveillance agency, his company, Good Harbor Consulting, was hired to help the country build it. The idea, Clarke said, was to create a unit capable of tracking terrorists. He said the plan was approved by the U.S. State Department and the National Security Agency, and that Good Harbor followed U.S. law.</p><p>“The incentive was to help in the fight against Al Qaeda. The UAE is a very good counterterrorism partner. You need to remember the timing back then, post 9-11,” Clarke said. “The NSA wanted it to happen.”</p><p>Clarke’s work in creating DREAD launched a decade of deepening involvement in the UAE hacking unit by Beltway insiders and U.S. intelligence veterans. The Americans helped the UAE broaden the mission from a narrow focus on active extremist threats to a vast surveillance operation targeting thousands of people around the world perceived as foes by the Emirati government.</p><p>One of Clarke’s former Good Harbor partners, Paul Kurtz, said Reuters’ earlier reports showed that the program expanded into dangerous terrain and that the proliferation of cyber skills merits greater U.S. oversight. “I have felt revulsion reading what ultimately happened,” said Kurtz, a former senior director for national security at the White House.</p><p>At least five former White House veterans worked for Clarke in the UAE, either on DREAD or other projects. Clarke’s Good Harbor ceded control of DREAD in 2010 to other American contractors, just as the operation began successfully hacking targets.</p><p>A succession of U.S. contractors helped keep DREAD’s contingent of Americans on the UAE’s payroll, an engagement that was permitted through <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-raven-whitehouse/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=twitter#clearance">secret State De</a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-raven-whitehouse/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=twitter#clearance">partment agreements</a>, Reuters found.</p><p>The program’s evolution illustrates how Washington’s contractor culture benefits from a system of legal and regulatory loopholes that allows ex-spies and government insiders to transfer their skills to foreign countries, even ones reputed to have poor human rights track records – by Joel Schectman and Christopher Bing</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-raven-whitehouse/">https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-raven-whitehouse/</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>The people of al-Wazi'iyah district in </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Taiz?src=hashtag_click">#Taiz</a></span><span> governorate have been facing deteriorating health conditions as a result of the spread of dengue fever and diphtheria and the absence of medical services.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1204484554112806913">https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1204484554112806913</a></span></p><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p><span>State hospitals in Ibb turn away patient with swine flu</span></p><p>The patient was told there were inadequate resources to quarantine him and others who might become infected</p><p>The patient was taken to a private hospital in Ibb for treatment and remains in intensive care, according to the official. </p><p>Swine flu, which is preventable by vaccine, can be fatal if not properly treated. </p><p><span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/local/168">https://al-masdaronline.net/local/168</a></span></p><p><span>(* A H)</span></p><p>Al-Baydha governorate declares state of emergency amid dengue fever outbreak</p><p>The number of cases continues to rise, according to a local official, and at least one person has died from the mosquito-borne illness</p><p>Local officials in the Nate’a district of Al-Baydha governorate in central Yemen have declared a state of emergency after identifying 30 cases of dengue fever, including at least one death.</p><p><span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/local/164">https://al-masdaronline.net/local/164</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>UNICEF Yemen Country Office Humanitarian Situation Report (1 - 31 October 2019)</p><p>The number of suspected Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera cases continued to reduce since the first week in September 2019, with 287 out of 333 districts reporting suspected cases this month so far.

UNICEF is on the ground, working with partners to provide health care, nutrition, safe water, education and more.</p><p>Food insecurity is increasingly threatening the health of Yemen's children. More than 368,000 children under age 5 are suffering from <a href="https://www.unicef.org/yemen/nutrition">severe acute malnutrition</a> (SAM), which can be life-threatening if left untreated. UNICEF and partners work with local health workers to screen and treat children for malnutrition, starting with the most vulnerable, providing timely assessments, essential Ready-to-Eat Therapeutic Food (RUTF) and medical supplies. </p><p>The threat of cholera and acute watery diarrhea continues to loom high in Yemen. In 2017, the country experienced a devastating cholera outbreak. Working with partners, UNICEF has scaled up <span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/yemen/water-sanitation-and-hygiene"><strong>emergency water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) assistance</strong></a></span>, building capacity of local WASH authorities, solarizing water systems and harvesting rainwater. An estimated 5.4 million Yemenis now have access to safe water and 16 million people living in cholera-prone areas have benefitted from water treatment.</p><p>As of the start of the academic year in September 2019, at least 2 million children across Yemen are out of school. UNICEF is adamant about helping these children get back to learning so they can create a better future for themselves and for their nation. With the support of partners, UNICEF is continuing to rehabilitate damaged school buildings and establishing temporary safe learning spaces where children can resume their educations. UNICEF is also providing cash incentives to teachers and school-based staff and educational supplies to keep children learning. To date in 2019, UNICEF has provided access to education for 216,464 children, and aims to reach 800,000 by the end of 2020. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/unicefusa/2019/12/10/heres-how-unicef-is-helping-children-in-yemen/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/unicefusa/2019/12/10/heres-how-unicef-is-helping-children-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>8 facts about girls’ education in Yemen</p><p>In Yemen, about 32 percent of girls are married before the age of 18 with 9 percent being married before turning 15. Due to poverty, girls in Yemen are being married off as a source of income. Marriage will reduce the cost of looking after girls and is believed to offer girls the safety a husband can provide. However, <a href="https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/child-marriage/yemen/">Girls Not Brides</a> is an organization dedicated to ending child marriage. This organization aims to raise awareness of the negative impact of child marriages through open discussions with communities. It mobilizes policy to bring child marriages to an end and works to empower girls and offer them a support network.</p><p>According to UNICEF, there is a significant gender gap in education in Yemen’s youth with males enrolled in primary school at 79 percent and <a href="https://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Yemen-Gender-Eqaulity-Profile-2011.pdf">females at 66 percent</a>. However, UNICEF is working with the government of Yemen on decreasing this gap and improving the quality of education. The goal is to increase the number of girls enrolled in school. It is also working with other organizations to improve <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/news-and-media/news/joint-statement-dire-situation-teachers-yemen">conditions for teachers</a> in Yemen, which will increase access to education overall.</p><p>The goal of <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/161821468163761893/Yemen-Secondary-Education-Development-and-Girls-Access-Program">the Secondary Education Development and Girls Access Project</a> is to improve gender equity and quality of secondary education with a specific focus on girls in rural areas. </p><p><span><a href="https://borgenproject.org/girls-education-in-yemen/">https://borgenproject.org/girls-education-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span>Bread loaves the "size and weight of a pen" are symbols of Yemen’s currency crisis </span></p><p>The shrinking volume of a popular Yemeni bread is a byproduct of the weakening national currency</p><p>Before the war, Helmi said he could buy 25 rooti for 375 riyals, and the loaves were bigger and heavier. “Now a single loaf is the size and weight of a pen,” he said. </p><p>Helmi’s baker, who spoke to Almasdar Online on condition of anonymity, said the cost of ingredients to make rooti has skyrocketed: The price of a bag of flour has increased from 4,300 riyals to 10,700 riyals, he said, while a bag of yeast has more than tripled in price from 250 riyals to 850 riyals. </p><p>The baker said he called on the authorities to lower flour prices so he and others can offer the same size and weight of bread they used to. Overhead costs including firewood, electricity, water, labor, taxes and other supplies have also increased significantly, he said. </p><p>The price of flour had reached 11,000 riyals per bag at one point, but it has since fallen to about 9,000 riyals, according to an official at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. He refuted the baker’s claim that a bag sold for 4,300 riyals before the war.</p><p>Fadel Sweileh, director general of market stability and consumer protection at the ministry, said he has received complaints about at least 20 bakeries in Aden governorate manipulating the price and weight of rooti, which were set at 20 riyals per loaf (weighing 57 grams) in 2018. Bakeries that don’t comply with ministry regulations are fined 10,000 riyals, he said.</p><p>The manipulation of these regulations is a byproduct of the drop in the value of the Yemeni riyal, whose pre-war exchange rate of 250 riyals per $1 dollar is now nearly 600 riyals per $1. </p><p>"The recent collapse of the riyal raises fears of a new increase in commodity prices due to high inflation," said economist Abdul Wahid Al-Obaly.</p><p>Stabilizing the currency requires an urgent intervention by Saudi Arabia in the form of a $2 billion cash deposit in the Central Bank in Aden, he said, noting that the last Saudi cash injection is running out. </p><p>Due to a lack of controls and unethical practices in the industry, many bakers have begun to use extra yeast in their recipes to make the flour go further. That has led to lower quality rooti, according to many Adenis. </p><p>Some bakeries are now also producing lower quality types of bread aside from rooti. </p><p><span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/167">https://al-masdaronline.net/national/167</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>UNICEF Yemen Country Office Humanitarian Situation Report (1 - 31 October 2019)</p><p>Between January and October 2019, UNICEF received $194.2 million of contributions towards the 2019 Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal, which has been aligned with the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan for 2019. </p><p>In October, Northern Yemen experienced acute fuel and gas shortages due to recent Government regulations on commercial fuel imports. On black markets, the price of fuel rose to over 1,000 YER/litre, almost three times the official price. Many fuel stations were closed or had limited operating hours, with several kilometres of queues and 2-3 days of waiting time. The fuel crisis impacted transportation, pumping of drinking water and power to sanitation systems. In some parts of the country, water in urban centres forced to stop. Without fuel, 15 million people would face water supplies cut. 11 million people (38 per cent of the population) across the country rely on piped water networks, which requires solar or fuel to operate. An additional 4 million people who depend on commercial water trucking might be impacted by the fuel crisis as trucks cannot operate with fuel shortages . Nearly threequarters of hospitals might be impacted by the fuel crisis, to provide health care .</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unicef-yemen-country-office-humanitarian-situation-report-1-31-october-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unicef-yemen-country-office-humanitarian-situation-report-1-31-october-2019</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Trauriger Bericht der Jemenhilfe</span></p><p>"Immer noch gibt es keine Entwarnung im Kriegsgebiet Jemen".

The war in Yemen has killed over 100,000 people and created the world's worst humanitarian crisis, leaving millions suffering from food and medical shortages.

If it decides not to, as it has in the cases of six other countries during this presidency, the shopkeeper’s legal status will end 60 days later.</p><p>TPS was initiated in 1990, in the aftermath of China’s Tiananmen Square massacres. It allows people already in the United States to remain and to work if conflict, environmental disasters or “extraordinary temporary conditions” in the country from which they came make it impossible for them to return there.</p><p>The shopkeeper, identified only as “MM”, was the first speaker in a teleconference organized by the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc.

He said he fears for his life if he were to return and worries about his family still there. He lost his best friend from childhood and several others who have already died in the fighting in Yemen that erupted in 2015.</p><p>“America gave me a chance to start my life again,” MM said, “to work and pay taxes, get health insurance, start a family … to live like a human being.”</p><p>TPS status is granted for 6, 12 or 18 months, depending on a country’s situation. Each country’s status can be extended and, historically, such extensions have included a “re-designation”, too, so that people who’ve arrived in the United States after their country’s TPS began are covered also.</p><p>When the Trump administration came into power, people from 10 countries were eligible for TPS: Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, Somalia, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Sudan and Nepal.</p><p>Since then, DHS has eliminated TPS for six of those 10 and declined to offer re-designations for the four others (Yemen, Syria, South Sudan and Somalia), according to CLINIC’s Jose Magaña-Salgado, one of the teleconference speakers.</p><p>For now, ongoing lawsuits have forestalled deportations of people no longer covered by TPS. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.arabamericannews.com/2019/11/26/yemeni-nationals-in-u-s-backed-into-a-deadly-corner-by-uncertain-tps-policies/">https://www.arabamericannews.com/2019/11/26/yemeni-nationals-in-u-s-backed-into-a-deadly-corner-by-uncertain-tps-policies/</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Craft: Riyadh Agreement is one step closer to political solution</p><p>US Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft hailed on Friday, the Saudi-led Arab Coalition, saying she was encouraged by the Riyadh Agreement struck in November.<br /> "we hope that that’s going to take us one step closer to this UN talks on political solution to the conflict."</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/14984">http://en.adenpress.news/news/14984</a></span></p><p><span>(* A P)</span></p><p>Lawmakers seek suspension, review of US training for Saudis</p><p>A top Republican ally of President Donald Trump went a step further than the White House on Sunday by calling for Saudi Arabia to be suspended from an American military training program after a student pilot from the kingdom shot and killed three sailors at a U.S. naval base in Florida.</p><p>Trump had called for the program to be reviewed but Sen.

In an official statement, Zhang Jun <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/23/c_138577341.htm">called upon</a> the international community to provide “tailored assistance” to improve the living conditions of the Yemeni people and highlighted Yemen as a case for China’s position that development is an effective pathway to peace and stability for countries facing internal conflicts.</p><p>Zhang Jun’s statement on Yemen was noteworthy because it was more specific than Beijing’s traditionally <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-06/18/c_138151410.htm">ambiguous calls</a> for intra-Yemeni dialogue and a political solution to the Yemen war. The Chinese representative’s comments coincide with a broader expansion of China’s involvement in Yemen. As China possesses comprehensive strategic partnerships with Saudi Arabia, Iran and the <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/07/uae-faces-growing-resentment-yemen-war.html">United Arab Emirates</a> (UAE), China has cautiously supported Yemen’s internationally recognized government, while maintaining lines of communication with the Houthis and the Southern Transitional Council (STC). China has leveraged these close diplomatic ties with Yemen’s warring factions to expand its economic presence in Yemen and in turn further consolidate its influence on the Red Sea.</p><p>China’s presence in Yemen is strengthened further by its outreach efforts to the STC. Much like its ties with the Houthis, China’s relations with the STC have historical antecedents.</p><p>China’s economic interests have become codified into official policy, as Beijing supports the inclusion of Yemen into its <a href="http://www.beltandroad.news/2019/06/08/importance-of-yemens-contribution-to-belt-road-asserts-ambassador/">Belt and Road Initiative</a> (BRI) and stated that it “<a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/23/c_138577341.htm">stands ready</a>” to participate in the economic reconstruction of Yemen.</p><p>China’s efforts to integrate Yemen into the BRI largely run through southern Yemen, which acts as a bridge between the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa. According to Ahmed Atef, China views the Gulf of Aden as a strategically important location for the BRI, and Beijing is seeking to reprise its Cold War-era infrastructure construction projects in Aden. In order to protect these investments, China is leveraging its close ties with the Hadi government and the STC to potentially expand its role as a security provider on Yemen’s Red Sea coast. </p><p>To complement these infrastructure investments, China has paid greater attention to Yemen’s economic development needs – by Samuel Ramani</p><p><span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/12/china-boost-influence-yemen-stc-war-economy.html">https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/12/china-boost-influence-yemen-stc-war-economy.html</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>UAE is role model of tolerance, coexistence, peace: Pope Francis</p><p>His Holiness Pope Francis, Head of the Catholic Church praised the UAE's approach that enhances the pillars of tolerance, coexistence and peace.</p><p><span><a href="http://www.wam.ae/en/details/1395302808592">http://www.wam.ae/en/details/1395302808592</a></span></p><p>My comment: Si tacuisses…</p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp12a Katar-Krise / Qatar crisis</span></h2><p>(A P)</p><p>Qatari PM attends Gulf summit but no mention of 2-1/2 year row</p><p>Qatar’s premier attended an annual Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, its highest representation since 2017, but there was no public mention of a 2-1/2 year boycott by its neighbors despite hints of a thaw.</p><p>Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser Al Thani’s presence follows an intensification of efforts to resolve the row among U.S. allies which shattered the GCC alliance amid growing Iran tensions.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-summit/qatari-pm-attends-gulf-summit-but-no-mention-of-2-1-2-year-row-idUSKBN1YE14A">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-summit/qatari-pm-attends-gulf-summit-but-no-mention-of-2-1-2-year-row-idUSKBN1YE14A</a></span></p><p>(A P)</p><p>Qatar emir not attending annual Gulf summit in Saudi Arabia</p><p>A summit of Arab Gulf nations opened on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia without Qatar’s ruler in attendance, despite signs of a thaw in a diplomatic crisis that has gripped the regions U.S. allies.</p><p>Qatar’s Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani instead sent Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser Al Thani to head Qatar’s delegation to the Gulf Cooperation Council meeting.</p><p>The GCC bloc, composed of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain, has been fractured since mid-2017.

A critical discourse analysis of how BBC World vs. Al Jazeera English Constructed Yemen’s 2011 Uprising Coverage</p><p>After some correspondence, my previous university, the University of Gothenburg just published my MA thesis. Written in 2015, titled, "Discursive Construction in Media: A critical discourse analysis of how BBC World vs. Al Jazeera English Constructed Yemen’s 2011 Uprising Coverage" discusses how, in comparison, both online media outlets covered the first 100 days of the uprising.

However, the role of media in the news construction and framing of the Yemeni Uprising in particular has been less wellexamined<span>;</span> that is perhaps attributed to the fact that Yemen’s sociopolitical features are complex, and it is often an intimidating task to analyse the media’s interrelation with the country’s political developments. Hence, in tackling this gap, this thesis focuses on the first stage of Yemen’s 2011 Uprising and how media portrayed it, by specifically displaying a comparative analysis between the BBC World and Al Jazeera English onlinepublished articles during the first 100 days of the Yemeni uprising. These articles represent the initial portrayal that shaped the early understanding of the events in Yemen</p><p><span><a href="https://ub016004.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/62713/1/gupea_2077_62713_1.pdf">https://ub016004.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/62713/1/gupea_2077_62713_1.pdf</a></span></p><p>(* B)</p><p>Feature: Nature reserves in war-ravaged Yemen face risk of abandonment</p><p>Yemeni families used to flock toward nature reserves for relaxation to heal the wounds caused by the years-long military conflict.</p><p>But the negative effects of the military conflict gradually expanded to the beautiful nature reserves in the impoverished Arab country.</p><p>In the southern port city of Aden, families are unable to visit the Huswah Nature Reserve to watch various kinds of protected animals and plants there as they used to do.</p><p>During the past years, the Huswah Nature Reserve received large swarms of migratory birds with around 150 different species but recently the number of migratory birds dwindled until 50 species, according to local officials.</p><p>They said the situation of this nature reserve deteriorated and it faces the risk of abandonment for lack of the government's support.</p><p>The number of visitors to the Huswah nature reserve in Aden significantly decreased in recent months as destruction and negligence hit many parts of the protected land.</p><p>Other residents in Aden asked the Yemeni authorities to intervene and protect the nature reserve from continuing deterioration and destruction.</p><p>"It's necessary to protect the nature reserve because it is considered as a tourist landmark that serves our economy," said Amal Ali, a female resident of Aden Province.</p><p><span><a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-12/09/c_138617986.htm">http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-12/09/c_138617986.htm</a></span></p><p>(A)</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/govt-india">Government of India</a></span>: Sub: Depression over southwest Arabian Sea</p><p>lay centered at 2330 hrs IST of 09th December, 2019, over southwest Arabian Sea near latitude 10.6°N and longitude 57.0°E, about 400 km east-southeast of Socotra Island (Yemen)</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/sub-depression-over-southwest-arabian-sea">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/sub-depression-over-southwest-arabian-sea</a></span></p><p>and</p><p>(* A)</p><p><span>Tropical storm </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pawan?src=hashtag_click">#Pawan</a></span><span>--Rains are continuing in Yemen's </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Socotra?src=hashtag_click">#Socotra</a></span><span> for a week now, with floods damaging everything in this archipelago which has been devastated by several cyclones in recent years.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/FuadRajeh/status/1204234012203597824">https://twitter.com/FuadRajeh/status/1204234012203597824</a></span></p><p>(A)</p><p><span>Rains are continuing to fall on Hadiboh island, part of Yemen's </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Socotra?src=hashtag_click">#Socotra</a></span><span> archipelago, for a fifth successive day.
