The media is failing in holding the government to account in its coverage of the Yemen war and the one dimensional narrative that is repeated over and over again. I am not pro any group in Yemen - all of the warmongers are just test, fighting for power and not caring about the civilian population that is paying the price.</p> <p>But if people heard differing narratives - for example, currently two groups who are anti Houthi are fighting in Taiz causing mayhem to the lives of an already suffering population, and in Aden 'liberated' in July 2015 there has been no attempt to restore order and jobs, and the precious Island of Socotra - a jewel in the world's crown - is now being developed by UAE into a super resort for the rich which must destroy its fragile ecology and spoil what is so precious.</p> <p>For over 2 years the narrative had been that there have been 10,000 killed - the reality is so much higher that that figure is almost laughable if it wasn't so tragic. If people only knew governments would be forced to act in stopping this war - which my research and the research of Channel 4 recently proves that without western assistance the Saudi coalition that is inflicting so much damage would be forced to stop, and if they stopped then it would be easier - not easy but easier - to bring peace to this suffering land.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157533874198641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157533874198641</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p> <p><strong>Between life and death: Yemen air strike survivors relive bombings</strong></p> <p>Victims of alleged Saudi-led air strike in Sanaa describe realising that they were still alive but that their loved ones were gone</p> <p>"When I heard the first bomb, I embraced my son to calm him, but the next bomb destroyed our house while we were inside it," said Um Osamah.</p> <p>Um Osamah is a mother of four children living in Sanaa's Saawan district. </p> <p>Once Um Osamah regained consciousness she started to speak to her child, and when she realised he was safe she started shouting to people to let them know where they were.</p> <p>"I could not walk even one metre from my place as the pieces of wood from the roof were over me, so I was very worried that people would dig over the wood and a wall might fall on us," she said.</p> <p>"That was my only concern, so I kept shouting all the time to let people know where I was."</p> <p>Um Osamah does not know how long she and her son remained under the ruins, poised between life and death.</p> <p>"I was shouting and praying to Allah to save me and my child, and finally I came out from under the ruins," she said.</p> <p>"When I got out, I could not believe that we were safe as the house was completely destroyed, as well as three other houses.</p> <p>"My children, husband, relatives and neighbours were waiting to meet me, and they were very happy to see me safe."</p> <p>Along with the 11 dead, dozens of other civilians were injured in the bombings, with many residents losing everything they had.</p> <p>Um Osamah told people to look for her jewellery and other valuable items under the ruins. She managed to get most of them but most of the furniture was broken.</p> <p>"Life was the most important thing for me. Now we live in my uncle's house but I feel happy as I am still alive and all my family members are good," she told MEE.</p> <p>'Death is better'</p> <p>Zabeebah Fuad lost her husband, Mohammed, in the same bombing in Saawan on 7 April and has been left devastated by the death of her partner.</p> <p>"The bombing happened while I was cooking at my house and my husband was in the sitting room. I do not remember the details very well because I fainted after the bombing and recovered consciousness after they found me under ruins," she told MEE.</p> <p>"I was happy that I was still alive, but after I knew that my husband was killed, I hated life as I have five children without a breadwinner."</p> <p>Fuad and her children live in her brother's house, who is now the breadwinner of the family but is currently without a job.</p> <p>"My children are looking for their father and I cannot forget him at all, moreover my brother cannot provide us with all our needs," she said.</p> <p>"Life has become very difficult, and death is better than this life."</p> <p>Zabeebah is very pessimistic about the future and feels that her children will suffer in their future life.</p> <p>"I hope that my children can overcome all obstacles and achieve their dreams," she said.</p> <p>Happiness of finding someone alive</p> <p>Residents do not hesitate to help victims of the bombings when they happen in their area.</p> <p>When Ali Al-Faeq, 29, heard the bombing in Saawan, he immediately ran to help the victims.</p> <p>Psychological trauma</p> <p>Muneer Qaed, an expert at the Ministry of Education, disagrees with Faeq's rallying call and advises civilians to flee from any targeted areas as air strikes usually involve double-tap strikes in the same place.</p> <p>"We have heard about many people who were targeted by air strikes while they were rescuing civilians under rubble, and walls falling on other rescuers, so it is not at all safe for civilians to rescue people after bombings," Qaed told MEE.</p> <p><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/between-life-and-death-yemen-air-strike-survivors-relive-bombings">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/between-life-and-death-yemen-air-strike-survivors-relive-bombings</a></p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Is the UAE Gearing Up to Annex Yemen’s Socotra Island?</strong></p> <p>The UAE has taken over Socotra after setting up a military base on the Yemeni island and carrying out extensive social and economic development. Is the UAE merely providing humanitarian and economic aid or is it laying the groundwork for the island's future “secession” from mainland Yemen?</p> <p>Socotra, which has been largely forgotten in the ongoing Yemeni crisis, has been a focal point of the UAE. After Socotra was devastated by the <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34764971">Chapala and Megh cyclones</a></span> in November 2015, the UAE provided significant humanitarian aid to the island’s residents.

In the same month, the UAE established a military base on the island, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/anger-erupts-yemen-socotra-uae-deploys-100-troops-180503072636773.html">seizing Socotra’s airport and seaport</a> and building maritime infrastructure and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/socotra-island-yemen-civil-war-uae-military-base-unesco-protected-indian-ocean-a8331946.html?fbclid=IwAR1b3fyYcIu6a7utMnNEH_T4Lal31fqfHMDkN-0sBxae4MG8u6JC-Mskn8U">communication networks</a>.</p> <p>This move is a “mix of the UAE’s both hard and soft power strategies both in Yemen and in the wider sort of Horn of Africa region,” <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2018/05/uae-military-build-socotra-180504205318190.html">said Bethan McKernan</a>, journalist and author of the first witness report on UAE troops in Socotra.</p> <p>The UAE’s military base has created up to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/socotra-island-yemen-civil-war-uae-military-base-unesco-protected-indian-ocean-a8331946.html?fbclid=IwAR1b3fyYcIu6a7utMnNEH_T4Lal31fqfHMDkN-0sBxae4MG8u6JC-Mskn8U">5,000 new jobs</a>.

Emirati businessmen are planning to build luxurious hotels across the island, according to McKernan.</p> <p>A Future UAE Territory?</p> <p>The UAE has exploited the semi-absence and dysfunction of the Riyadh-backed Yemeni government to strengthen its hold in south Yemen. Since 2017, the UAE has supported the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a movement calling for independence in southern Yemen governorates, including Socotra.</p> <p>In a meeting with a group of Socotran sheikhs and residents in late December 2018, Emirati historian <span><a href="https://www.usjournal.net/regions/middle-east/the-uaes-occupation-of-the-yemeni-archipelago-of-socotra/">Hamad al-Matrooshi said</a></span> that the people of Socotra would “be part of the UAE and deserve citizenship without a request,” claiming historical ties between the Emiratis and Socotris.</p> <p>Despite its coalition with Abu Dhabi, Yemen’s government-in-exile has criticized the UAE’s takeover of Socotra, calling the move “<span><a href="https://insidearabia.com/socotra-unesco-protected-threatened-yemens-civil-war/">unjustified</a></span>” and an “<span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/yemenis-protest-uae-presence-socotra-180507142606332.html">assault on Yemen’s sovereignty.</a></span>” Moreover, in May 2018, inhabitants of the island protested to express <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/yemenis-protest-uae-presence-socotra-180507142606332.html">their indignation </a></span> at the UAE’s military deployment across the island.</p> <p>The UAE has categorically denied all accusations regarding its alleged attempts to undermine Yemen’s sovereignty – by Youssef Igrouane</p> <p><span><a href="https://insidearabia.com/uae-gearing-up-annex-yemens-socotra-island/">https://insidearabia.com/uae-gearing-up-annex-yemens-socotra-island/</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>The UAE’s seedy influence operations are a footnote in the Mueller Report</strong></p> <p>Over the past decade, the UAE became a big player in the think-tank scene in Washington DC, which had previously been dominated, on matters Middle Eastern, by the large ranks of big, pro-Israeli American funders like Haim Saban–and to a lesser extent by the Saudis.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, when MBZ wanted to “be influential in American politics”, he followed as much as he could of Saban’s playbook. Not being an American citizen meant that following some of Saban’s three paths to success was a little harder and more complex—but he had two trusty lieutenants to help him out.</p> <p>George Nader</p> <p>One was George Nader, a veteran Lebanese-American fixer who has worked for MBZ for many years and who is also a close associate of big GOP fundraiser– and Trump buddy– Elliot Broidy. </p> <p>Yousef al-Otaiba</p> <p>Another, even higher-level US bagman for MBZ has long been the UAE ambassador in Washington, <a href="https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/his-town/">Yousef al-Otaiba</a>. He has also worked diligently to follow the Haim Saban playbook for how to win friends and influence policy in Washington—including the campaigns to control think-tanks.</p> <p>Controlling the narrative on Yemen</p> <p>All these shenanigans on the behalf of the Gulf-Arab super-rich are important– for a number of compelling reasons. First, the investments that all of them have made, over the past several years, have had a strong effect on public understanding of key issues in the Middle East, and on policy. As noted earlier, these issues include Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Iran.</p> <p>Of these issues, Yemen is the one regarding which these Gulf Arabs have—recently– been least successful in controlling the narrative. Their argument that the Houthi alliance that has controlled the capital, Sanaa, and considerable surrounding areas for many years is illegitimate, is totally controlled by Iran, and is solely responsible for the country’s suffering—and that therefore Americans and everyone else should support the Saudi/UAE alliance that has been battling the Houthis, has finally been exposed on every count. J</p> <p>It has taken four years for the US Senate to get to where it is on the Yemen issue, which is a shockingly long time.</p> <p>Secondly, the capture by these ruthlessly ideological forces of so many of the Washington think-tanks that previously had long reputations for fair-minded, objective research means it is almost impossible these days for anyone reading their output—whether directly, or indirectly, through the way they get quoted in the media—to get anything like an accurate picture of the situation in the countries being described.</p> <p>This applies particularly to Syria</p> <p>Bottom line: If you read something from someone billed as a “think-tank expert” look carefully at their institution’s funding before you judge the value of their work – by Helena Cobban</p> <p><span><a href="https://mondoweiss.net/2019/04/influence-operations-footnote/">https://mondoweiss.net/2019/04/influence-operations-footnote/</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2> <p>(* B H K P)</p> <p><span>230,000+ Affected by Yemen’s New Cholera Outbreak</span></p> <p>Save the Children <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-cholera-outbreak-100000-children-infected-start-2019">reports</a></span> on the latest developments in Yemen’s new cholera outbreak.</p> <p>The conditions created by the war and the Saudi coalition’s policies are allowing an otherwise preventable, treatable disease to rage across Yemen. Yemen’s humanitarian crisis has not abated in the slightest. On the contrary, it shows many signs of getting much worse in the months ahead if there is not an urgent and persistent effort to rein in all warring parties, including and especially the Saudi coalition, and a massive relief effort to avert the many thousands of preventable deaths from hunger and disease that will occur otherwise. Unfortunately, Yemen’s crisis has once again vanished from most of our media coverage, and the governments most responsible for creating that crisis continue to wreck and starve the country with impunity.

Mais au point où en sont les opérations militaires saoudo-émiraties, la partie semble déjà perdue pour Riyad. Robert Bibeau, éditeur du webmagazine Les 7 du Québec, et Bernard Cornut, analyste et écrivain, s’expriment sur le sujet.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw6gf99gOhM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw6gf99gOhM</a></span></p> <p>(* B H P)</p> <p>Yemeni Women: Making the Most of the Space Available</p> <p>In the country’s modern history, three major events have influenced these struggles and women’s political rights: 1) the unification of North and South Yemen in 1990, 2) Yemen’s uprising in 2011, and 3) the war that has been ongoing since 2015.</p> <p>When the two Yemeni states unified in 1990, a reform of the family law took place that was considered an advancement for Northern and a setback for Southern women, as the South had already introduced more progressive women’s rights than the North, for instance, legal equality in family affairs.</p> <p>Then, in the wake of the 2011 uprising, women fought hard for greater and more effective political participation, eventually achieving an unprecedented 30 per cent quota for women in Parliament.<br /> Women also took part in the Constitution Drafting Committee for the first time in the State’s history.</p> <p>Yet, today, all these advancements in the name of women’s rights have been eroded. As the four-year-long war rages on, the political system as a whole has descended into chaos and the push for women’s representation has shifted from political institutions to diplomacy and advocacy.<br /><br /> During the time from the Houthis’ takeover of Sana’a in September 2014 to the Saudi-led military intervention in 2015, the formal political process has ground to a halt. Militarisation has meant a significant loss for women’s political voice and role in decision-making. In fact, the discussion of women’s political rights in Yemen right now, in its current apocalyptic state, seems an extravagant thought.</p> <p>What I lament the most is that pre-war Yemen, with all its institutional injustices against women, had nevertheless overtaken Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its advancement of women’s rights – progress that today is basically undone.</p> <p>Meanwhile, women are pushing back. At the grassroots level, with some 12,000 men arrested and more than 3,000 forcibly disappeared, mothers, sisters, and daughters of those abducted have begun to gather in front of the central prison or police stations across major Yemeni cities in search of their sons, fathers, or brothers. They have organised themselves as a collective named “Mothers of Abductees Association.”</p> <p>Even though Yemen has not witnessed a strong women’s movement in recent history, women have become an important pillar in the formation of a new democratic Yemen since the 2011 uprising. Their activism under the difficult circumstance of continuing conflict has played an important role in shedding light on gross human rights violations and in peace advocacy.

Development Program (UNDP) has released a <span><a href="https://www.undp.org/content/dam/yemen/General/Docs/ImpactOfWarOnDevelopmentInYemen.pdf">report</a></span> on the effects of the war on Yemen, including the long-term effects on the country’s future development.</p> <p>The report is the most comprehensive assessment yet of what the people of Yemen have endured over the last four years, and its findings are a damning indictment of the Saudi coalition intervention and our government’s support for their war. Beyond the estimated 233,000 deaths caused by the war (102,000 from fighting, 131,000 from hunger and disease), the war has set back the entire country by a generation. It will take decades for Yemen to recover, and that’s assuming that the war stops now. </p> <p>By enabling and fueling this conflict from the start of the Saudi coalition intervention, the U.S. shares responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis, and it is very likely that a large majority of those deaths wouldn’t have happened if not for that intervention and our government’s support for it.

More specifically, war profiteers: The five largest US arms makers - Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics - and their dealings with Saudi Arabia worth over $110 billion dollars and counting. By their own account, of all the wars underway from which they are profiting, “none is greater than the Saudi war on Yemen.”</p> <p>The criminal Saudi air campaign, fueled by the US war profiteers, has hit endless civilian targets, using American smart bombs and missiles, without any protest or complaint from the War Party in Washington. Even though the UN Security Council has appointed a group of experts to detail US-backed Saudi war crimes and egregious attacks on Yemeni civilians, including people attending weddings and funerals, nothing has so far come out of the UN headquarters in New York to suggest that the war and the blockade are coming to a decisive end anytime soon.</p> <p>This is while the naval blockade of the country by Saudi Arabia and the UAE has also cut humanitarian aid ships docking in the port city of Hodeida.

The country is in a grinding civil war.</p> <p>“Mothers in Yemen have to make impossible choices all the time,” says Scott Paul, humanitarian lead for Oxfam in Washington. He says that during recent visits to the country, families recounted all sorts of terrible examples. Accessing health care is a constant concern for many: “If a child falls ill, it costs money to pay for transport to a clinic. And that’s a gamble: The clinic may be closed, or lack the required medicine,” he says.</p> <p>Paul says families with young sons face terrible choices: Should they join a militia and fight? They might earn a reliable income the family needs for food and health care, but risk death.</p> <p>Another option, unthinkable under most circumstances, confronts families with girls: When presented with a marriage proposal, should they accept a bride price they need for health expenses and food?

The internal conflict between Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the government of Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, combined with the misuse of many key agricultural and household resources for khat production and consumption, has led to crippling poverty and a high rate of global acute malnutrition (GAM). The continued insecurity, instability and violence have caused the displacement of approximately 3 million people, and have had a devastating impact on food security and livelihoods.</p> <p>As the conflict has continued, the state of the country’s health system, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and schools has deteriorated. In addition to the high number of casualties requiring emergency medical care, the health sector response has also had to deal with the indirect impacts of the war, such as the deterioration of public health systems, people’s fear of using health structures due to their frequent bombing, and significant levels of health-related malnutrition. In April 2017, the difficulty of managing contagious diseases, combined with the degraded economic situation, led to one of the worst cholera outbreaks in recent times, with almost 1 million suspected cases and 2,216 associated deaths (WHO, 2017). Almost 2 million children (27% of the 7.3 million schoolaged children in Yemen) are currently unable to attend school, with more than 1,800 institutions affected by the conflict.</p> <p>A humanitarian response implemented under major constraints</p> <p>Delivering aid in Yemen is extremely challenging. Numerous constraints exist ranging from insecurity in front-line areas to administrative restrictions and logistics problems in reaching rough and mountainous terrain. As the conflict has become protracted and the humanitarian crisis has deepened, the response has struggled to cover the needs of the population.</p> <p>Humanitarian workers have accused the Saudi-led coalition of hampering the delivery of humanitarian assistance by imposing a blockade and then, when it was partly lifted, by continuing to impose excessively cumbersome procedures (UN Panel of Experts on Yemen, 2018). Import restrictions and localised blockages imposed by these local armed groups on the ground are hindering the rapid delivery of critical supplies to people in need. In addition, the presence of checkpoints controlled by armed groups in many districts, and regular air strikes, have restricted the movements of humanitarian operators.</p> <p>Operations in these areas are very difficult and sometimes impossible.<br /> Humanitarian workers have been denied travel permits to different cities and the parties to the conflict impose arbitrary and excessive restrictions. The UN Panel of Experts on Yemen has criticised all parties to the conflict for increasing the suffering of civilians by impeding the delivery of humanitarian assistance. </p> <p>Overall effectiveness of the response</p> <p>Despite all these constraints, life-saving operations have been reasonably effective.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.alnap.org/help-library/yemen-case-study-%E2%80%93-sohs-2018">https://www.alnap.org/help-library/yemen-case-study-%E2%80%93-sohs-2018</a></span> = <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/sohs-2018-case-study-yemen">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/sohs-2018-case-study-yemen</a></span></p> <p>and full report: <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/SOHS%202018%20Yemen%20CS.pdf">https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/SOHS%202018%20Yemen%20CS.pdf</a></span></p> <p>For ALNAP: <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALNAP">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALNAP</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp4 Flüchtlinge / Refugees</span></h2> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/unhcr">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a></span>: Republic of Yemen: Shelter/NFIs Fact Sheet, March 2019</p> <p>Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster assisted 18 percent out of 3 million people planned to be reached in 2019.</p> <p>More than 151,800 people were displaced by the conflict in the first quarter.</p> <p>The situation on the conflict frontlines remains intense and generates new waves of displacements for over 25,300 families (or 151,800 people) to mainly Hajjah and Al Hudaydah, Al Dhale'e and Amran governorates.</p> <p>Most frequent Shelter/NFIs issues cited by affected population are overcrowding, families unable to afford rent payments, high cost of shelter materials in the local market, lack of basic household items in the local market, and when available families do not have the means to purchase them and lack of lighting in their shelters.</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/republic-yemen-shelternfis-fact-sheet-march-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/republic-yemen-shelternfis-fact-sheet-march-2019</a></span></p> <p>(B H)</p> <p> <a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/unhcr">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a>: Yemen: CCCM Factsheet – March 2019</p> <p>Conflict between Hajour tribesmen and defacto-authority led to displacement of more than 5,000 individuals in Hajjah Governorate.</p> <p>SMC trainings delivered in Hajjah and Aden Governorates with participation of NGO Partners and local authority.</p> <p>Gap of funding hindering SMC expansion to cover more than 1,060 IDP hosting sites accommodating 412,000 IDPs.</p> <p><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-cccm-factsheet-march-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-cccm-factsheet-march-2019</a></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/unhcr">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a></span>: Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster Monthly Situation Report - March 2019</p> <p>The Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster assisted 260,147 people through 25 active partners during the reporting period.</p> <p>The displacement from Kushar district continues, reaching to about 8,400 families who fled the conflict between Hajour tribesmen and the de-facto authorities.</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/shelternficccm-cluster-monthly-situation-report-march-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/shelternficccm-cluster-monthly-situation-report-march-2019</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/unhcr">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a></span>: Yemen: UNHCR Operational Update, 26 April 2019</p> <p>Despite the on-going conflict at the frontlines, UNHCR continued to provide lifesaving emergency assistance to those fleeing violence.

First of all, it completely shreds the narrative of supposed ‘violent rebels’ holding the capital, but rather shows a competent government institution showing a willingness to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people, it re-establishes the Yemeni democracy and seeks to make Yemen a prosperous nation.”</p> <p>“It's also a sign of Yemen opening its arms to the international community. They want to re-establish good and equal relations with the countries of the world, as well as open up for foreign investments.”</p> <p>The idea of a new National Vision was initially proclaimed by the former Yemeni President Saleh al-Sammad. Samad was killed during a coalition airstrike last year. </p> <p>A famous quote by the former president, "one hand protects, the other hand builds," has been used as the slogan for the Sana'a government’s new vision.</p> <p>Some of the many critical areas of focus for the government include raising the average life expectancy and improving electricity and water supplies, while also reducing the illiteracy rate and tackling corruption.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/04/26/594431/Yemens-Houthis-begin-radical-reforms-plan">https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/04/26/594431/Yemens-Houthis-begin-radical-reforms-plan</a></span></p> <p>My comment: Paper is patient.

The coalition was always a loose tie between people's who all aimed to defeat the northern militias, but they had differing aims - they include Islah, who have a strong political and commercial base and want a stake in future united Yemeni government, Salafist militias and Al Qaeda types who have their own anti western ideology, southern secessionists who want southern independence, militias paid by UAE who mainly are recruited from conservative Sunni groups, some of whom are ex-Al Qaeda, tribal groups associated with one province or area, Saudi with its anti-Iran agenda and also initially at least wanting military success to cement the succession of the line of King Salman, UAE who want commercial control especially of ports in the region, USA and U.K. that want to sell weapons, keep a close link with main oil producers, and dominate the region via their allies in the GCC. And many many more.</p> <p>It was never likely that if and when they gained control that they could find any agreement. And so it has turned out. Since the first few months of war, there have been rumours and evidence of stark differences between each of these groups - causing a split with Qatar and the other coalition partners, and battles between groups affiliated with KSA and UAE.

They were denied visits from their families and kept in solitary confinement during these ordeals, and were sentenced to death in sham mass trials that lacked even a modicum of due process.</p> <p>The barbaric mass state murders carried out by the regime in Riyadh constituted a calculated political act driven by both domestic and international objectives. Its immediate aim is to intimidate the Shia minority, which constitutes approximately 15 percent of the population and is concentrated in the Eastern Province, a key oil-producing region.</p> <p>At least three of those put to death were minors at the time of their alleged offenses, making their executions a flagrant violation of international law barring the death penalty for children.</p> <p>The main responsibility for the crimes of the Saudi regime rests with its principal patron, US imperialism. The savage monarchy in Saudi Arabia, with its public beheadings, is not merely some remnant of feudal backwardness. It is rather the direct product of US imperialist intervention in the Middle East, from the concessions secured by Texaco and Standard Oil in the 1930s and 1940s to the current massive arms sales that make the Saudi monarchy today’s number one customer of the US military-industrial complex.</p> <p>Washington has responded to the mass beheadings in Saudi Arabia with a deafening silence. While the day before the beheadings were announced, the State Department issued a statement in connection with its severe tightening of punishing sanctions against Iran, demanding that it “respect the rights of its people,” there was no such appeal to Riyadh, much less any condemnation of minors having their heads chopped off in public squares.</p> <p>The Pentagon and the CIA are full partners in the Saudi monarchy’s repression at home</p> <p>The executions in Saudi Arabia provide an appropriate prism for viewing the entire US policy in the Middle East. The bloodbath is a manifestation of the predatory aims pursued by US imperialism in the region. Washington’s defense of and reliance upon this ultrareactionary regime expose all of the pretexts given for successive US military interventions, from the so-called “war on terrorism” to the supposed promotion of “democracy” and “human rights.”</p> <p>In the end, a US foreign policy that is founded upon a strategic alliance with the House of Saud will inevitably prove to be a house of cards that will come crashing down with the revival of the class struggle in the Middle East, the United States and internationally – by Bill van Aucken</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/saudi-regime-beheads-37-political-prisoners/5675739">https://www.globalresearch.ca/saudi-regime-beheads-37-political-prisoners/5675739</a> </span></p> <p><strong>(** A P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Saudi Arabia said they confessed.

Some claimed to have evidence of their abuse at the hands of their interrogators. And one reaffirmed loyalty to King Salman and his son, Mohammed bin Salman, in hopes of getting leniency from the court, trial documents show.</p> <p>None of these arguments swayed the judges overseeing their trials in 2016, and the suspects were convicted of terror-related crimes and sentenced to death. </p> <p>CNN has obtained hundreds of pages of documents from three 2016 trials involving 25 of the men whose executions were announced this week. Eleven were found guilty of spying on behalf of Iran, the country's regional nemesis. Another 14 were convicted of forming a "terror cell" during anti-government protests in the largely Shia city of Awamiya in 2011 and 2012. Most of them were from the country's much-maligned Shia minority.</p> <p>For the authorities, the trial of those involved in the Awamiya protests was an open and shut case -- the men had confessed, and "justice was served," in the words of <span><a href="https://us.cnn.com/2019/04/23/middleeast/saudi-executions-terror-intl/index.html">one Saudi official to CNN on Tuesday</a></span>. </p> <p>But the documents obtained by CNN show that far from owning up to their confessions, some of the men in the Awamiya case repeatedly told the court that the admissions were false and had been obtained through torture. In some cases, the suspects said they had provided nothing more than their thumbprints to sign off on confessions which they claimed had been written by their torturers.</p> <p>"Those aren't my words," said one of the accused, Munir al-Adam, during the trial</p> <p>Most of the prisoners who were executed were members of the kingdom's minority Shia community, which has long protested against the political and economic marginalization of the religious group.</p> <p>Several of the cases involving those who were executed center on Awamiya, the Shia city in the country's Eastern Province, where Arab Spring protests took root in 2011 – By Tamara Qiblawi and Ghazi Balkiz</p> <p><span><a href="https://us.cnn.com/2019/04/26/middleeast/saudi-executions-court-documents-intl/index.html">https://us.cnn.com/2019/04/26/middleeast/saudi-executions-court-documents-intl/index.html</a> </span></p> <p><span>and a shorter survey: </span><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/saudi-men-executed-confessed-duress-report-190427072137621.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/saudi-men-executed-confessed-duress-report-190427072137621.html</a></span></p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p><span>Saudi Arabia beheads and tortures man for sending WhatsApp message</span></p> <p>SAUDI ARABIA has reportedly conducted a “mass execution” with a man who was detained as a teen killed for sharing anti-government messages on WhatsApp.</p> <p>Abdulkarim al-Hawaj, now 21, was beheaded in front of a sick crowd after being accused of being a "terrorist" for sending the message about a protest when he was just 16.</p> <p>He was a Shiite Muslim – a group that is often called heretical and persecuted in the Sunni dominated desert kingdom – and was allegedly tortured with electrical cables and forced to confess.</p> <p>Another victim, Munir al-Adam, was just 23 when he was arrested in 2012 and reportedly had his feet so badly beaten he was forced to crawl on his hands and knees for days.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/774884/saudi-arabia-mass-execution-abdulkarim-al-hawaj-whatsapp-amnesty">https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/774884/saudi-arabia-mass-execution-abdulkarim-al-hawaj-whatsapp-amnesty</a> </span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>Film: “He called me today and said I will call you next Tuesday if I were alive”.

The region presents an excellent opportunity for the United States “to have a unifying role,” for the maritime transit path, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/red-sea-rivalries-the-gulf-the-horn-and-the-new-geopolitics-of-the-red-sea/">Zach Vertin, a fellow at the Doha Center of Brookings Institution, told USNI News on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>Speaking after a Brookings Institution forum on the Red Sea, Vertin said the United States had been focused early on ensuring freedom of maritime movement from its leading role in anti-piracy patrols and keeping the 15-mile-wide chokepoint at Bab al Mandab <a href="https://news.usni.org/2017/06/06/pentagon-oil-tanker-hit-3-rpgs-near-yemen-bab-el-mandeb-strait">open during the continuing civil war in Yemen</a>.</p> <p>In short, what is happening is “two distinct regions are fast becoming one across the shores of the Red Sea,” he said at the forum and in conversation with USNI News.</p> <p>The former French colony Djibouti offers possibly the best view of the coming together of commerce, security and foreign presence. Joining the Americans in Djibouti are two Indo-Pacific powers — Japan and China, which now has its first overseas base. Both came to the Horn of Africa to participate in the maritime patrols to rein in pirates, primarily operating from Somalia. The Chinese also use their facility as a logistics hub for its peacekeepers on the continent.</p> <p>While the presence in Djibouti of military personnel from Japan, France and Italy is not well known to Americans, China’s has drawn increased attention and concern in Washington. That visible presence of the two great powers in such a small place “is a test case for China and a test case for us,” Vertin added in operating close by without falling into conflict.</p> <p><span><a href="https://news.usni.org/2019/04/19/panel-u-s-base-in-djibouti-key-to-american-interests-in-africa">https://news.usni.org/2019/04/19/panel-u-s-base-in-djibouti-key-to-american-interests-in-africa</a></span></p> <p><span>My remark: And it’s of importance for the US in Yemen War, of course.</span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p><span>ONE YEAR SCHOLARSHIP AND THE REJECTION OF MY APPLICATION FOR THE VISA TO FRANCE</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://muradsubay.com/2019/04/28/one-year-scholarship-and-the-rejection-of-my-application-for-the-visa-to-france/">https://muradsubay.com/2019/04/28/one-year-scholarship-and-the-rejection-of-my-application-for-the-visa-to-france/</a></span></p> <p>Comment: Prominent <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a></span>-i artist <span><a href="https://twitter.com/muradsubay">@muradsubay</a></span> has been denied a visa to <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/France?src=hash">#France</a></span> where he had a 1-year scholarship.

Despite many hailing Mukalla’s April 2016 “liberation” by U.S.-backed forces on the ground as a major success in the struggle against terrorism in Yemen, the reality is that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula remains a grave threat in the war-torn country for a host of reasons, including a willingness by some of Washington’s allies to coordinate with the group in their fight against Iran-allied Houthis.</p> <p>From Washington’s vantagepoint, AQAP’s capture of an <span><a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/16/al-qaeda-takes-over-airport-in-yemen.html">airport</a></span>, the <span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/09/yemen-mukalla-uae-al-qaeda/570943/">port</a></span> in Mukalla, and an <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/world/middleeast/khaled-bahah-houthi-rebel-yemen-fighting.html">oil export terminal</a></span> constituted an unacceptable development in the Yemeni crisis. Thus, in no small part due to pressure from the U.S., Abu Dhabi, and its allies in Yemen concentrated on removing AQAP from power in Mukalla. The Emiratis amassed a force of <span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/09/yemen-mukalla-uae-al-qaeda/570943/">12,000</a></span> Yemeni and Emirati fighters, primarily made up of tribal fighters from Hadramaut, to expel AQAP from Mukalla.</p> <p>That the U.S.-backed forces successfully took back Mukalla rapidly enabled the UAE to better position itself vis-à-vis Washington and other Western capitals as a rising power in the Arab world that carries out its responsibilities in the global “war on terror.”</p> <p>Since AQAP’s loss of Mukalla, U.S.-backed Emirati operations against the terrorist group have also led to AQAP losing significant power</p> <p>Over the past three years, AQAP has benefited from its established financial networks and ability to recruit disenfranchised Yemenis who support the group’s Salafist ideology. AQAP’s success in maintaining its foothold in Yemen since losing Mukalla has been largely attributable to the organization’s projection of a more moderate image in the eyes of Yemenis</p> <p>Another factor which has boded well for AQAP has been the Saudi-led military coalition’s focus on combating Houthis</p> <p>From an American standpoint, the gravest threats to U.S. national security out of Yemen are the local al-Qaeda and ISIS branches.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the threat that AQAP poses not only to Yemenis, but to global security at large will remain real. Unfortunately, the odds are good that Yemen will continue to remain in chaos with the world’s worst humanitarian disaster.</p> <p>Hence, three years after Mukalla’s liberation, there is sound reason to be worried about an AQAP comeback soon – by Giorgio Cafiero</p> <p><span><a href="https://insidearabia.com/al-qaeda-yemen-three-years-mukallas-liberation/">https://insidearabia.com/al-qaeda-yemen-three-years-mukallas-liberation/</a></span></p> <p><span>Comment by Judith Brown: </span>This story really is based on a fabrication. It is true that AQAP occupied Mukalla and part of Hadramaut in 2015-2016. In 2016 a deal was done and Al Qaeda moved from Mukalla and UAE forces moved in. Although it was claimed that there was a fight, there was credible evidence that this was a deal as fighters moved out in an organised manner with their equipment - and money presumably - to other governates like Shabwa. The graves of the alleged 800 dead fighters have never materialised.</p> <p>A detailed investigation by AP asserted that many of the previous AQ fighters from Mukalla were then recruited by UAE for brigades such as Shabwa elite forces, Giant Brigades, Security Belt, although a denial by UAE said that these were fighters forced to align with AQ who then defected to support the UAE militias. Either way, these new UAE paid fighters were all from very conservative Sunni backgrounds, the same background that recruits AQAP members. This story gives the narrative from the perspective of the Saudi coalition in its entirety.</p> <p>So it's not surprising that AQAP are in Yemen - they never left, although the hard core Al Qaeda have been attacked by UAE funded militias - and US drones - since then with some success. Interestingly recent rumours suggest that these AQAP fighters have recently been pushed back by Houthi militias, in places like Al Dhalea and Al Bayda, and they are now approaching Aden again four years after they were expelled. The Houthis have far more motivation to defeat AQAP than the UAE paid militias who are after all Al Qaeda lookalikes by many accounts. I also hear that Mukalla is tightly controlled by UAE forces and is more stable than many other parts of Yemen.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157534397173641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10157534397173641</a></span></p> <p>My comment: The comment refers to the fake story of Mukalla’s “liberation.

While some support for the statute was simply politically partisan, some was clearly intended to protest the Saudi murder of American journalist Jamal Khashoggi or to address the tragic humanitarian crisis in Yemen — arguably the greatest such crisis in the world today. But the statute would have rewarded Iran (which provides ballistic missiles and other support to Yemen’s Shiite Houthis, who hate Israel, Jews, and the United States, and admire Iran’s Hezbollah terrorists), undermined peace and stability in the region, and placed at risk one of the most important maritime chokepoints to international petroleum commerce. </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/in-vetoing-congresss-yemen-resolution-trump-stood-up-to-a-lawbreaking-legislature/">https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/in-vetoing-congresss-yemen-resolution-trump-stood-up-to-a-lawbreaking-legislature/</a></span></p> <p>(A P)</p> <p>More Saudi coalition “We are benefactors” propaganda</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.sabanew.net/viewstory/48863">https://www.sabanew.net/viewstory/48863</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="http://www.arabnews.com/node/1488921/saudi-arabia">http://www.arabnews.com/node/1488921/saudi-arabia</a></span> and <span><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1697961/ksrelief-chief-meets-un-resident-coordinator-yemen">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1697961/ksrelief-chief-meets-un-resident-coordinator-yemen</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/4103">http://en.adenpress.news/news/4103</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/4094">http://en.adenpress.news/news/4094</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp16 Saudische Luftangriffe / Saudi air raids</span></h2> <p><span>Siehe / Look at cp1</span></p> <p><span>(A K pH)</span></p> <p>Precision air strikes by Saudi-led coalition with intelligence and training support from the USA and the UK continue to kill civilians in <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a></span>.

The latter type has been the most difficult because it has so many challenges.<br /> Yemen isn't underreported in media just like that. It's underreported partially because there is a deliberate decision to ignore it - and dismiss its people's stories. I have so many stories about many Yemenis doing great things but I am frustrated with how I must push so hard to get just one story out, like Huda's story.<br /> I am also fortunate to have some of the most supportive and understanding editors whom I cherish very much. Thank you so much, guys.<br /> I think it's important for editors and publications to believe, trust and support Yemeni journalists who typically would bring untold stories about their community so people like Huda could also receive the recognition they deserve – by Afrah Nasser</p> <p><span><a href="http://afrahnasser.blogspot.com/2019/04/why-is-supporting-yemeni-journalists.html">http://afrahnasser.blogspot.com/2019/04/why-is-supporting-yemeni-journalists.html</a></span></p> <p>(-)</p> <p>Music: <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrWvrn9cKaBcptQQglYXoiQ">Sada Alebda Studios</a>: </span>Game Of Thrones - Yemeni Hadrami Style (cover )</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Ivh_8uqQk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Ivh_8uqQk</a></span></p> <p>(C P)</p> <p><span>The story of the assassination of President Al-Hamdi in the front again.
