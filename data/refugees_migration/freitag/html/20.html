A huge proportion are alleged to have destroyed civilian property and killed civilians in violation of international humanitarian law.</p><p>Since 2018 GLAN has been developing a repository of digital evidence on the Saudi/UAE-led bombing campaign in Yemen where violations of international law appear to have occurred. This resource seeks to address both the lack of coordination in evidence gathering and also bring together in a single workflow user generated digital information with evidence from private individuals (e.g. journalists, witnesses) and NGOs. Our goal is to support or make possible future legal accountability efforts for these attacks by preserving information in accordance with the highest legal standards.</p><p>Since 2018, we have been building &amp; actively maintaining a database of Coalition airstrikes &amp; cluster bomb attacks. This user-friendly system enables the cross-referencing of large quantities of evidence and will be available to partner organisations seeking to promote accountability in the future. It brings together key pre-existing technologies to allow online user generated content and private evidence to be stored and viewed together. </p><p>One key objective of the database is that it will grow as we recieve more information on Coalition attacks, and that, where safe to do so, it will be made available to trusted partners for use in accountability efforts. If you or your organisation would be interested to discuss the database, please contact Dearbhla Minogue on dminogue@glanlaw.org. For secure communications, we welcome the use of PGP encryption.</p><p>After lengthy consultations with other organisations who had encountered the same challenges (most prominently in the case of investigations into Syrian airstrikes), GLAN teamed up with a number of core partners to design core functionalities for the database that would be cost-effective and workable. Key features of our system include:</p><p>Open-source evidence: Preservation of online user generated audio-visual evidence is carried out using Digital Evidence Vault, a Google Chrome plug-in which downloads and stores a copy of crucial online content. This program uses distributed ledger technology (blockchain) to authoritatively time-stamp the content. GLAN also log key OSINT information from the investigations of our partner organisations, Bellingcat and Yemeni Archive. </p><p>Direct evidence: Mnemonic (Syrian Archive, Yemeni Archive) will be our partner for the preservation of directly-received material (e.g. from journalists and witnesses).</p><p>All evidence is sorted by GLAN with future legal accountability efforts in mind and to make feasible a thorough analysis of an unwieldy amount of content. The database is relational, which means that each piece of evidence is linked both to an airstrike and the source of the evidence. Where necessary, sources’ identification is coded, so that the database, if breached, would be less likely to lead to their identity being revealed. </p><p><span><a

P)</strong></p><p><strong>The Riyadh Agreement Dilemma</strong></p><p>Commentary by Abdulghani Al-Iryani</p><p>A key obstacle to nationwide peace negotiations is the formation of a Yemeni government delegation that includes the Southern Transitional Council (STC). This was meant to be a key outcome of the Saudi-brokered Riyadh Agreement the two rival parties acceded to last year. As it stands, however, successful implementation of the Riyadh Agreement requires redeploying forces loyal to Yemeni President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi in Aden, his government’s interim capital, risking renewed bloody confrontations with STC-affiliated forces that would wreck the peace negotiations. This is the dilemma of the Riyadh Agreement.</p><p>Implementation of the Riyadh Agreement has been frustrated by disagreement on the sequencing of implementation, an issue that is often cited as the reason for scuppering the proposed 2016 Kuwait Agreement. The STC insists on appointing a governor and a chief of police for Aden before it redeploys its forces out of the city; Hadi insists on the opposite. Distrust and demonstrably bad intentions on both sides have poisoned the implementation talks. While the two sides profess compliance, they continue to take military actions that belie their rhetoric. </p><p>The Saudis, who rammed this agreement down the throat of both sides, seemed to have skipped their history lesson. Instead, they bought into the prevailing narrative that presents this conflict as one between a faction, supposedly dominated by northerners, who wish to preserve Yemeni unity, and southerners who are trying to rid themselves from northern domination and restore their old state. Pundits, meanwhile, note the competition between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. They also point out the declared target of the UAE to eliminate Islah. While valid, none of these characterizations captures the nuances of reality.</p><p>Representation of southern Yemen after the [1994] conflict was monopolized by Hadi’s group, the Zumra. The Toghma, who represented a majority of the people of the South, were largely marginalized. For years, military and security officers of the Toghma were out of work and often out of livelihoods. Domestic and international pressure forced Saleh to pass decrees to reintegrate them into the national army. Still, Saleh’s behavior from 1986 until he resigned in 2012 indicated his intentions to continually undermine the South.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/10258#ENDnote"><sup>[12]</sup></a></span> He appointed Hadi as head of a presidential committee charged with reintegrating forcibly discharged southern officers, knowing full well that Hadi would do his utmost to obstruct its implementation to punish his former enemies. In 2001, Saleh tried to tinker with the Zumra monopoly on southern representation by courting some Al-Dhalea figures and firing one of the Zumra’s most powerful figures, then-Minister of Interior General Hussien Arab. In response, the Zumra announced a political coalition, Caucus of the Sons of Southern and Eastern Governorates, that threatened to call for southern independence. The Zumra were no more pro-unity than the Toghma, but rather had used their alliances with northern forces and the central government in an effort to marginalize their southern competitor.</p><p>This history should make it clear that the struggle for southern Yemen is not merely a political conflict – it is a conflict of identities. Southerners, especially the Toghma-affiliate STC, are doing themselves a disservice by presenting the conflict as one between the South and the North, as denying the real dynamics of the discord makes its resolution impossible. In turn, attempting to implement the Riyadh Agreement without dealing with the underlying causes of the STC-Hadi government rivalry will only complicate the situation.</p><p>Still, successful implementation of the Riyadh Agreement is seen as a prerequisite for progress toward negotiations for a nationwide cessation of hostilities.</p><p><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/10311">https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/10311</a> = <span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/10258">https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/10258</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Hadi must go</strong></p><p>Yemeni President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi is doing his best to prevent an end to the conflict in Yemen. Ensuring that last year’s Riyadh Agreement – meant to mend divisions with his rivals in southern Yemen – never gets implemented is only his latest venture in this regard. Hadi’s tenure has been a case study in parasitic statesmanship, in which only his amoral pursuit of riches and self-preservation has been able to rise above his ineptitude. During his presidency, now in its ninth year, he has overseen Yemen’s steady dissolution from a nation hoping to transition to democracy post-Arab Spring, to a nation fragmented by civil war and regional military intervention, to a land of warring statelets, mass suffering and despair. Enough – it is time for Hadi to go. Once this clear necessity is acknowledged by all concerned parties – in particular Saudi Arabia, his patron, the United Nations Security Council, which bestows on him international legitimacy, and the shrinking number of Yemeni actors who ally with him for lack of better options – then the conversation can shift to how to replace him. </p><p>At a basic level, Hadi never had the qualities associated with successful leadership. Former President Ali Abdullah Saleh appointed Hadi his deputy following the 1994 civil war because the latter – showing little in the way of managerial competence, decisiveness, charisma or vision – posed little threat to Saleh’s rule. </p><p>Hadi’s claim to the presidency is also tenuous. Following the 2011 Yemeni uprising, the internationally-backed Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) initiative facilitated Saleh’s exit from office and Hadi’s ascent, with the latter’s popular mandate of a two-year transitional term affirmed in a one-candidate ‘election’ in 2012.</p><p>Hadi’s two-year term was extended for one year in 2014. Following the Houthi forces’ invasion of the capital in September of that year, Hadi’s flight south and eventually to Riyadh, and the regional military intervention in March 2015, his term as president became indefinite and unaccountable to the Yemeni people. </p><p>Hadi’s legitimacy to head Yemen’s ‘internationally recognized government’ is almost wholly conferred by the UNSC and the international community through UNSC Resolution 2216, which recognizes him as the legitimate president of Yemen in the wake of the Houthi takeover of Sana’a. His legitimacy is entirely detached from his performance as a head of state. Riyadh, meanwhile, for the most part sees Hadi as useful for providing international legal cover for its military campaign in Yemen, and little else. This lack of accountability has allowed Hadi’s presidency to metastasize into a government in exile that serves primarily as a vehicle for corruption.</p><p>Hadi’s small inner circle, made up of his sons and powerful figures from his home governorate of Abyan, are far from the only figures profiting from the conflict, but given their placement atop the government hierarchy, the scope and scale of their corruption are exceptional. The continuity of this graft is dependent on Hadi maintaining the presidency, while at the same time any negotiated end to the war will likely require Hadi to transition out of power.

Now his home city has been hit so hard by coronavirus that the UN believes a quarter of its population may be infected, and hospitals have had to turn away patients with symptoms. So, between jobs and not associated with any hospital, caring for his own community has become Dr Derwish’s full-time unpaid occupation. Shortly after Aden’s first COVID-19 cases were announced in late April, he purchased supplies with his own money and began making house calls to sick neighbours and friends. As he fasted for Ramadan, he himself fell ill, and friends and relatives succumbed to the virus. But Dr Derwish continued to treat the sick, taking meticulous notes on his</span> phone – notes that became this diary.</p><p>AD: Since COVID-19 began in China and then went on to attack a lot of other countries, I remained in a state of denial, even though I took some minor precautionary measures. I’m not hiding that. Seeing all the other countries falling down when faced with it, when my country still had no cases, made me think “Oh, maybe it forgot about us, as always”, but this time it was a good thing for Yemen to be forgotten. I thought maybe Yemen’s isolation would save us. Or that perhaps we have better immune systems because we deal with lots of other diseases that people in Western countries have probably never even heard of.</p><p>One of the things that made me hesitant to believe what was happening around the world is that most of the information regarding the disease is coming from governments, both here and in the West. It was coming from governments that we in Yemen lost trust in a long time ago.</p><p>I never expected to see what is happening right now, here in Aden. The situation is insane. People are falling down, one by one, like dominoes. Especially the old and middle-aged. It starts with fever, then very quickly comes difficulty breathing, and then sudden death. People are still afraid, and they hate to hear the name of the virus. Even some medical staff won’t say it in public, like it’s cursed.</p><p>Many people in these notes died. Others survived, and said to death: “Stop. I still have a life to live.”</p><p>I never thought I would write something like this, and I did not plan for it to be published. I never thought that my notes would make a difference to anyone. I still believe they might not. But I want to share this experience. Maybe some people care?</p><p>3 May 2020</p><p><span>On the tenth day of Ramadan, a Sunday, </span>my younger brother Osama plays a match in the Ramadan football league, on the beach. The match ends around 6pm. Osama feels a little tired and has an intermittent light dry cough. He sleeps for a few hours and feels better, but I still think he should rest, so I go out to buy groceries – one of Osama’s chores in our family. </p><p>While I’m out shopping, I see my neighbour and close family friend Hussain, who tells me his father, Wagdi, is feeling sick and needs help. I go over to their house. Inside, Wagdi has a big plastic bag full of medication another doctor has prescribed. I take a look at the results of some blood tests he has done, and everything looks normal. I conclude he probably has the flu, or maybe he’s exaggerating a bit: the “man flu”, as a friend of mine calls it.</p><p>To understand how we got here – before I started writing these notes – let’s go back in time a little bit.</p><p>It was on the fifth day of Ramadan, 28 April, the day before the first official cases of coronavirus were announced in Aden, that Wagdi began to feel unwell. He is 56 and has diabetes and high blood pressure. He saw a doctor, complaining of fever, fatigue, and some muscle aches in his lower limbs. The doctor thought Wagdi might have some sort of mosquito-borne infection, like chikungunya or dengue fever [both are fairly common in Yemen, and Aden has recently had flash floods so there are lots of mosquitoes around].</p><p>Then, on the eighth day of Ramadan, 1 May, Osama played football. After the game finished, he went to break his fast at his friend Ahmed’s house in al-Mansoura, a different district of Aden. While they were eating, Ahmed told the others he had been feeling sick for the first five to seven days of Ramadan, with general weakness, tiredness, and a fever. He said he was ok now, but that his dad wasn’t feeling well. </p><p>When he got back, Osama described al-Mansoura, which is more crowded than Buraiqa, where we live in Aden. Al-Mansoura has lots of private hospitals and clinics. “It’s really scary,” he said. <span>“I think it’s Yemen’s Wuhan. Everyone is walking around with IV lines in their arms. There’s water in the streets [from the floods] and sewage. The mosquitoes are the size of birds. It is a very infected city. It feels infected. It smells infected. It looks infected.”</span></p><p>The next day, Ahmed took his father to al-Amal Medical Centre, which is usually for cancer treatment. The government has turned it into a hospital for COVID-19 patients. </p><p>Unfortunately, his father died a few hours later.</p><p><span><a

However, COVID-19 testing remains extremely limited — only six labs across the country have testing capacity. The limited testing capacity, along with lack of access to health facilities and the associated stigma with seeking treatment for COVID-19, hides the true impact and spread of the virus.

Das Unglück dieses Paradieses ist seine strategische Lage am Horn von Afrika. Ihretwegen haben es die Ölscheichs der Arabischen Emirate auf die kleine Insel abgesehen.</p><p><span>Auf die Hilfslieferungen folgten die Soldaten. «Die Emirate bauten einen Stützpunkt für ihre Armee», sagt McKernan. «Schon seit dann tun die Emiratis auf Sokotra eigentlich, was sie wollen», sagt sie. Im Grunde sei es egal, wer im Gouverneurspalast sitze.</span></p><p><span>Die Korrespondentin besuchte Sokotra vor zwei Jahren, nach einer abenteuerlichen Überfahrt auf einem Fischkutter.

Insbesondere die islamistischen Muslimbrüder sieht er als grosse Feinde für die Stabilität. Wohl in der Angst, sie könnten Revolten anstossen und so das Modell der Alleinherrschaft, wie er es vertritt, unterminieren.</span></p><p><span>Entsprechend setzen die Emirate in den Konflikten der Region häufig auf Warlords und autoritäre Regime, von Sudan über Ägypten bis Libyen ging das so. Als Rivalen der Emiratis rüsten dann häufig die Türkei und Katar die Gegenseite hoch.</span></p><p><span>Die südjemenitische Küste verläuft parallel zur wichtigsten Seefahrtroute für die Emirate, vom Golf von Aden ins Rote Meer, dem sogenannten «Tor der Tränen».

The report maps out shifts in Yemen’s political geography over five years of conflict, recommends that policy makers rethink the requirements for peace and argues that a wider range of actors need to be included in UN-led talks.

They contribute to serious human rights violations, where the Saudi-led bombing campaign is systematically hitting civilian targets in contravention of the rules of war.</p><p>Just like Britain, the United States has also licensed billions of dollars of arms sales to Riyadh since Saudis and the mere extras entered the illegal war on Yemen. The Saudis are leading the brutal military operation in which US and UK-supplied aircraft, bombs and missiles are playing a major role. The British and American military officials are also in the command and control centre for Saudi airstrikes.</p><p>One side-effect of the chaos resulting from this criminal campaign is that the local franchises of Al-Qaeda and ISIL are now thriving as never before. Worse yet, the Saudi-led campaign has claimed thousands of lives and triggered a humanitarian catastrophe amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>As a consequence, international aid organisations are calling on the UK and US governments to suspend their illegal arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Some have even launched formal legal challenges in courts to halt the sales on those grounds. But to no avail.</p><p>The response from the British and American governments has been thoroughly cynical. They deny any evidence of Saudi violations, simply ignoring the world’s leading human rights organisations, who have been documenting such crimes since 2015.</p><p>This is not surprising. For decades, the regime changers have provided arms to their regional vassal capable of being used for external aggression and internal repression. They play lip service to the UN Charter and the global Arms Trade Treaty, and expect not to be held to account.</p><p>The Anglo-American military alliance with Riyadh shows British and American complicity in the horrors of Yemen. It is the most overt manifestation of the criminal relationship between London, Washington and Riyadh in recent years. The worst part is that they refuse to change this criminal course even during the devastating coronavirus pandemic.</p><p><span><a href="https://en.farsnews.ir/newstext.aspx?nn=13990418001099">https://en.farsnews.ir/newstext.aspx?nn=13990418001099</a></span></p><p><span>(* A K P)</span></p><p>Pompeo says U.S. seized Iranian weapons on way to Houthi rebels in Yemen</p><p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that U.S. and partner forces seized a boat in June carrying Iranian weapons to Houthi rebels in Yemen as he renewed his call for the U.N.

Dies könnte der Auftakt sein zu einer Methode, mit der sich nach dem Crowdsourcing-Prinzip gesammelte Beweise besser auswerten lassen, sodass Organisationen mehr Informationsquellen für ihre Verfahren bekommen.</span></p><p>Die aktuelle Initiative wird geleitet von der britischen Swansea University und mehreren Menschenrechtsorganisationen. Sie ist Teil von laufenden Bemühungen, die mutmaßlichen Kriegsverbrechen im Jemen zu beobachten, um Verantwortliche zur Rechenschaft ziehen zu können. Im Jahr 2017 begann die Plattform Yemeni Archive mit der Zusammenstellung <span><a href="https://yemeniarchive.org/en/database">einer Datenbank</a> von Videos und Fotos, die Fehlverhalten dokumentieren. Die Inhalte stammen von tausenden Quellen, direkt von Journalisten und Bürgern ebenso wie aus sozialen Medien wie YouTube und Facebook; damit sie nicht unentdeckt verändert werden können, sind sie mit Blockchain-Technologie gesichert.</span></p><p>Auf dieser Grundlage und zusammen mit der Organisation Global Legal Action Network (GLAN) begannen die Forscher dann, Belege für konkrete Menschenrechtsverletzungen <span><a href="https://www.glanlaw.org/airstrike-evidence-database-yemen">in einer weiteren Datenbank</a> abzulegen, um Verfahren vor verschiedenen nationalen und internationalen Gerichten einzuleiten. „Um vor Gericht eine Verantwortung nachzuweisen, reicht es nicht aus, nur zu zeigen, was geschehen ist“, sagt dazu Yvonne McDermott Rees, Professorin an der Swansea University und Leiterin der Initiative. Man müsse auch konkret belegen, warum ein bestimmter Fall ein Kriegsverbrechen sei. So könnten illegale Waffen zum Einsatz kommen oder bei Luftangriffen Zivilisten ins Visier genommen werden.</span></p><p>In dem aktuellen Fall <span>konzentrieren sich die Partner auf die in Großbritannien hergestellte Streu-Munition BLU-63. Verwendung und Verkauf solcher Explosiv-Waffen, die beim Auftreffen kleinere Sprengkörper verbreiten, sind in 108 Ländern einschließlich Großbritannien verboten. Wenn sich vor einem britischen Gericht beweisen lässt, dass die Munition tatsächlich für Kriegsverbrechen</span> eingesetzt wurde, könnte damit der Verkauf von Waffen aus dem Land nach Saudi-Arabien gestoppt werden; ebenso wären Strafprozesse gegen Personen möglich, die an den Verkäufen beteiligt sind.</p><p><span>Also entwickelten die Forscher ein Maschinenlern-System, dass alle Fälle des Einsatzes von BLU-63 in der Datenbank erkennen soll. Allerdings sind Bilder davon genau wegen der Illegalität selten, sodass das Team nur wenige Daten aus der echten Welt hatte, um sein System zu trainieren. Also entwickelte es eine synthetische Datensammlung auf Grundlage eines simulierten 3D-Modells der Munition.</span></p><p>Anhand der wenigen vorliegenden Real-Beispiele, darunter ein Foto von BLU-63 aus dem Imperial War Museum, entwickelte das Team zusammen mit Adam Harvey, einem Experten für maschinelles Sehen, die 3D-Rekonstruktionen. Zu einem Grundmodell kamen photorealistische Texturen hinzu, unterschiedliche Schäden und Muster. Die Ergebnisse wurden dann unter verschiedenen Licht-Bedingungen und in verschiedenen Umgebungen berechnet, sodass hunderte Standbilder entstanden, die reale Aufnahmen der Munition sein könnten. Um die Quote der falschen Positiv-Meldungen zu verringern, erstellte Harvey außerdem synthetische Daten zu anderen Objekten wie einem grünen Baseball, die mit BLU-63 verwechselt werden könnten.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Forscher-wollen-mit-Maschinenlernen-Kriegsverbrechen-dokumentieren-und-verfolgen-4835504.html">https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Forscher-wollen-mit-Maschinenlernen-Kriegsverbrechen-dokumentieren-und-verfolgen-4835504.html</a></span></p><p>For information in English: <span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/25/1004466/ai-could-help-human-rights-activists-prove-war-crimes/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/25/1004466/ai-could-help-human-rights-activists-prove-war-crimes/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.glanlaw.org/airstrike-evidence-database-yemen">https://www.glanlaw.org/airstrike-evidence-database-yemen</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Yemen’s disaster becomes “cataclysmic”</p><p><span>T</span>he five year-old war in Yemen is intensifying.

The torrential rainfall and deadly floods claimed tens of lives, affected thousands of people and partially destroyed houses and businesses, mainly in urban areas, in addition to tents and belongings of internally displaced people. Roads and bridges were damaged, water supplies polluted, and basic services for thousands of people were cut.</p><p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Yemen Red Crescent Society (YRCS) assessed the damages and provided support to those affected by the floods.</p><p>Amid heavy seasonal rains, deadly floods swept through Yemen affecting the lives of thousands of Yemenis who were already devastated by the ongoing conflict, seasonal diseases, high inflation, and compromised health care system, while facing the arrival of COVID-19.</p><p>The torrential rains destroyed houses, and damaged an already fragile infrastructure, making some roads impassable in Raymah province, Marib City, and surrounding areas. At least 9,146 families were affected, with Sana'a City and most parts of Sana'a governorate particularly badly hit by flooding. Moreover, over 5,130 families have been affected in Hajjah province alone.</p><p>In the southern governorates, an estimated 4,764 households have been affected in camps for the internally displaced people, including 1,812 families in Aden, 1,037 in Abyan, 917 in Taiz and 770 in Lahj governorates. The heavy rains and the weakened infrastructure have set a fertile ground for seasonal and waterborne diseases, which continue to claim dozens of lives in Yemen.</p><p>Following the assessments of the damage caused by the floods, the ICRC with the YRCS, supported about 130,000 people affected by the floods around Yemen.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/torrential-floods-wreak-havoc-war-struck-yemen">https://www.icrc.org/en/document/torrential-floods-wreak-havoc-war-struck-yemen</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H P)</span></p><p>Support for community initiatives builds resilience in Yemen</p><p>Yemen is teaching us that it’s possible to strengthen national institutions and build human capital – even in times of conflict – by investing in effective local actors so they are stronger when peace returns.</p><p>From the start, the World Bank adopted a new approach to the situation, introducing sustainable, inclusive interventions. The Bank’s strategy for the Middle East &amp; North Africa shifted its engagement from working around instability to working toward stability.</p><p>As Yemen’s conflict became more protracted, the Bank, through the Emergency Crisis Response Project, supported the Social Fund for Development (SFD)—a large, national institution the Bank had supported, financially and technically, for over two decades to deliver support to vulnerable populations.</p><p>Backing community development</p><p>Tamkeen is an example of SFD support. A longstanding program for development planning, it encourages social and economic resilience in the face of conflict by assessing a community’s resources—its skills, public facilities, financial resources, and building materials—and ensuring that local participation in any new infrastructure projects includes women, internally-displaced persons, and other marginalized groups.</p><p>The program places conflict-created distrust to one side, empowers the poorest communities, and strengthens social cohesion. This includes the election of Village Cooperative Councils (VCCs), which are trained to convince people not to wait for handouts but to mobilize themselves.</p><p>With a budget of US$197,000, one SFD-Tamkeen project has carried out more than 700 small-scale projects serving nearly 80,000 people in the Al-Salfiah district in central Raymah, the poorest, most inaccessible governorate in Yemen. Its initiatives include building and rehabilitating rural roads, improving land and water sources, protecting learning facilities and health facilities, and training people in healthcare and in crafts.</p><p>Under the supervision of 90 rural youths (50% of them women), Al-Salfiah’s community elected 93 people to the village councils, another 50% of them women. Mohamed Kawesh, Tamkeen’s local coordinator and community participation director, described this as the largest and most meaningful community response he had witnessed, outdoing anything similar in peacetime.</p><p>The program relies on local contributions as well. Abdulsalam Aljarmi, a trader from Kazoma village, said he contributed over US$1,000 to build and pave a road to his mountain-top village.</p><p>Tamkeen works by providing each village financial support for its largest initiative, scheduling it for last in order to sustain community momentum throughout the smaller projects that come before it.</p><p>A budget of US$22,000 in conditional financing for such a project ignited competition between Al-Salfiah’s 146 local communities, prompting talk about progress rather than conflict. “I visualize this like parts of a vehicle. Each part is doing its role so that the vehicle moves uphill and reaches its destination,” Kawesh, the local Tamkeen coordinator, said. Locally, he said the level of violence subsided.</p><p>Tamkeen’s engagement of women helps build peace and social resilience. “Here, it is unprecedented that women’s voices are clearly heard,” said Kawesh</p><p>In 2017 and 2018, the SFD-Tamkeen program helped establish 1,900 village councils, which ran 6,300 self-help initiatives and 938 Tamkeen-supported initiatives in 37 out of Yemen’s 333 districts.</p><p>Tamkeen is an example of the sort of nutrition and microfinance programs the World Bank has supported in Yemen since 1997.</p><p><span><a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/arabvoices/support-community-initiatives-builds-resilience-yemen">https://blogs.worldbank.org/arabvoices/support-community-initiatives-builds-resilience-yemen</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>FAO Supports Smallholder’s Resilience in Yemen through Animal Disease Control, Vaccination and Mass Treatment Campaigns</p><p>The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations in Yemen, through the Smallholder Agriculture Production and Restoration Enhancement Project (SAPREP), funded by the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme (GAFSP) in collaboration with the World Bank, launched a national animal vaccination and treatment campaign in partnership with local agriculture offices at the governorate and district levels.</p><p>1.8 million sheep and goats in 48 districts throughout six governorates of Yemen to be vaccinated and treated against Peste des Petits Ruminants and Sheep and Goat Pox, benefiting over 41,000 rural households.</p><p><span><a href="http://www.fao.org/neareast/news/view/en/c/1295363/">http://www.fao.org/neareast/news/view/en/c/1295363/</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>UNICEF Yemen Country Office Humanitarian Situation Report (Reporting Period: 1 - 31 May 2020)</p><p>COVID-19 continues to challenge the implementation of some UNICEF programmes due to restrictive measures imposed by local authorities, such as closure of schools and child-friendly spaces.</p><p><span>The supply movement in country remains challenging due to long pre-approval processes and delays in receiving required clearances and permissions.

Unfortunately, the host communities of Al Jofenah area used to get water by water trucking, which is very costly. However, the IDPs of Al Jofenah Settlement accustomed to run behind the water trucks to get a few liters of clean water. “When we see the water truck, we run behind it to get some liters of water, while not catching the water truck, we have to buy water from the grocery.” Salma Awbal said.</p><p>IDP Settlements without clean water can spread disease instead of providing shelter and protection.<br />Hundreds of IDPs encounter an increased risk of infection by seeking shelter in hosting settlements that lack necessities, including water, sanitation, and hygiene services. “It's been ages since I had a shower, and I always get ill because I sleep on the ground, where there is a mess, as you can see. We cannot clean where we sleep due to the shortage of water.” That’s what Al Hajjah Salma added.</p><p>To end up the suffering of the IDPs including Al Hajjah Salma, Building Foundation for Development (BFD), funded by Yemen Humanitarian Fund (YHF) implemented three water projects in three targeted sites, (Al Jofenah - Al Athar - The Community College), in which two elevated reservoirs with a capacity of 200 m 3 were constructed, and a ground reservoir was established. Moreover, the urban water networks of each site were rehabilitated, and water distribution points were established in each site too. </p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/providing-water-idp-settlements-marib-gov">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/providing-water-idp-settlements-marib-gov</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>UNHCR: 13% of Yemenis displaced by war</p><p>Some 13 per cent of Yemenis have been displaced by the ongoing conflict in the country, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Yemen warned yesterday.</p><p>Jean-Nicolas Beuze said that besides diseases such as cholera and malaria, the coronavirus <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200311-who-describes-coronavirus-outbreak-as-pandemic/">pandemic</a></span> has <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200410-war-torn-yemen-confirms-first-coronavirus-case/">exacerbated</a></span> people’s tragedies and complicated the work of local partners, warning that the virus could have dire consequences on the situation the ground.</p><p>Remarking on the impact of the lack of funding on the UNHCR’s work, Beuze explained that, like other humanitarian organisations, UNHCR faces an ethical dilemma having to choose who will receive assistance and in what way.</p><p>“Lack of funding forces us to significantly reduce the number of shelter packages that we distribute in emergency situations which could lead to thousands of families living in the open and being exposed to many risks in times of floods; without protection from infectious diseases or exploitation,” he said.</p><p>The UN official explained that reducing the number of beneficiaries of UNHCR’s cash assistance program will leave dozens of families without the ability to purchase food, medicine or clothing and will force displaced families and refugee to make dangerous choices to secure their livelihoods, such as reducing their food rations, begging or engaging in dangerous work or sending their children to do so.</p><p>He noted that UNHCR’s cash assistance program has become a lifeline for more than 1.5 million of the most vulnerable displaced Yemenis.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200707-unhcr-13-of-yemenis-displaced-by-war/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200707-unhcr-13-of-yemenis-displaced-by-war/</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span>Mother Helpage || Qurbani Project 2020 || Yemen Needs You</p><p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-jA7FDBico">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-jA7FDBico</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>IOM Yemen - Marib Response (01 July 2020)</p><p>As conflict activities along frontline areas in Marib and Al Jawf frontline subside, new displacements into Marib have also slowed.
