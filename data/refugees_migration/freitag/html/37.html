The threat, condemned by their financial backer, the United Arab Emirates, is expected to flounder given a lack of support. Meanwhile, the country already is ravaged by hunger and cholera, and now is fighting the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The United Arab Emirates announced April 25 it does not support a decision by the Southern Transitional Council</p><p>“Is the UAE continuing to pay? The main complaint of the STC, and that’s their main reason having made their declaration, is that their people are not being paid," Lackner said. "The military and security guys not being paid are pretty likely to change sides. I think the reason the STC made that decision and publicize was partly to improve their image, because their image had suffered considerably as a result of their inaction in connection with floods and the coronavirus.”</p><p>Lackner says the STC miscalculated when making their self-rule declaration.</p><p>“They were shocked at the negative response they’ve had everywhere, not only internationally," Lackner said. "Everybody has been saying for years: We want a united Yemen, we don’t want separation. The future has to be discussed within the international framework. The U.N., EU said the same thing. But I think they expected a different response internally. What’s happened is that all the other governorates immediately rejected it.”</p><p>Lackner added that the STC was in danger militarily of being cut off between Aden and the small hinterland it holds, which also may figure into its stepping back from its declaration. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/yemens-southern-separatists-backing-self-rule-declaration">https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/yemens-southern-separatists-backing-self-rule-declaration</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Southern Yemeni journalist launches attack against STC</p><p>Growing dissatisfaction amongst Southern Yemenis wth UAE-backed mercenaries</p><p>A prominent Southern Yemeni journalist has launched a verbal attack against the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), accusing it of carrying out Abu Dhabi’s agenda in southern Yemen.</p><p>“The STC did not emerge from the peaceful Southern Movement that was launched in 2007, and it is not an extension of it as its supporters are trying to pretend,” journalist Shafie al-A’abd said in a tweet.</p><p>He added that the STC is in essence, in the nature of its origins and its objectives, only an Emirati tool that Abu Dhabi uses to implement its geopolitical agenda.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.uprising.today/southern-yemeni-journalist-launches-attack-against-stc/">https://www.uprising.today/southern-yemeni-journalist-launches-attack-against-stc/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>Instability in Southern Yemen Exposes Rift Between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi</p><p>In late April, Emirati-supported separatists in southern Yemen declared self-administration, demonstrating further strains in the Saudi Coalition and a growing divergence of interests between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi.</p><p>The actions of the Southern Transitional Council (STC) stem in part from ongoing delays in the implementation of a unilateral cease-fire, announced by Saudi Arabia in early April.</p><p>Even if recent developments do not signal a more formal break in the alliance between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, what they do suggest is that Abu Dhabi seems unwilling to trust Riyadh in achieving foreign and security policy objectives on the former’s behalf.</p><p>The timing was interesting considering that within the same 48-hour time period, Emirati-backed Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar dissolved the parliament declaring himself the ruler of Libya, a move effectively ending the 2015 Skhirat Agreement.</p><p>Even if recent developments do not signal a more formal break in the alliance between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, what they do suggest is that Abu Dhabi seems unwilling to trust Riyadh in achieving foreign and security policy objectives on the former’s behalf. This means that the UAE is likely to assert further independence and pursue its own narrowly defined goals, even if that means increased friction with the Kingdom as both countries seek to navigate conflicts in Yemen and Libya while attempting to portray a unified front against growing Iranian regional influence. Under successive administrations, first President Obama and now President Trump, the United States has been content to defer to its allies in the Middle East. In turn, this has encouraged them—particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE—to carve up client-state fiefdoms and extend patronage networks as a form of proxy warfare, thus prolonging civil wars in the

The government, supported by international donor states, viewed it as a strategic tool to alleviate poverty and reduce unemployment by expanding financial services to small and micro entrepreneurs to increase their share of the national economy. However, persistent challenges facing the microfinance industry have stunted its development, reach within the population and overall socioeconomic impact. More recently, the institutions, businesses and individuals involved have also faced challenges associated with the ongoing civil war and regional military intervention.</p><p>Structurally, the microfinance industry in Yemen can be separated into two distinct institutional groupings: the formal sector, composed of microfinance banks; and the informal sector, made up of microfinance institutions (MFIs). The primary difference is that microfinance banks are regulated by the central bank and permitted to finance their activities by mobilizing public savings and deposits. MFIs operate outside the central bank’s governance and are thus almost wholly reliant on external donor funds and programs channeled to them through the Social Fund for Development (SFD), a semi-autonomous public institution with the primary mandates of poverty reduction and job creation.</p><p>The formally regulated microfinance industry, given its stronger institutional framework and governance, has garnered a relatively more advantageous environment to develop capacities and strategies to react to local demand, making it more resilient to shocks and adverse events, such as the ongoing conflict. Meanwhile, the informal sector’s dependence on international donor funding – which comes with these foreign organizations’ implementation requirements – has left MFIs with reduced say over the programs they implement and the populations and markets targeted, thereby hindering MFIs’ ability to pursue consistent strategies and specialization. This, in turn, has limited their competitive position, overall impact and organizational development.</p><p>This paper explores the historic development of the industry and its players, as well as the impacts of the ongoing conflict. It then makes recommendations in four areas — capacity building, financing, program design and research — to help create a more conducive operating environment for microfinance overall. This would better place the industry to achieve its socioeconomic aims in the near term and contribute to Yemen’s recovery post conflict – by Moneef al-Shaibani</p><p><span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/9808">https://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/9808</a></span></p><p><span>(A E)</span></p><p>Al-Amal Microfinance Bank gewinnt den Global Finance Innovators Award</p><p>Die Al-Amal Microfinance Bank gewann in ihrer achten Sitzung in der Kategorie Islamic Finance den zweiten Platz bei der jährlichen Auszeichnung von Global Finance (Innovators 2020).</p><p>Der stellvertretende Direktor der Bank, Ghamdan Aoun, sagte der jemenitischen Nachrichtenagentur (Saba), dass diese Auszeichnung die Finanzinnovation der Welt fördert, indem sie die innovativsten Finanztechnologieinstitutionen in verschiedenen Sektoren auswählt, darunter Cash Management, Unternehmensfinanzierung, islamische Finanzen, Zahlungen und Handelsfinanzierung.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.saba.ye/de/news3096234.htm">https://www.saba.ye/de/news3096234.htm</a></span></p><p><span>(* B E K P)</span></p><p>No respite in Yemen</p><p>The oil price collapse dims hope of an energy sector revival, while civil war grinds on</p><p>Yemen was never a major oil exporter, but the regeneration of its energy sector is regarded as a key element in the country’s gradual return to something approaching normal life. Oil production fell from 316,000bl/d in 2008 to 153,000bl/d in 2014, a year before the outbreak of war. It then dropped away completely as international oil companies left, before reviving to around 60,000bl/d in 2019. The war also caused the closure of Yemen’s LNG plant at Balhaf. The 6.7mn t/yr Total-operated facility is undamaged and could be restarted once the fighting ends and the supply of gas feedstock from Block 18 in the Marib basin resumes.</p><p>Getting to a point where oil and LNG exports might restart is proving difficult.</p><p>“Lower oil prices make little difference to the course of the Yemen war,” says Andrew Whitley, a long-time Middle East analyst and former UN official.</p><p>“The trend lines were already set before the latest collapse in prices. The Houthis remain confident they can make further gains in Marib governorate before entering into UN-sponsored peace talks from a position of strength.”</p><p>But it may alter Yemeni dynamics in one crucial way—namely, Saudi Arabia’s role in the conflict. In Whitley’s view, “low oil prices add to the pressure on the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to be able to deliver on his domestic reforms and meet the government payroll monthly bill”.</p><p>Faced with those pressures, MbS may have to accept that his Yemeni adventurism is not going to give him any win that distracts from domestic challenges. A face-saving way of withdrawing from a conflict that is burning a hole in the kingdom’s purse and damaging its international reputation may be a better option.</p><p>A permanent ceasefire in Yemen would both enable oil and gas to flow again—and allow measures to avert a potential environmental disaster.

This strategy is definitely different from that of Iran-backed Shia militias in Iraq and Lebanon, who are trying instead to rebrand themselves as guardians of public health.</p><p>On several occasions, the Houthis politicised the health emergency, blaming the United States and Saudi Arabia for spreading the virus in the country: politicisation accompanies disinformation. For instance, in a televised speech, the leader of the movement, Abdel Malek Al Houthi, described the pandemic as an American “biological warfare” plot.</p><p>Despite exploiting the pandemic as a tool of domestic propaganda, the northern Yemeni insurgents are not interested in gaining popular legitimacy, in their administered areas, depicting themselves as health defenders. Conversely, the Houthis state – in public declarations as well as in online posts – that living in the front line is safer from virus than living in civilian contexts. Moreover, the Houthis stress that dying as “martyrs” on the battlefield is faster and <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/04/14/yemen-and-coronavirus-pub-81534">less painful</a> if compared with passing away as a consequence of pneumonia.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.ispionline.it/it/pubblicazione/how-yemens-houthis-differ-shia-militias-dealing-covid-19-25981">https://www.ispionline.it/it/pubblicazione/how-yemens-houthis-differ-shia-militias-dealing-covid-19-25981</a></span></p><p>My comment: She had written rally good things.

Yemen</p><p>Immediately upon the start of the ceasefire announced by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, the Brotherhood has begun trying to bring together elements of other terrorist organizations such as ISIS and al-Qaeda to launch terrorist operations in the country suffering from security, political and social instability.<br />The Brotherhood’s recent moves and its offering to merge with other terrorist organizations was revealed by several tweets from the Yemeni Islah Party, the political arm of the Brotherhood in Yemen, and came specifically after the return of Brotherhood leader Abdul Rahman al-Sharif to Yemen on Tuesday, April 28, accompanied by his wife.</p><p>Terrorist organizations such as the Brotherhood, al-Qaeda and ISIS have called for the idea of integrating due to the announcement of the Saudi-led international coalition that the ceasefire was taking effect on the occasion of the blessed month of Ramadan, in addition to the military victories that the coalition had achieved on the ground during recently.<br />According to the Yemeni newspaper Almashhad Alyemeni, the return of the Brotherhood leaders to Yemen came after a coordination campaign with the Iranian-supported Houthi leaders, but no intention to carry out terrorist operations was clearly announced.</p><p><span><a

One of these is the Floating Storage and Offloading Vessel (FSO) SAFER, a converted oil tanker moored four miles off the coast of Ras Isa, Yemen, in the Red Sea and continuing to degrade after years of neglect. If no action is taken, <span><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/why-the-massive-floating-bomb-in-the-red-sea-needs-urgent-attention/?fbclid=IwAR3sKHqO05kWWw9l_cfDiwB0ikCwJnLIHEkKY86IHKgXJLUBoAp2K7oau6c">the SAFER will spill as much as 1.14 million barrels of Marib Light crude into the water</a></span>. Much of the world’s activity may be on hold, but the ongoing corrosion on the SAFER is not taking a break to wait out the pandemic.</p><p>In the best-case scenario of a million-barrel spill, up to 75 percent of the oil on board, which has been sitting untended since 2015, would evaporate within a couple of days. In other words, the best-case scenario is a spill the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster. While such a spill involving a light crude oil would be hard to address under normal circumstances, the limited capacity caused by the COVID-19 restrictions means that the impact would be all but impossible to mitigate. Prior work has been done to <span><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/gaming-out-the-disaster-what-could-go-wrong-with-the-fso-safer/">game out the disaster</a></span>, and recent efforts have produced more insights. But the main conclusion remains inescapable: without timely action, a key region of the world may well face an environmental and humanitarian disaster that could easily have been averted—one that could now arrive with singularly destructive timing and inaugurate decades of hardship on top of already dire circumstances.</p><p>The Key Question:</p><p>The question then becomes: given this precarious situation that had presented a nearly intractable problem before the pandemic, what can be done now to safeguard the Red Sea and avert a crisis that will further diminish food security, marine biodiversity, regional stability, and global commerce? There are multiple issues to tackle in answering this question, but three stand out: political, commercial, and technical.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>It is a truism of history that widespread disaster can sometimes create unexpected openings for resolution and renewal. Such could be the case with the SAFER in the time of COVID-19. In the midst of a global crisis, key stakeholders in the Red Sea region and beyond can find a way to resolve a regional crisis.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/safeguarding-the-red-sea-amid-the-coronavirus-preventing-the-spill-of-the-fso-safer/">https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/safeguarding-the-red-sea-amid-the-coronavirus-preventing-the-spill-of-the-fso-safer/</a></span></p><p>My comment: The political implications are odd. Iran has nothing to do with this problem. The Hadi government and the Sanaa governments are at odds which side might Profit from the sale of the crude on SAFER. The Hadi government claims the profit, as it claims to be the only “legitimate” government, the Sanaa government claims the profit as SAFER is on its territory.</p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vorige / Previous:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-648-yemen-war-mosaic-648">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-648-yemen-war-mosaic-648</a> </p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 1-648 / Yemen War Mosaic 1-648:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose</a> oder / or <a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Der saudische Luftkrieg im Bild / Saudi aerial war images:</span></h2><p><span>(18 +, Nichts für Sensible!) / (18 +; Graphic!)</span></p><p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/">http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://www.yemenwar.info/">http://www.yemenwar.info/</a> </span></p><p>Liste aller Luftangriffe / and list of all air raids:</p><p><span><a href="http://yemendataproject.org/data/">http://yemendataproject.org/data/</a></span></p><p>Untersuchung ausgewählter Luftangriffe durch Bellingcat / Bellingcat investigations of selected air raids:</p><p><span><a href="https://yemen.bellingcat.com/">https://yemen.bellingcat.com/</a></span></p><p><span>Untersuchungen von Angriffen, hunderte von Filmen / Investigations of attacks, hundreds of films:</span></p><p><span><a href="https://yemeniarchive.org/en">https://yemeniarchive.org/en</a></span></p></div>
