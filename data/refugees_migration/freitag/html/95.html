In the middle: 28 million Yemenis.</p> <p>Photographer Lorenzo Tugnoli visited Yemen in June and again in November and December for The Washington Post, witnessing the harrowing effects of a conflict that has claimed the lives of more than 50,000 people and created one of the worst famines in history.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/amp-stories/photos-of-war-in-yemen/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/amp-stories/photos-of-war-in-yemen/</a></span></p> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>Film: Fighting, starvation and disease yield grim crisis in Yemen</p> <p>Special correspondent Jane Ferguson reports.</p> <p>Jane Ferguson: The war in Yemen has devastated the economy. Millions are out of work, and the price of food and fuel has spiked. It is home to the worst humanitarian suffering in the world, with countless families unable to feed themselves.</p> <p>The U.N. says two-thirds of Yemenis need food aid and millions are on the brink of famine. I came here in June and found unimaginable misery. Since then, fighting has intensified across the country, and I returned to find the crisis even worse.</p> <p>This hospital is in the capital, Sanaa. Only the lucky ones make it this far. Millions are stranded in rural areas. To find some of those, we headed out to Hajjah, high up in the North Yemen mountains, where the main regional medical center is overflowing with crowds of desperate parents and children.</p> <p>Here, we found Dr. Al Maqtali working hard to save lives. But she only has medicine to give them, when what they really need is food. So they come back again and again, worse each time.</p> <p>How do you feel whenever you are treating them?</p> <p>Dr. Fatoum Al Maqtali: I am feeling very, very sad because I can't help them. When they came here in the outpatient, they are moderate malnourished. I cannot give them food. From where I will give them food?</p> <p>After that, they are coming to the ward with severe malnutrition. This is the process, moderate to severe and dying.</p> <p>Jane Ferguson: We headed further into the countryside. Here at a basic rural clinic, parents waited in line for their children to get examined.</p> <p>They are all from the same area?</p> <p>The daily weighing and measuring of tiny arms comes to the same conclusion every time: When the tape shows red, it means severely malnourished.</p> <p>Driving deeper into the mountains, we learned of a family struggling to keep their newest born alive. Here, in their isolated community, they were living only on rice and prayers.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/fighting-starvation-and-disease-yield-grim-crisis-in-yemen">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/fighting-starvation-and-disease-yield-grim-crisis-in-yemen</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/food-donations-snatched-from-the-starving-in-yemen-1.562629">https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/food-donations-snatched-from-the-starving-in-yemen-1.562629</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1 Am wichtigsten / Most important</span></h2> <p><span> <a class="bootstrap_oembed" href="https://twitter.com/Ali59684325Noha/status/1079835826215895040">Eingebetteter Medieninhalt</a></span></p> <p><span><a class="bootstrap_oembed" href="https://twitter.com/ICRC/status/1079584932597354496">Eingebetteter Medieninhalt</a></span></p> <p>Siehe unter: Für wen das Thema ganz neu ist / Look at: Who is new to the subject</p> <p><span>(* A H P)</span></p> <p>UN: Im Jemen werden Hilfspakete unterschlagen</p> <p>Das Welternährungsprogramm der Vereinten Nationen WFP hat die <span><a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/thema/huthi">Huthi-Rebellen</a></span> im Jemen eindringlich zur Unterstützung bei der Lebensmittel-Versorgung aufgefordert.

It is even more widespread in territories controlled by the Houthi rebels, the struggling government’s main enemy during the nearly four years of warfare that has spawned the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>Some observers have attributed the near-famine conditions in much of the country to the coalition’s blockade of ports that supply Houthi-controlled areas. AP’s investigation found that large amounts of food are making into the country, but once there, the food often isn’t getting to people who need it most — raising questions about the ability of United Nations agencies and other big aid organizations to operate effectively in Yemen.</p> <p>The U.N.’s World Food Program has 5,000 distribution sites across the country targeting 10 million people a month with food baskets but says it can monitor just 20 percent of the deliveries.</p> <p>This year the U.N., the United States, Saudi Arabia and others have poured more than $4 billion in food, shelter, medical and other aid into Yemen. That figure has been growing and is expected to keep climbing in 2019.</p> <p>Despite the surge in help, hunger — and, in some pockets of the country, famine-level starvation — have continued to grow.</p> <p>An analysis this month by a coalition of global relief groups found that even with the food aid that is coming in, more than half of the population is not getting enough to eat</p> <p>In some parts of the country, fighting, roadblocks and bureaucratic obstacles have reduced the amount of aid getting in. In other areas, aid gets in but still doesn’t get to the hungriest families.</p> <p>in interviews with the AP, two top U.N. relief officials used strong language in reference to both the Houthis and their battlefield adversaries.</p> <p>Geert Cappelaere, Middle East director for UNICEF, the U.N.’s emergency fund for children, said authorities on “all sides” of the conflict are impeding aid groups — and increasing the risk that the country will descend into widespread famine.</p> <p>“This has nothing to do with nature,” Cappelaere told the AP. “There is no drought here in Yemen. All of this is man-made. All of this has to do with poor political leadership which doesn’t put the people’s interest at the core of their actions.”</p> <p>David Beasley, executive director of the U.N.’s food program, said “certain elements of the Houthis” are denying the agency access to some parts of rebel territory — and appear to be diverting food aid.</p> <p>“It’s a disgrace, criminal, it’s wrong, and it needs to end,” Beasley said in an interview Sunday with the AP. “Innocent people are suffering.” – by Maggie Michael</p> <p><span><a href="https://apnews.com/bcf4e7595b554029bcd372cb129c49ab">https://apnews.com/bcf4e7595b554029bcd372cb129c49ab</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ap-report-yemens-food-donations-are-being-snatched-from-the-starving">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ap-report-yemens-food-donations-are-being-snatched-from-the-starving</a></span></p> <p><span>and also </span><span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-famine-food-supplies-civil-war-block-a8705031.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-famine-food-supplies-civil-war-block-a8705031.html</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201901011071134076-militants-yemen-stealing-food-shipments/">https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201901011071134076-militants-yemen-stealing-food-shipments/</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4804380/yemen-corruption-famine-food/">https://globalnews.ca/news/4804380/yemen-corruption-famine-food/</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM6rHA6CLJU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM6rHA6CLJU</a> (film by Aljazeera)</span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><strong>(** A H P)</strong></p> <p><strong>WFP demands action after uncovering misuse of food relief intended for hungry people</strong></p> <p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is demanding an immediate end to the diversion of humanitarian food relief in Yemen after uncovering evidence of the practice in the capital, Sana’a, and other parts of the country controlled by the Ansarullah (Houthi) movement.</p> <p>A WFP survey of registered beneficiaries has revealed that many in the capital have not been receiving the food rations to which they are entitled. In other areas, hungry people have been denied full rations. Millions of people depend on food assistance for their survival in Yemen which has been torn apart by a bitter civil war between government forces and Houthi insurgents.</p> <p>The misappropriation of food relief came to light in a WFP review conducted during recent months. It was prompted by an increasing number of reports of humanitarian food for sale on the open market in the capital. What the checks unearthed was fraud being perpetrated by at least one local partner organisation tasked by WFP with handling and distributing its food assistance. The local organisation is affiliated with the de facto Ministry of Education in Houthi-controlled Sana’a.</p> <p>“This conduct amounts to the stealing of food from the mouths of hungry people,” says WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “At a time when children are dying in Yemen because they haven’t enough food to eat, that is an outrage. This criminal behaviour must stop immediately.”</p> <p>During their checks, WFP monitors amassed photographic and other evidence of trucks illicitly removing food from designated food distribution centres. They also found that the selection of beneficiaries was being manipulated by local officials and that food distribution records were being falsified. It was discovered that some food relief is being given to people not entitled to it and some is being sold for gain in the markets of the capital.</p> <p>“I’m asking the Houthi authorities in Sana’a to take immediate action to end the diversion of food assistance and ensure that it reaches those people who rely on it to stay alive,” says Beasley. “Unless this happens, we’ll have no option but to cease working with those who’ve been conspiring to deprive large numbers of vulnerable people of the food on which they depend. Meanwhile, we’re continuing our investigations and addressing those shortcomings which have given rise to this misuse of aid.”</p> <p>In areas prone to abuse, WFP is pressing for an overhaul of the relief system, including an ongoing push for more monitoring, reform of the beneficiary selection process to ensure that food gets to those most in need, and the nationwide introduction of biometric registration of beneficiaries. These changes have been repeatedly resisted by the de facto authorities in Houthi-controlled areas.</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/wfp-demands-action-after-uncovering-misuse-food-relief-intended-hungry-people">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/wfp-demands-action-after-uncovering-misuse-food-relief-intended-hungry-people</a></span></p> <p><span>and also </span><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/houthis-stole-food-mouths-hungry-yemenis-181231143128776.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/houthis-stole-food-mouths-hungry-yemenis-181231143128776.html</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/yemen-starvation-food-aid-stolen-1.4962576">https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/yemen-starvation-food-aid-stolen-1.4962576</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46722502">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46722502</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/video-un-says-yemen-food-aid-being-stolen-in-houthi-run-areas/">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/video-un-says-yemen-food-aid-being-stolen-in-houthi-run-areas/</a> (film by Reuters)</span></p> <p><span>My comment: Well, it’s interesting how Western media seem to focus on the Houthi side of this problem.

And though, undoubtedly, all parties must bear responsibility in the litany of injustices that have befallen civilians, the ferocity and Saudi Arabia’s overwhelming firepower have in no uncertain terms put the burden of guilt on the kingdom and its ruling elite, namely Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a man whose penchant for blood and revenge are now common knowledge following Jamal Khashoggi’s murder.</p> <p>Amid so many ruins, among the ashes of what was once the Republic of Yemen, activists have rallied around what they feel is the cornerstone of any potent democracy: education. An unspoken casualty of war, education or rather the lack thereof could quite literally push Yemen into the abyss of radicalism, whether political or religious.</p> <p>In September 2018 the United Nations announced that with 80 percent of all Yemeni children being now dependent upon humanitarian aid to survive, education did not even figure as a viable feasibility. Worse still, the UN children’s fund says the education sector is on the brink of collapse because of conflict, political divisions and chronic underdevelopment.</p> <p>UNICEF spokesman <span><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/education-a-major-casualty-of-yemen-s-war/4573629.html">Christophe Boulierac</a></span> said around two million children are not going to school this year.</p> <p>The agency has warned that children who are out of school run many dangers, for example, boys are at risk of being used as child soldiers while girls are likely to be married off at an early age. Considering the fact that three-quarters of the women in Yemen have been married before the age of 18, and 44.5 percent before the age of 15, the issue of education is a serious one indeed.</p> <p>Many activists in Yemen have, in fact, argued that the issue, should it be left unaddressed, would tear at the very fabric of society and condemn millions to a life filled with trauma, abject poverty and overall hopelessness. In such a vacuum it is likely Wahhabi-inspired radicals would find yet another <span><a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/ga11761.doc.htm">recruiting pool</a></span>.</p> <p>Acutely aware of the dangers looming over their future, Yemenis are making a stand; away from war, violence and senseless revenge, their ambition is to provide both teachers and students a safe place to grow and learn. If the project is in itself ambitious, it is also courageous. Many powers would like nothing better but to see all such efforts fail to the dynamics of war, rather than offer hope of a better future.</p> <p>Finding Hope in a Bakery</p> <p>The Foundation for Knowledge and Social Advancement based in Sana’a (capital of Yemen), a charity run and established by Seyed Hassan al Emad, a well-known advocate for peace, opened up a bakery in 2016 with the sole purpose of providing bread to both teachers and students, so that none would go hungry. As of right now the bakery provides bread for 3300 people across the capital every day and serves six schools.</p> <p>Speaking exclusively to Citizen Truth, Seyed Hassan al Emad explained: “Teachers have gone above and beyond the call of duty to offer our youth the education they so desperately deserve and need…, but they are themselves on the verge of famine, and so we had to step in and find a workable solution. So far, we can only offer bread…; hopefully, soon we will create a better structure and offer teachers and students more than the very basics. We believe education to be the cornerstone of democracy; we will do all we can to save our schools.”</p> <p>With no salaries to rely upon for well over a year due to a complete meltdown of the state institutions, teachers have found in the program a veritable life-line – by Catherine Shakdam</p> <p><span><a href="https://citizentruth.org/yemen-under-siege-new-campaign-aims-to-feed-struggling-teachers-students-in-the-name-of-education/">https://citizentruth.org/yemen-under-siege-new-campaign-aims-to-feed-struggling-teachers-students-in-the-name-of-education/</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>In Yemen, Iran-aligned rebels tighten their grip through fear and intimidation</strong></p> <p>When Mohammed Bamuftah arrived at the post office to pick up his salary one day in 2015, he said a rebel fighter stopped him to inspect his ID card. The 55-year-old lawyer was from Aden, where Yemen's internationally recognized government was based. That was enough to get him arrested.</p> <p>By the time Bamuftah emerged from prison three years later, he had suffered shocks from an electric prod, he said. He had been hanged from a ceiling with his hands cuffed for three-hour stretches and beaten with rubber-coated electric cables.</p> <p>"I was in so much pain that I would pass out," recalled Bamuftah, a father of three who was released last summer in a prisoner exchange.</p> <p>But abuses are also being perpetrated by the rebels, known as Houthis. Torture, detentions and forced disappearances are widespread, according to legal documents and interviews with victims and human rights activists. The abuses are fueling an expanding atmosphere of fear and intimidation in this capital and across rebel-controlled areas.</p> <p>The Washington Post reached out to 13 former prisoners and victims of the Houthis. Only four agreed to speak on the record because they and their families had fled the north, where the Houthis are strongest. Those still in Sanaa suspect they are being followed by Houthi intelligence agents. Some victims were afraid to speak even by phone, fearing they were tapped by the rebels.</p> <p>The Houthis have targeted activists, journalists, lawyers, religious minorities, business executives - anyone deemed to be against their rule and ideology. Gunmen have raided homes at night, arresting and beating people over minor disputes or for voicing criticism of their movement. Few face trials or have access to lawyers. Courts are either nonexistent or used purely for sentencing, according to human rights activists and victims.</p> <p>"The Houthis have really gone after a wide spectrum of people who they perceive to be a threat or political opponents to them," said Kristine Beckerle, Yemen researcher for Human Rights Watch. "Now, there's a continuing and increasing crackdown on civil society that is quite troubling."</p> <p>Civil rights lawyers and activists say the abuses have gotten worse since December 2017, when the Houthis killed former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, once their main ally. Today, the guerrilla movement has consolidated its grip over much of northern Yemen, exerting control over every aspect of society.</p> <p>"There is fear across the city," said Abdul Majid Sabra, a lawyer who represents more than four dozen clients, including 10 journalists, held in rebel prisons. "Nobody would dare show what they really feel about the Houthis in public. . . . This is the new reality."</p> <p>In the year since they killed Saleh, the Houthis have tightened their control over Sanaa.</p> <p>Rebel spies are everywhere, in hospitals, hotels and neighborhoods, say aid workers, activists and residents.</p> <p><span>"It's paranoia," Jarhum said.

Why not call them “Houthis”?</span></p> <p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Peace talks in Yemen is destined to fail because of Saudi Arabia and the U.S.</strong></p> <p>Any meaningful peace talks in Yemen is destined to fail due to the wider agenda of regional and international powers, namely Saudi Arabia and the United States</p> <p>The ideal of journalistic objectivity is a mere joke when trying to accurately report about what war in Yemen. An insult to human intelligence and the lives of millions of Yemenis who are suffering in the conflict. Objective journalism has become the total opposite of what it was intended to be. Most “journalist” who are actively covering the war in Yemen, are merely repeating the opinions of the global elite without taking any moral position to check powers, provide context and perspective and pursue the hard truth. Not adhering to these core morals and principles when reporting the war in Yemen will result in journalists becoming a mouthpiece for the hegemonic powers and a conduit for deception. This is why the world today remains in a state of dilemma trying to decipher who is right and who is wrong, who is good and who is bad when it comes to the players on the ground in Yemen.</p> <p>The issue is reporters are desperately trying to maintain the “objective position” they eventually stop telling the truth in fear of being accused of taking sides and being labeled pro-Houthi or pro-Saudi.</p> <p>One of the main reason why the war in Yemen is entering into year five is because of the recycling of misinformation spewed by reporters on the ground and abroad who care more about gaining social media followers then telling the Truth, with a capital T. If your argument is “well no-one really knows what the truth is” then you haven’t done your job as a reporter.</p> <p>To try and shed some light on the overall conflict, here is my assessment of the balance of power in Yemen and why negotiations will ultimately fail. This is based on my research, analysis, opinion and years of experience reporting in Yemen.</p> <p>Why peace negotiations in Yemen will fail</p> <p>Any UN-backed peace deal between Houthis and the government of President Abdrebo Mansour Hadi can and will be used against the Houthi movement to justify military actions against them now or in the future.</p> <p>The conflict in Yemen is not between the Houthis and the “Yemeni government.” Realistically, there is no Yemeni government. The internationally recognized government led by embattled President Abdrebo Mansour Hadi is nothing more than a Saudi political entity that was put in power to maintain and preserve the interests of Saudi Arabia and the western powers just like the previous government of former ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh.</p> <p>The Houthi takeover of the Yemeni capital in 2014 was a direct overthrow of the Saudi backed government. Saudi Arabia reacted the same way it would have if a major Saudi city was taken over by a foreign country. There is no new information here. It is common knowledge that President Abdrebo Mansour Hadi is in the pocket of the Saudi royal family.</p> <p>The Saudi-led coalition’s agenda is to eventually get the Houthis to withdraw their forces from Hodeidah, Taiz, and Sana’a so that the coalition forces can then launch a military offensive by land, air and sea to try and pin the Houthis to the north of the country.</p> <p>The international community recognizes the government of President Mansour Hadi as the legit authority in Yemen. They view the Houthis as an armed rebel movement that took power by force. They also claim the Houthis are an Iranian backed group that takes its orders from Tehran. The United Nations does, however, recognize the Houthis as a political group who have the right to participate in the formation of a new Yemeni government but they should not have their own military that could tip the scale of power.</p> <p>The fact is, the United Nations and the Western-backed Arab states know very well that true power lies with the group who has the military power.</p> <p>The UN and Saudi Arabia are hell-bent on getting that power transformed to a “friendly government” – one that will maintain Saudi and US interests in Yemen.</p> <p>The war is heading into its fifth year because the Houthis don’t seem to play by their rules. The Houthis are defying world powers by sticking to their guns and declaring from day one they will not lay their arms down until Saudi Arabia and its allies accept the new reality in Yemen. And that is the reality of an independent Yemeni nation that calls its own shots, make its own deals and trades and doesn’t answer to the US or Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Whoever controls Hodeidah province will have the upper hand in the war</p> <p>If the Houthis withdraw their forces from Hodeida, it will then be used as another base for coalition forces to advance towards the Yemeni capital and try eliminating the Houthis.</p> <p>The seaport of Hodediah is the economic lifeline for Yemen.</p> <p>The Houthis will not relinquish control of the Yemeni capital</p> <p>The Houthis are prepared for war if negotiations fail. With that in mind, should they compromise military power and control over strategic areas if everything seems to be threading towards a fallout in negotiations? Withdrawing their military forces from Sana’a would be like putting a gun to their head.</p> <p>The Houthis know that Saudi Arabia and its allies will not hesitate for an instant to remove them from power by force if the opportunity grants itself. No matter what happens during negotiations, the Houthis will not hand over their weapons or withdraw from the Yemeni capital. In point blank, unless Saudi Arabia is willing to accept losing control of Yemen the war will continue one way or the other.</p> <p>Iran will support any regime change that is not controlled by Saudi Arabia</p> <p>Iran supported the revolution against Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011 and supported the Houthi revolution against President Abdrebo-Mansour Hadi that began in 2014. But this support was political and through media coverage. There is no evidence to prove that Iran has in any way directly supported the Houthis militarily – by Yousef Mawry</p> <p><span><a href="https://5pillarsuk.com/2018/12/29/peace-talks-in-yemen-is-destined-to-fail-because-of-saudi-arabia-and-the-u-s/">https://5pillarsuk.com/2018/12/29/peace-talks-in-yemen-is-destined-to-fail-because-of-saudi-arabia-and-the-u-s/</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: The author certainly describes the US and Saudi agendas in a correct way.

But hopes remain high that H. Con. Res. 138 will help to end the Yemen war itself. Congressional strategists and activists who have been working on the issue believe passage of the war powers measure will force Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman to the negotiating table.</p> <p>Together, they are challenging the position of some former Obama administration officials who have warned the war powers resolution alone cannot bring the conflict to a close. Those former officials, led by Brookings Institution fellow Bruce Riedel, say that cutting off the Saudi pipeline of spare parts is the only way to prevent further airstrikes, which have been central to the Saudi war strategy.</p> <p>Proponents of the war powers resolution, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, argue the Saudis will not be able to continue the war without the political-diplomatic support of the United States, and the Yemen resolution will make dramatically clear the Saudis can no longer count on U.S. support.</p> <p>The Khashoggi Effect</p> <p>Until 2018, the Obama and Trump administrations had successfully avoided any congressional move to block U.S. support of the Saudi-Emirati bombing of civilian targets in Yemen, or the country’s air and naval blockade. That success was possible, at least in part, because the U.S. media largely ignored the mass starvation of the Yemeni people and <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/12/yemen-cholera-outbreak-worst-in-history-1-million-cases-by-end-of-year">unprecedented cholera epidemic</a></span> these acts of aggression had wrought.</p> <p>The media also failed to report on the United States’ direct role in that conflict</p> <p>But this fall, a tragic event and dramatic revelations created new impetus for a Yemen war powers resolution: Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed</p> <p>The Administration Adjusts Its Yemen Policy</p> <p>The Key to Yemen Peace?</p> <p>The Trump administration’s official <span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sapsj54s_20181128.pdf">position</a></span>, based on the notion that “limited support to member countries of the Emirati and Saudi-led coalition, including intelligence sharing, logistics, and, until recently, aerial refueling” did not constitute being “engaged in hostilities,” was that the resolution had no legal effect. But the activists and congressional staff who worked on the resolution are convinced that the administration’s frantic efforts to prevent its passage reveal just how powerful it will prove.</p> <p>Naiman called the administration’s gambit to head off passage of the resolution “a political signal the whole world sees.” He said he believes “the political-diplomatic signal is even more important than direct military participation.”</p> <p>The war’s swift conclusion appears all but inevitable. While Crown Prince Mohammed may be committed to final victory, the Saudi regime remains heavily dependent on U.S. political-diplomatic cover, as it has since the beginning of the bombing campaign in Yemen.

This strategic waterway links the Mediterranean to South Asia and the Far East, through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.</p> <p>It is a major transit route for oil tankers. A large share of China’s industrial exports to Western Europe transits through this strategic waterway. Maritime trade from East and Southern Africa to Western Europe also transits within proximity of Socotra (Suqutra), through the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. (see map below). A military base in Socotra could be used to oversee the movement of vessels including war ships in an out of the Gulf of Aden.</p> <p>From a military standpoint, the Socotra archipelago is at a strategic maritime crossroads. Morever, the archipelago extends over a relatively large maritime area at the Eastern exit of the Gulf of Aden, from the island of Abd al Kuri, to the main island of Socotra.</p> <p>On January 2nd, 2010, President Saleh and General David Petraeus, Commander of the US Central Command met for high level discussions behind closed doors.</p> <p>Several reports, however, confirmed that the Saleh-Petraeus meetings were intent upon redefining US military involvement in Yemen including the establishment of a full-fledged military base on the island of Socotra. Yemen’s president Ali Abdullah Saleh was reported to have “surrendered Socotra for Americans who would set up a military base, pointing out that U.S. officials and the Yemeni government agreed to set up a military base in Socotra to counter pirates and al-Qaeda.” (<span><a href="http://www.alsahwanet.net/view_nnews.asp?sub_no=402_2010_01_19_75443">Fars News. </a></span>January 19, 2010).</p> <p>The proposed US Socotra military facility, however, is not limited to an air force base.

These will be under U.N. supervision.</p> <p>But the Saudi-led military coalition, which intervened in Yemen in 2015 to restore President Abd-Rabu Mansour Hadi, dismissed the move as it fears that the coastguards may remain loyal to the Houthi-controlled Sanaa government after the withdrawal.</p> <p>“Any redeployment would only be credible if all parties and the United Nations are able to observe and verify that it is in line with the Stockholm Agreement,” the United Nations said in a statement.</p> <p>The United Nations said on Friday both parties had agreed to begin opening humanitarian corridors, starting with the key coastal road between Hodeidah and the Houthi-held capital, Sanaa.</p> <p>However, it said in Sunday’s statement that the opening did not take place. Retired Dutch general Patrick Cammaert, the head of a U.N. advance team charged with monitoring the ceasefire, “expressed his disappointment” in a meeting with the Houthis at the port of Hodeidah on Saturday.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/u-n-says-yemen-houthis-redeployment-in-hodeidah-should-respect-stockholm-deal-idUSKCN1OT0GG">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/u-n-says-yemen-houthis-redeployment-in-hodeidah-should-respect-stockholm-deal-idUSKCN1OT0GG</a></span></p> <p><span>(* A K P)</span></p> <p>UN calls out Yemen’s Houthi rebels over peace gestures</p> <p>The United Nations cast doubt Sunday on claims by Yemen's Shiite rebels to have withdrawn from the Red Sea port of Hodeida, saying such steps can only be credible if all other parties can verify them.</p> <p>Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the rebels, known as Houthis, also failed to honor an agreement to open a "humanitarian" corridor between Hodeida and the capital, Sanaa, to deliver assistance. Both cities are under rebel control.</p> <p>He said retired Dutch Maj. Gen. Patrick Cammaert, who heads a U.N. team of monitors in Hodeida, has expressed his "disappointment at their missed opportunity to build confidence between the parties" in a meeting with rebel representatives about their failure to open the corridor.</p> <p>The Houthis said Saturday they handed over control of the Hodeida port to the coast guard under the Sweden agreement, but the government denied this, saying it was a ploy by the rebels to maintain control. Government officials said the Houthi-appointed commander of the coast guard in Hodeida is a longtime rebel commander who had never served in the coast guard before.</p> <p>The estimated 300 members of Hodeida's coast guard had not reported for work in months and have been replaced by personnel loyal to the Houthis, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.</p> <p>In his meeting with the rebel representatives, Cammaert welcomed the Houthis' efforts to start implementation of the Sweden agreement, but noted that this must be "concurrent," said Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman. The Dutch envoy also emphasized that any redeployment would only be credible if all parties and the U.N. were able to observe and verify it.</p> <p>Cammaert planned to meet Tuesday with representatives of both sides to discuss "the redeployment plans of the parties and the liaison, monitoring and coordination mechanism that will be required to monitor the ceasefire and ensure that credible redeployment is achieved," according to Dujarric.</p> <p><span><a href="https://apnews.com/a1881f6643b043e28ccacb29468eca20">https://apnews.com/a1881f6643b043e28ccacb29468eca20</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/nation-world/world/article223736435.html">https://www.thestate.com/news/nation-world/world/article223736435.html</a></span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(* A K P)</span></p> <p>UN: Houthis Failing to Honor Yemen Agreements</p> <p>A source from the government said that the Houthis had turned against the Redeployment Coordination Committee (RCC), chaired by retired Dutch General, Patrick Cammaert, refuting claims that the militias had started to withdraw from Hodeidah city and its port.<br /> It said that the Houthis were trying to evade the implementation of the Sweden deal through deceiving officials about handing over control of Hodeidah city and its port. <br /> It explained that the militias were misleading officials about their withdrawal by pulling out their forces and later returning them under the guise of policemen or security forces members.</p> <p>The Houthis are making their own interpretation of the Sweden deal whereby they are refusing to hand over control of Hodeidah to local legitimate forces and security agencies that were present there before their 2014 coup.<br /> Sources close to the militias revealed that the agreement to pull out from Hodeidah had sparked disputes among the Houthis.<br /> The militant branch led by Abdulkarim and Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, which includes leading member Abou Ali al-Hakem, has rejected the withdrawal and deemed any cooperation with the Sweden deal as a form of treason.<br /> Head of the Houthis’ so-called ruling council Mahdi Mshat and militia spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam have, however, agreed to cede control of Hodeidah, while ensuring that the militia maintained its financial interests.</p> <p><span><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1525141/un-houthis-failing-honor-yemen-agreements">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1525141/un-houthis-failing-honor-yemen-agreements</a></span></p> <p><span>and</span></p> <p><span>(* A K P)</span></p> <p>UN calls out Houthi rebels over Hodeidah peace plan</p> <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels are not committing to a full withdrawal from the port city of Hodeidah, government and military officials have told <em>The National</em>.</p> <p>Their alleged withdrawal "is a blatant act and ploy against the United Nations and the international community,” said the official, in reference to the rebel group's claim they had handed over control of the main port in the Red Sea city.</p> <p>According to Yemeni government officials, Houthi rebels have disguised loyal administrators and fighters in government military and guard fatigues and deployed them to the city and its three ports.</p> <p>Brigadier Yehya Abu Hatim, a senior commander in the Yemeni military, said the rebels were masquerading as guards of the city in a bid to keep fighters there.</p> <p>“The force that the Houthis claim is the Coast Guards are their fighters in reality.

Girls are often sent away to <a href="https://www.unfpa.org/news/families-increasingly-resort-child-marriage-yemen%E2%80%99s-conflict-grinds">marry</a> at ages as young as 13. However, one school in the capital Sana'a found a modest, yet effective, form of relief.</p> <p>The NGO <a href="http://www.solidariosinfronteras.org/">Solidarios sin Fronteras</a> (based in Spain and Yemen) run almost entirely by volunteers and funded primarily by <a href="https://www.teaming.net/solidariossinfronteras-desayunosparaeducaryprotegerenyemen-?lang=es_ES">individual donations</a> — some as small as one euro per month—, has started to provide a complete breakfast for this school's girl students, who are aged six to 16. Before the project began, one-fifth of them had been absent. Little by little, they started to come back and, since September 2018, all 525 students are regularly attending classes, Solidarios’ founders say.</p> <p>I've spoken via Whatsapp with two of the NGO's founders, Eva, who I had previously met in person some years ago in Barcelona, and Faten, who is in Yemen. They told me about how their project <a href="http://www.solidariosinfronteras.org/educacion/">“Breakfasts to educate and protect”</a> came about. They also asked me to not disclose their full names or the name of the school for security concerns.</p> <p>The three women are a volunteer executive team and count with support from trusted volunteers in both countries. Eva and Noèlia, who are based in Spain, take care of fundraising: they rely on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/solidariosinfronteras/">social media</a>, <a href="https://www.ivoox.com/entrevista-a-eva-erill-noelia-ruiz-de-audios-mp3_rf_23309894_1.html">radio</a>, the <a href="https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/20160614/eva-erill-un-like-no-da-agua-a-un-nino-refugiado-un-euro-si-5206002">print press</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=U7nCteNWQXY">lectures</a> to spread the word about their work and attract contributors. Most people donate online and SSF crowdfunds each project separately. Faten is responsible for administering the ground operations — often from her own house. The three of them make up the executive team and juggle their tasks in the NGO with their daily jobs.</p> <p>They regularly <a href="https://www.instagram.com/solidariosinfronteras/">share photographs</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/solidariosinfronteras">videos</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/solidariosSF">detailed updates</a> on the SSF's social media pages.

What did really change???</span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p>Oxfam America President Abby Maxman: My holiday wish for the people of Yemen</p> <p>As the year winds down, I can’t help but think of the families I met in Yemen earlier this year. I wonder, and worry, about how they’re coping.</p> <p>As a mother of three children, I am ever-grateful for our many privileges—shelter from the cold, safety and freedom of movement, plentiful and nutritious food. As I think of my time in Yemen, a country ravaged by years of war yet full of resilient, caring people who share similar hopes and dreams as me and my family, I am pained knowing that more than half a million Yemenis are facing famine and freezing winter temperatures. Many live in makeshift shelters without insulation or enough to eat and fear the resumption of bombing and conflict each day.</p> <p>As I write this, there are parents like me making unimaginable choices—desperate to save their children’s lives however they can.</p> <p>I recall hearing the faded dreams of girls I met—a few years ago, they were working hard to get ahead in school with aspirations for their future; now they face being sold into early marriage to keep their parents and siblings alive. The faded dreams of boys sent off to fight—boy soldiers offered what is now the only "reliable" source of income to buy food for their families or gain access to the most rudimentary medical care. With so many schools damaged or destroyed by the Houthis and the US-supported, Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition, for many it seems like these are the best or only options.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/stories/my-holiday-wish-for-the-people-of-yemen/">https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/stories/my-holiday-wish-for-the-people-of-yemen/</a></span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p>Recipient in Yemen: “You saved us from a slow death.”</p> <p>Yemenis are in urgent need of food, water, and other aid.

Many have been trapped in conflict-affected locations and are at risk for living in damaged shelters and unfinished buildings. Their degree of resilience and positive coping mechanism have reduced due to the protracted nature of the conflict. The ability to provide their basic household needs have decreased due to the economic recession that left hundred thousands of Yemeni people unemployed. Salaries for health facility staff, teachers and other public sector workers go increasingly unpaid, leaving 1.25 million state employees and their 6.9 million dependents or nearly 30 per cent of the population without an income at a time of shortages and rising prices.<br /> As of 1 August 2018, the Task Force for Population Movement (TFPM) which is a Technical Working Group to the Inter-Cluster Coordination Mechanism (ICCM) has identified, 2,331,264 internally displaced persons (IDPs) (388,544 households) who have been displaced due to conflict and natural disasters since March 2015, dispersed across 22 governorates. The current number of displaced persons represent 7% of total Yemeni population based on Yemen’s pre-crisis population of 28,923,127 individuals.<br /> The majority of IDPs are living with host.<br /> For the same period, the TFPM has identified 1,012,464 returnees (168,744 households), across 22 governorates. The majority of returnees are residing in their original house of habitual residence.<br /> Immediate emergency assistance for newly displaced families remains a significant challenge as the majority of displaced families tend to live in precarious situations for several weeks before basic emergency shelter and NFI assistance can be provided. Majority of IDPs in Yemen are living with host families but displacement already lasted longer than anticipated, resources run out and the capacity of host families is extremely stretched.

Some comments on his Twitter page reveal little information on possibly important conversations, such as on Nov. 21, when Hadi sent “a message of thanks to Saudi and UAE leadership.”</p> <p>Hadi appears well in recent official tweets, although in October and November, he looked overweight and puffy. On Oct. 2, he called Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia — the same day that Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.</p> <p>The relationship between Yemen, a resilient country that shares a long northern border with Saudi Arabia, has a history of “extensive social, religious and business ties” with its neighbor, according to a <span><a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08SANAA1053_a.html">Wikileaks cable</a></span> of June 18, 2008, written by a State Department official. A summary of the relationship and more details are explained under the cable’s heading, “Yemen’s Big Brother: What Has Saudi Arabia Done for Yemen Lately?”</p> <p>The cable describes a relationship that Yemenis perceive “as heavily balanced in favor of Saudi Arabia, which remains involved in Yemen, to the extent necessary, to counter the potential threat of Yemen’s unemployed masses, poor security, unrest, crime and the intentions of foreign countries (Libya and Iran) that might create a threat on Saudi Arabia’s southern border.</p> <p>Yemen, on the other hand, growls at the hand that might feed it. . . . Consequently, Yemen has, on occasion, swallowed its resentment and acquiesced to Saudi wishes.”</p> <p>How Hadi affords to travel to Cleveland and pay for his medical care there remains a mystery, as his country is cited as the poorest in the region. His country is also on the list of those denied visas into the US, through a Trump White House order. Most likely, he received a diplomatic visa as a head of state.</p> <p>Back in Riyadh, Hadi is administering to the remains of his ruined, subjugated country, while the UN tries to end the worst humanitarian disaster in the world.</p> <p>As the 2008 cable on Wikileaks said, “The USG [US government] advocacy, however, must be tempered to ensure that Saudi Arabia knows the USG does not/not aim to make Yemen a vassal state.”</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.passblue.com/2018/12/31/as-his-country-wages-war-president-hadi-of-yemen-still-travels-to-us-for-health-care/">https://www.passblue.com/2018/12/31/as-his-country-wages-war-president-hadi-of-yemen-still-travels-to-us-for-health-care/</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: Saudis and US will do everything to keep Hadi alive.

The Al Saud, the royal family, had functioned as an oligarchy, but King Salman and his hyperactive son have concentrated power in their hands in an unprecedented fashion.</p> <p>The new crew is impatient, grasping and brutally direct.</p> <p>Bin Salman, in a hurry to be an absolute monarch, is paranoid about Iran’s populist, republican Khomeinism on the one hand, and the populist, republican Muslim Brotherhood on the other. Saudi Arabia has richly rewarded Egypt’s officer corps for crushing the Muslim Brotherhood in that country.</p> <p>In June of 2017 Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates sprang a boycott on neighboring Qatar and may have planned an invasion, over Doha’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood and its correct relations with Iran.</p> <p>Bin Salman put together an anti-Iran, anti-Muslim Brotherhood alliance of Israel, Egypt, the UAE, and Bahrain in the region, backed by the Neoconservatives in Trump’s administration such as John Bolton and Mike Pompeo.</p> <p>Then on October 2, 2018, the whole thing unraveled.

Die Ergebnisse sind entsprechend - man spricht sich selbst frei u. färbt schön</p> <p>Die saudische Koalition hatte eine eigene "Ermittlungsgruppe" eingerichtet, um zu verhindern, dass die UNO eine unabhängige internationale Untersuchung der Kriegsverbrechen im Jemen-Krieg veranlasst. Der UN-Menschenrechtsausschuss, humanitäre Organisationen der Vereinten Nationen, humanitäre und andere NGOs, Politiker und Aktivisten weltweit hatten um eine solche Untersuchung gebeten. Das forderten sogar die Huthis, obwohl sie selbst dann wegen der zahlreichen von ihnen selbst begangenen Kriegsverbrechen angeklagt worden wären.</p> <p>Der saudischen Koalition gelang es jedoch, all diese Bemühungen zu blockieren, wobei sie von ihren Verbündeten im UN-Sicherheitsrat, den USA, Großbritannien und Frankreich intensiv unterstützt wurden. Dies ist ein Skandal an sich und ein weiterer Beweis für eine westliche Mittäterschaft; ein Skandal, der deutlich zeigt, wer die Haupttäter in diesem Krieg sind.</p> <p>Am 25. Dezember 2018 veröffentlichte JIAT einen weiteren Untersuchungsbericht. Der Luftangriff vom 9. Mai im Gebiet von Dhahian (Nummer 115) wurde auf folgende Weise beschrieben (<a href="http://wam.ae/de/details/1395302729110">http://wam.ae/de/details/1395302729110</a> ):</p> <p><em>JIAT stellte fest, dass die Koalitionsstreitkräfte Informationen erhalten hatten, aus denen hervorging, dass ein Gebäude als Befehlszentrale und Versorgungspunkt für die Frontlinien der bewaffneten Huthi-Milizen mit Waffen, Munition und Körperwärme-Raketen in Alab - Al Rabow'ah, 37 Kilometer von der internationalen Grenze zu Saudi-Arabien entfernt. Es wurde als legitimes militärisches Ziel eingeschätzt, dessen Zerstörung einen eindeutigen militärischen Vorteil bietet.

Doch, daß Versender der Hilfsgüter marodierende Parteien im Jemen um Verteilung der Hilfsgüter bitten, ist der Hohn schlecht hin. Weder kann sendenden Regierungen und Orgs. Sittlichkeit der Streitmächte und Allgemeinheit in Empfängerland entgangen sein, noch fehlt es ihnen an immer gleicher Erfahrung. Und wenn daran gelegen wäre, daß Güter einmal möglichst vollständig an Bedürftige gingen, stellte man sich nicht hin und verkündete, im Jemen lediglich Verbleib von 20% der Hilfsgüter kontrollieren zu können. Seit 40 / 50 oder mehr Jahren geht es nun so mit "Entwicklungshilfe" und Hilfslieferungen. Daß dies unverändert so bleibt liegt an Kungelei mit lokalen Stammesfürsten und Herrschern, die sich reichlich bedienen dürfen, sowie an von eben Diesen arrangierten Kickbacks jener Gelder, die aus öffentlichem Fundus ausgesendet wurden, um zum Teil in private Taschen der Initiatoren zurückzukehren. Es liegt auf der Hand. Wenn man in authentischer Absicht zur Hilfe etwa zu dem Schluß kommt, lediglich Bruchteil einer Sendung kontrollieren zu können, verwendet man eben soviel auf vorbereitende und prophylaktische Maßnahmen, bis man bei nahe an 100% angelangt ist, BEVOR man Güter und Gelder sendet. Punkt. Inzwischen ist die abzockende Routine ein uralter, unablässiger Hut. Und wenn dieser Dank kreuzbuckelnd-ergebenster Medienlandschaft unterm Teppich bleibt, wird sich auch weiterhin nichts daran ändern; egal wieviel Tote es bedeutet. Wenn sich indessen jemals etwas ändert, könnte man z.B. vielleicht doch endlich einmal jenen 8 Mrd. Dollar nachspüren, die als Wiederaufbaugelder für den Irak in der UNO spurlos verschwunden sind. Man muß sich einmal vor Augen führen, was es bedeutet, wenn solche Beträge überhaupt "verlustig gehen" können; geschweige denn, ohne Ahndung bleiben.(!!) Wer denn ehemaligen SPIEGEL lesen pflegte, weiß, was für halbseidene Bagage an Spezis in die leitenden Etagen der UNO und deren reinwaschenden Heiligenschein abgeseilt wird. Man muß aber auch nicht erst so tiefgründig informiert sein, um zu realisieren, daß nur Sedierte Hochrangige Institutionen beim jeweiligen Titel für bare Münze nehmen. Korruption und Schattenreich regiert die Welt. Zwangsläufig, wo Kapitalismus herrscht. Das sollte noch so schlichtem Gemüt bereits Name dieser Wirtschaftsmethode offenbaren. Es sei denn: A) Man wird als fragile Persönlichkeit von psychologischem Selbstschutz bestimmt. B) Man sucht als Nutznießer seine Rechtfertigung. Gleichfalls: Punkt.</p></div>
