It was prompted by an increasing number of reports of humanitarian food for sale on the open market in the capital. What the checks unearthed was fraud being perpetrated by at least one local partner organisation tasked by WFP with handling and distributing its food assistance.”</p> <p>Even as the theft of food aid was being reported, other agencies operating in Yemen were warning privately that they believed a more widespread diversion of aid might be taking place, raising serious questions over the effectiveness and vulnerability of the UN’s famine early-warning mechanism known as the Integrated Phase Classification system [IPC].</p> <p>One senior aid official told the Guardian they believed that the IPC itself could have been manipulated to the benefit of Houthi-controlled areas and to the detriment of starving civilians in other parts of the country.</p> <p>The official, who did not want to be named, said: “The reason I don’t believe the IPC figures is because they have been manipulated by political parties. And we have been a party to it. The [food security] surveys have been limited or only done by certain entities.</p> <p>“If you look at the data, we have certain governorates [administrative divisions] that belong to a specific party to the conflict [that have the most need]. The data collection on acute malnutrition in Yemen is a disaster. Even if the UN agencies say it is under control, it is not.”</p> <p>Commenting on the latest claims of the diversion of food aid, a spokesman for WFP said: “So far, our monitoring has identified seven food distribution centres which we believe have been engaging in the misappropriation of our food stocks. These centres, located in Sana’a, are overseen by one of our local partner organisations affiliated with the Houthi administration in the capital.</p> <p>“For now, we cannot confirm the exact amount of relief food that is being diverted in Yemen.” – by Peter Beaumont</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/02/aid-officials-aware-for-months-of-widespread-food-aid-theft-in-yemen">https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/02/aid-officials-aware-for-months-of-widespread-food-aid-theft-in-yemen</a></span></p> <p>and</p> <p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p> <p><strong>The ‘abuse of food relief in Yemen’ must end now</strong></p> <p>WFP’s demands were issued in a letter to the Houthi leadership as well as in a news release on New Year’s Eve.</p> <p>“This is an issue that affects not just WFP but all aid agencies working in Yemen and indeed in war zones everywhere and no-one can say for certain how widespread this problem is”, said WFP spokesperson Hervé Verhoosel, noting that humanitarian food assistance was being diverted in Houthi-controlled areas, including the capital of Sana’a, and, to a lesser extent, in the Government-controlled areas as well.</p> <p>According to news reports, factions and militias on both sides of the conflict have blocked food aid from reaching groups suspected of disloyalty, diverting it instead to front-line combat units or selling it for a profit on the black market.</p> <p>The UN agency has learned that many desperately poor people have taken to selling part of their food rations for education, medicines and rent.</p> <p>The Yemen Government gave WFP permission to biometrically register beneficiaries, by identifying and authenticating each individual based on person-specific data.</p> <p>So far, WFP monitoring has identified seven centres in Sana’a city where an estimated 1,200 metric tons of food was diverted in August and September, equivalent to about one per cent of the food provided nationally each month.</p> <p>“It is our monitoring systems that detected there was a problem”, Mr. Verhoosel explained. “We are committed to ensuring our food assistance reaches those who most need it.”</p> <p>As the local partner organization involved in the abuse has at the same time helped provide food assistance to three million people, WFP underscored that the authorities must investigate and dismiss those responsible, regardless of whether the corruption was carried out by the Government or non-governmental organizations. </p> <p> “To improve the support to beneficiaries, we have been looking into the introduction of cash-based transfers in some areas”, said Mr. Verhoosel. “However, given the risk of corruption, we have made it clear to the de facto authorities that we will not introduce cash-based transfers unless we are authorized to implement a biometric identification system that uses personal data, including iris scans and ten-finger prints”.</p> <p>WFP is tackling the issue by tracking and monitoring suspected locations and closely inspecting distribution centres.</p> <p>“The de facto authorities in Sana’a have a responsibility to take action against those involved in stealing from the beneficiaries and in trading of food aid,” he stressed. “They should allow an independent beneficiary selection process and a biometric-based registration system.”</p> <p>Mr. Verhoosel said that the biometric identification system had been rolled out in Government-controlled areas and that authorities in Sana’a had yet to agree to implement the system.</p> <p><a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1029852">https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1029852</a></p> <p>and</p> <p>(* A H P)</p> <p>WFP welcomes Houthi probe into Yemen food theft</p> <p>The United Nations food agency says it welcomes a statement from Yemen's Houthi rebel leadership saying they will investigate theft and other abuses related to food relief to the impoverished country.</p> <p>Herve Verhoosel, spokesman for the World Food Program, told reporters Friday in Geneva that misuse of food aid also happens in areas controlled by the government but that it is of "lower volume."</p> <p>"This is an issue that affects not just WFP but all aid agencies working in Yemen and indeed in war zones everywhere," he said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20190104/news/301049959">https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20190104/news/301049959</a></p> <p>and</p> <p><strong>(** A H P)</strong></p> <p><strong>World Food Program, Bribed By Saudis, Threatens Yemenis With More Famine</strong></p> <p>The United Nation's World Food Program is supposed to relief populations in urgent need of food supplies. It is not supposed to be a partisan organization. But in the war on Yemen it has now taken one side of the conflict and is threatening the other side with starvation.</p> <p>The slow famine in Yemen continues unabated. Not only the people in north Yemen, under control of the Houthi and besieged by the Saudi coalition, are starving. </p> <p>Just yesterday <em>AP</em> and the <em>Pulitzer Center</em> published an <span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/bcf4e7595b554029bcd372cb129c49ab">investigative report</a></span> on how food supplies delivered by aid agencies gets pilfered during its distribution in Yemen</p> <p>But the UN ignored the <em>AP</em> report that both sides are looting food aid. Just hours after it was published the UN's World Food Program <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-middle-east-46722502">exclusively accused</a></span> the Houthi side of diverting aid.</p> <p>Just like the Saudis, the UN's WFP <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/yemen-houthis-deny-wfp-accusations-stealing-aid-190101152046453.html">threatens to starve</a></span> the people who live in Houthi controlled area:</p> <p>"If you don't act within 10 days, WFP will have no choice but to suspend the assistance ... that goes to nearly three million people," the letter said.</p> <p>The Houthi <span><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/yemen-rebels-deny-un-accusations-stealing-aid-deliveries-105755085.html">protest against</a></span> such a partisan ultimatum</p> <p>The threat from the WFP is outrageous. "We will let 3 million people die unless you do this or that" is not the way the UN should talk to the weaker side of a conflict. (Curiously the @WFP_Yemen twitter account has now been shut down.)</p> <p>The Saudis and the UAE use their purse string to influence the WFP. Two month ago they pledge another $500 million.</p> <p>“What Yemen needs most is peace because that would make the greatest amount of difference in every Yemeni life,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “In the meantime, this important donation will help us save children on the brink of death. I thank the UAE and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for a contribution that will truly save lives.”</p> <p>I find it inconceivable the that UN or its sub-organizations take large amounts of Saudi money to prevent a famine that the Saudis willingly cause in the first place. The UN should reject such bribery. To then threaten the starving side of the conflict to withhold aid over distribution problems is reckless.</p> <p>WFP Director David Beasley, a former governor of South Carolina nominated for the WFP job by U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, should be suspended from his job. His partisan behavior is exactly the reason why the Houthi can not and will not give the UN or any of its organizations full control over Hodeidah. It is the only port through which they can receive food supplies for the people living in their area. If UN organizations that are obviously influenced by Saudi money and issues partisan threats get control over the port, the siege on the Houthi areas would be complete.</p> <p>Sooner or later they would have to concede their defeat. By then millions more would have died.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.moonofalabama.org/2019/01/saudi-bribed-un-world-food-program-threatens-yemenis-with-more-famine.html">https://www.moonofalabama.org/2019/01/saudi-bribed-un-world-food-program-threatens-yemenis-with-more-famine.html</a></span></p> <p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p> <p><strong>War on Yemen: It’s Now About Snatching Food Aid from the Starving</strong></p> <p>The outrageous Saudi-led war on Yemen is all about starving a nation and stealing its riches, where Western aid is eclipsed by the billions brought in through the bungling, deceitful sale of weapons to Saudis and their allies.</p> <p>While the world celebrates the New Year, report after report reveal that amid famine and rampant disease, food aid pouring in from across the globe, meant to curb the world's worst humanitarian crisis, is in fact "being snatched from the starving" by armed forces allied with the US-backed, Saudi-led coalition.</p> <p>The warmongers block food aid from going to the besieged areas, divert it to front-line combat units, or sell it for profit on the black market. The United Nations and observers on the ground attribute the near-famine conditions in much of the country to the Saudi blockade of ports.</p> <p>The UN World Food Program says it has already documented food aid diversion "at a time when children are dying in Yemen because they haven't enough food to eat; that is an outrage." Save the Children also says some 85,000 children under age five have starved to death since the brutal war began.</p> <p>This shouldn’t happen at a time when peace talks and a ceasefire agreement are still in place. The talks in Sweden have led to a reduction in fighting and this should ease the challenges of getting food aid into and out of Hodeida, the port city that is a gateway to the north. Donors should be able to get more food in.

We don’t need the Saudis,” said a former deputy governor of Al-Mahra, Ali bin Salem Al-Huraizy, who has helped organize protests over the Saudi presence in the province.</p> <p>Brig. Gen. Ali Shekri, commander of the Saudi task force in Al-Mahra, said the Saudi-development initiatives are intended to cultivate goodwill and meet local needs before a rival, such as an Iran-backed rebel group or <span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/yemens-war-opens-way-for-al-qaedas-revival-1542895200?mod=article_inline">Islamic extremists like al Qaeda</a></span>, decides to do so.</p> <p>While Al-Mahra province has avoided much of the destruction seen elsewhere in Yemen, the province is symptomatic of how locals bristle over the outsize role of regional powers.</p> <p>Since April, hundreds of people have demonstrated regularly against the takeover by Saudi “invaders.” In November, Saudi-backed Yemeni soldiers killed at least two people when they opened fire on a demonstration.</p> <p>The Saudi-backed governor of Al-Mahra province, Rajeh Saidbakrit, said those killed were terrorists who were shot while attacking a checkpoint. But Mr. Huraizy said those killed were ordinary protesters.</p> <p>In Ghaydah, the Saudis use the airport, which they seized in late 2017, to fly soldiers in and out of the country.

Pentagon: LOL</strong></p> <p>The resolution was largely symbolic (GOP leaders blocked the House from taking up any Yemen-related legislation for the rest of the year), and the US Air Force today (Jan. 3) issued a request seeking suppliers to provide airplane parts—horizontal stabilizers, fuel lines, circuit-card assemblies, air inlets—to keep Saudi F-15 jet fighters flying.</p> <p>“This solicitation provides a direct counter to the claims the US makes at times, that if the US didn’t sell weapons to Saudi Arabia, Russia and China will,” Andrea Prasow, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch, told Quartz. “But these weapons systems are all from US manufacturers and they require US parts, and they can’t get those from Russia or China. It’s useful for people to understand that even if Congress were to ban sales [to Saudi] tomorrow, it wouldn’t significantly alter the defense industry’s relationship with Saudi Arabia.”</p> <p>Saudi Arabia has the third-largest fleet of F-15s in the world, behind only the US and Israel.</p> <p>“The Saudis have prosecuted the war in Yemen with little regard for the United States’ views while simultaneously demanding the Pentagon’s logistical support and the uninterrupted flow of munitions,” Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations <span><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/27/america-is-not-an-innocent-bystander-in-yemen/">wrote recently</a></span>.</p> <p>It would be difficult to impose restrictions on Saudi Arabia use of US-supplied materiel writ large, said Scott Paul, Oxfam America senior humanitarian policy advisor.</p> <p>“If your existing contract is for horizontal stabilizers for F-15s, how do you legislate that? Yes, it’s OK to provide horizontal stabilizers for F-15s if they’re not fighting in Yemen?” he told Quartz. “Members [of Congress] have been uneasy writing off entire defense contracts with the Saudis. They would rather find a more precise way to extract the US from its role in the conflict in Yemen.”</p> <p>The public conversation around the US-Saudi defense relationship has made it out to be an all-or-nothing proposition. The F-15 procurement notice shows a bit of the “humdrum, everyday foundational piece that isn’t really entering the conversation,” Paul said. Military cooperation with Saudi Arabia will certainly continue in a broad sense, especially as the US has <span><a href="https://militarybases.com/overseas/saudi-arabia/">five strategic bases in the kingdom.</a></span> However, he continued, “there are a lot of people who take exception to the fact that this alliance is uncontroversial.”</p> <p>Some legislators are now “trying to reshape the defense relationship around shared interests as opposed to a blank check,” said Paul.</p> <p>Nevertheless, said Andrea Prasow, “This administration doesn’t intend to change its relationship with Saudi Arabia.” – by Justin Rohrlich</p> <p><span><a href="https://qz.com/1514582/us-supports-saudi-war-in-yemen-even-after-senate-votes-no/">https://qz.com/1514582/us-supports-saudi-war-in-yemen-even-after-senate-votes-no/</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>Cholera is accelerating again in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a> with about 10K suspected cases now per week-double the average for first 8 months of 2018</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/AdelHa11/status/1081252761860231169">https://twitter.com/AdelHa11/status/1081252761860231169</a></p> <p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p> <p><strong>2018 Was Disaster for Yemeni Children With Continuation of Aggression and Siege</strong></p> <p>The spokesman for the Yemeni Ministry of Public Health and Population said that 2018 was a terrifying nightmare for the children in Yemen where tens of thousands of them lost their lives for several reasons, including the direct bombing of the US-Saudi aerial aggression or indirect (siege and health effects on them).</p> <p>The spokesman of the Ministry of Public Health and Population, Yousef Al-Hadhari, revealed some of the figures of children's tragedies in Yemen in 2018, as follows:</p> <p>- Ministry of Health recorded 203297 children under the age of five years have malaria as a new injury added to the previous figures for previous years, the province of Hodeidah in the forefront of the most affected provinces of malaria and then the province of Hajja and Taiz.</p> <p>- A child dies every 10 minutes due to malnutrition or other diseases (according to a UN report issued in September 2018).</p> <p>- About 1203 children have been infected with Maltese fever, Dhamar, then the capital, comes on the list of the most affected.</p> <p>- About 981 children were infected in 2018 with rabies.

Furthermore, we show that the isolates from Yemen are susceptible to several antibiotics that are commonly used to treat cholera and to polymyxin B, resistance to which is used as a marker of the El Tor biotype.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0818-3">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0818-3</a></span></p> <p>and also <span><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-01-mystery-yemen-cholera-epidemic.html">https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-01-mystery-yemen-cholera-epidemic.html</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190102140745.htm">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190102140745.htm</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/cholera-strain-behind-epidemic-yemen-sequenced#.XC2fl1xKiUk">https://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/cholera-strain-behind-epidemic-yemen-sequenced#.XC2fl1xKiUk</a></span></p> <p>and</p> <p>(* B H)</p> <p>Doctors I met at cholera treatment centre in Aden in 2017 claimed 1st reported cases came from a migrant detention facility with squalid living conditions and no sanitation.

The situation has been exacerbated by the collapse of the national currency, lack of salaries for civil servants for two and a half years, and misappropriation of aid by some armed groups.</p> <p>Kickstarting the economy is a key step. The dedicated young Yemenis behind the Small and Micro Enterprise Promotion Service (SMEPS) of the Social Fund for Development prove progress is possible. By providing small grants to entrepreneurs, including farmers and fishermen, SMEPS has created over 65,000 jobs since 2017, nearly one third to women.</p> <p>The international community should also focus on promoting governance, rule of law, and professionalising local forces responsible for security in areas where fighting has stopped.

Seeing as the two have been rivals for decades, hope for peace rests upon the conflict becoming more of a burden that a benefit for one of the powers, forcing them to withdraw. This may be the case with Saudi Arabia, which currently facing massive pressure from friends in the West to withdraw.</p> <p>While it is still too early to consider this cease-fire as a certain sign of peace, it could be seen as a litmus test where the Saudis will draw the line in order to retain foreign aid and investment. With talks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/14/yemen-ceasefire-hope-gives-way-to-concerns-about-implementation">coming up in January </a>about the next step in the peace process, the best hope for those facing famine is that the Senate stands strong behind its threat and that the Saudis are forced to limit their involvement in the civil war.</p> <p>While a Saudi exit from the war would certainly not end it – it would in no way remedy the discordant objectives between the government forces and the Houthi rebels – it would likely play a large role in decreasing the starvation faced by millions of Yemenis.

Tight blockades, stringent import restrictions and withholding the salaries of about a million civil servants have landed on the backs of civilians, laying the economy to waste and driving millions deeper into poverty.</p> <p>– Infrastructure destroyed, jobs lost, a weakening currency and soaring prices are the clear results.

Children work with physical therapists who help them learn how to use their new prostheses. Progress can be slow, but the children are eager and determined. In 2018, 98 children received treatment at the center.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/unicefusa/2019/01/04/helping-yemens-children-heal-from-the-wounds-of-war/#4185d99713f2">https://www.forbes.com/sites/unicefusa/2019/01/04/helping-yemens-children-heal-from-the-wounds-of-war/#4185d99713f2</a> </span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Saada?src=hash">#Saada</a> is the greenhouse centre of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a> <span>boasting 42,000 plastic enclosed gardens.

Do you know the date you were born? Are these data included in your identification? Then you are privileged compared to the children in Yemen. Nearly 83% of the children in the country do not have a birth certificate, which means they have no legal identity, no right to a name, nationality or family relations. This makes them invisible to the world.</p> <p>Not having a registration affects particularly children from displaced or marginalised communities, who are already suffering from various other forms of discrimination. For Ali Nasr and other many children, this has recently changed, the young 5-year old boy from a marginalized community, the Muhamasheen, received his birth certificate on 3rd December 2018.</p> <p>One of the key activities carried out by UNICEF’s Child Protection programme in the country, is to support birth registration. Every year, there are over 900,000 new-born babies across Yemen, but those registered still remain a few.</p> <p>A birth certificate is a passport to citizenship and participation in society, and the foundation for the realization of many other human rights integral to a child’s development, protection and well-being.</p> <p>Without birth registration, children’s access to basic social services such as education and health care may be at risk. That’s why UNICEF and its contributing donors are intervening to make sure that children in Yemen can have access to this fundamental right.</p> <p>Through its Child Protection programme, UNICEF, with the support of the local authorities and its implementing partners, targets the most vulnerable children in conflict-affected areas of Yemen with interventions including victim assistance, family tracing and reunification, documentation of child rights violations and referrals to child protection services.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/yemen/reallives_12811.html">https://www.unicef.org/yemen/reallives_12811.html</a></span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p><span>Film: </span>Jemen Nothilfe 2019 musaid e.V.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8xCX2otd8Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8xCX2otd8Y</a></span></p> <p><span>(B H)</span></p> <p>Viele Mädchen werden im Jemen viel zu früh verheiratet.

By monitoring new displacement and working with service providers, community centres and community leaders, UNHCR and its partners identified and assessed the needs of over 160,000 vulnerable households. UNHCR cash assistance targeted people with specific protection needs and those lacking adequate shelter or the key materials to keep warm, particularly during winter. Cash will remain at the forefront of UNHCR’s assistance in Yemen in 2019.</p> <p>UNHCR provided core relief items (CRI) – such as mattresses, blankets and other household items – to over 700,000 individuals, and provided emergency shelter kits (ESK) to 125,000 people. In-kind distributions provide essential support to IDPs, returnees and heavily burdened host communities, especially where the scale of displacement and intensity of fighting make such items unavailable or inaccessible in local markets. </p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unhcr-yemen-2018-overview">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unhcr-yemen-2018-overview</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span>Film: </span>Footage here showing the real situation of displaced families in Abs displaced camp in Hajjah.

According to <em>Al Jazeera</em>, “A royal decree was issued on Wednesday to demote outgoing chief diplomat Adel Al-Jubeir to the position of Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and named Ibrahim Al-Assaf as his replacement.”</p> <p><span>This is an extremely crucial turn of events, as it will have an impact on Saudi Arabia’s ability to communicate its foreign relations policies to the world. Al-Jubeir was perhaps one of the most powerful foreign ministers ever employed by Riyadh. He served not only as foreign minister but also as a de facto “chief spin doctor” using his emotionless, soft voice to defend his country’s decisions whenever required.</span></p> <p>In the end, Al-Jubeir appears to have been betrayed by the very regime that he tried so hard to defend. His demotion is seen by most commentators as the need for a scapegoat for the Khashoggi murder and the negative publicity that followed. However, the downgrading from minister to minister of state in the same department might prove to be disastrous for Saudi Arabia. As well as the Khashoggi issue, Al-Jubeir has been a leading talking head in the media to explain Saudi foreign policy on Yemen and the blockade of Qatar.</p> <p><span>A change of foreign ministers often indicates an imminent change of foreign policy; is this going to happen in this case? Adel Al-Jubeir has been the face of Saudi Arabia’s much-criticised foreign policy during the most tumultuous political period in the Kingdom’s history.

Seine Außenpolitik ist bestimmt von einer pathologischen Iran-Obsession, die – genau wie der post-9/11 Dilettantismus des Westens in der Region – den Iran jedes Mal stärker macht, anstatt ihn zu schwächen.</p> <p>Auch verfolgt das Königreich traditionell eine eher zurückhaltende Außenpolitik. Allzu offene Aggression fernab der Landesgrenzen wurde zumeist durch subtile Einflussnahme und exzessive Scheckbuch-Diplomatie ersetzt.</p> <p>All dies änderte sich grundlegend mit dem beispiellosen Aufstieg des Mohammed bin Salman, genannt MbS, beginnend vor gerade einmal vier Jahren. Sein Vater König Salman zeigt sich nur selten, setzt kaum Akzente – die Macht im Staate liegt beim 33-jährigen Prinzen. Nahezu sämtliches Handeln des MbS bewegt sich dabei in regelrechter Obsession zwischen zwei grundlegenden Motiven: im Innern die maximale Konzentration von Macht in seinen Händen, nach außen die hochgefährliche Konfrontation mit seiner vermeintlichen Nemesis Iran.</p> <p>Palastrevolution in drei Akten</p> <p>Nach verschiedenen kommunalen und Beratertätigkeiten begann MbS‘ politischer Aufstieg mit dem Tod von König Abdullah im Januar 2015.

<p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Khashoggi murder: Book reveals 'new details' about killing</strong></p> <p>Written by Turkish journalists, the book purports to shed light on events that led to Khashoggi's murder and aftermath.</p> <p>Almost three months after the killing of Saudi writer<span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/jamal-khashoggi.html">Jamal Khashoggi</a></span> in his country's consulate in Istanbul, a new book reveals further details about the murder, the Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah reported.</p> <p>Titled "Diplomatic Atrocity: The Dark Secrets of the Khashoggi Murder", the book, written by two Daily Sabah journalists, purports to shed light on the events that led to the writer's murder and what transpired in the aftermath.</p> <p>Among the reported revelations in the book is the discovery of a new recording containing information about the moments before the murder and the moments that followed, supporting Turkey's accusation that the crime was premeditated and carried out in cold blood.</p> <p>The book also discloses new names of two people who participated in the 15-man so-called Saudi hit squad that killed Khashoggi and dismembered his body.</p> <p>Saeed Mu'ayyad al-Qarni and Muflis Shaya al-Musleh had posed as security guards at the consulate but are in fact agents of Saudi intelligence who carry diplomatic passports, the book states.</p> <p>A third person, Ahmed Abdullah al-Muzaini, was identified in the book as the head of the Istanbul unit of the Saudi intelligence service.</p> <p>Al-Qarni and al-Musleh did not participate in the act of murder, the book said, but were part of the team that arrived a day earlier and carried out explorations in different parts of Istanbul for the purpose of getting rid of the body.</p> <p>Although <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Saudi Arabia</a></span> reported that all members of the hit squad were arrested after they returned to the country, the book cites an unnamed source as saying that Salah al-Tubaigy, the forensic doctor accused of dismembering Khashoggi's body, escaped any action.</p> <p>Instead, the book says, Saudi authorities asked him to disappear from the limelight, and Tubaigy is now living in a villa in Jeddah with his family.</p> <p>The book also says that the head of the hit squad, <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/saudi-prince-aide-consulate-khashoggi-vanished-181018190237727.html">Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb</a></span>, told Khashoggi when he entered the consulate that he would not be harmed if he cooperated with them.</p> <p>He asked Khashoggi to send a message to his son Salah's phone in Riyadh, informing him that he was safe in Istanbul and not to worry if he could not be contacted for a while. Khashoggi refused to do so, and in the recording, cited in the book, can be heard saying: "Will you kill me? Will you suffocate me?"</p> <p>According to the book, Khashoggi maintained his composure when he realised that he would not get out of the consulate alive, after he heard Mutreb ordering five members of the hit squad to attack him by suffocating him with a nylon bag. The recordings indicate that Khashoggi's last sentence was: "Do not cover my mouth. I have asthma, you will suffocate me."</p> <p>Khashoggi resisted his killers for five minutes, according to the book.</p> <p>Afterwards, Khashoggi's body was cut up by Tubaigy using a forensic saw. The book purports that the members of the hit squad, who remained present at the scene, were disturbed and nauseated by the dismemberment.</p> <p>Tubaigy, however, is heard saying in a recording from before the murder "I've never worked on a warm body so far but I can easily handle him [Khashoggi]", according to the book.</p> <p>"Normally, when I'm cutting cadavers, I would put my headphones on and listen to music. I'd also drink my coffee at the same time," Tubaigy continued.</p> <p>The book also states that there is no evidence of how the Saudis got rid of Khashoggi's body, including allegations that the body was disposed of by dissolving it in acid.</p> <p>Furthermore, the book dispels a widely reported claim that after the murder, Mutreb called a superior and told him to "<span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/khashoggi-killing-boss-deed-nyt-181113033718617.html">tell your boss ... the deed is done</a></span>", with reports suggesting the "boss" was MBS.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/khashoggi-murder-book-reveals-details-killing-181230172533470.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/khashoggi-murder-book-reveals-details-killing-181230172533470.html</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.news24.com/World/News/revealed-the-dark-secrets-of-khashoggis-killing-20181230">https://www.news24.com/World/News/revealed-the-dark-secrets-of-khashoggis-killing-20181230</a></span></p> <p><span>and film </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxPEQk3nt-k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxPEQk3nt-k</a></span></p> <p><span>and more details in this longer article:</span></p> <p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p> <p><strong>Khashoggi murder one step closer to resolution with striking new findings</strong></p> <p>The incident takes place at the office of the kingdom's Istanbul Consul General Mohammad al-Otaibi, and contrary to media claims he did not say anything like "don't do this in my room".. Another claim that was all over the media but is actually false is Mutreb's call to someone from the consulate saying "tell the boss the deed is done." According to the book, there is no evidence on that matter. </p> <p>The claim of a local collaborator first mentioned by the Saudis is another one debunked in the book, which states that it was an attempt of the kingdom to "manipulate" the case. Riyadh had previously mentioned the existence of a local collaborator in the case. Yet, when Turkey asked Riyadh to identify them, that same claim by a local collaborator was denied by Saudi Prosecutor Saud Al-Mojeb during his visit to Istanbul on Oct.30.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the book also enlightens readers on questions about the recordings, since there were many claims in the media regarding the issue, implying that they were unlawfully achieved and Turkey was deliberately listening to the building. In reality, the recordings were automatically saved, meaning that Turkey did not deliberately listen to the consulate and save the records.</p> <p>There are also the recordings of the phone traffic between Istanbul and Riyadh, starting from Sept.28, the day that Khashoggi first entered the consulate to demand papers regarding his marriage. The records show that the murder started to be planned on that day.</p> <p>The process of dismembering Khashoggi's body after his killing lasts for half an hour, according to the recordings and the operation was done with an autopsy saw. During the process, the book states that the personnel present in the scene feel bad and nauseated, while Tubaigy shouts at them asking "Why are you standing like that?" According to the book, there is also no evidence on how the Saudis got rid of Khashoggi's body, including any findings on dissolving the body through acid.</p> <p>Following the incident, the consulate was cleared from the residuals of the crime in three stages. Firstly, the murderers themselves roughly cleaned the consulate. Then, the consulate personnel did some thorough cleaning in the afternoon the same day. Lastly, the 'real' and most detailed cleaning takes place after nine days passed from the murder with the arrival of two experts on the issue: a chemist, Halid Yahya el-Zehrani and a toxicologist, Ahmet Abdülaziz el-Cenubi. These two people, known in intelligence terms as "wipers," came with an 11-member Saudi group that visited Turkey following the incident with the claim of helping to uncover the murder. This last cleaning lasted for a week, until Turkish intelligence teams examined the consulate on Oct.17.</p> <p>The book also seeks answers for the reasons why Khashoggi was murdered. Khashoggi is known as a dissident figure that was highly critical of MBS, the kingdom's crown prince. However, according to Ömer Abdulaziz, a close friend of Khashoggi and an activist based in Canada who gave an exclusive interview to the writers of the book, the journalist was more than a critique of the Saudi government. He was actually working on a joint project named the "army of the bees" with Abdulaziz.</p> <p>Today, with the revelation of these new details on the matter, the international community has almost all the information about the Khashoggi case. However, one question remains unanswered: Where is Khashoggi's body? – by Seyma Nazli Gürbüz</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2018/12/29/khashoggi-murder-one-step-closer-to-resolution-with-striking-new-findings">https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2018/12/29/khashoggi-murder-one-step-closer-to-resolution-with-striking-new-findings</a></span></p> <p><span>and the Saudis take this book as a proof of innocence for the Crown prince (while, apart from this one detail, the evidence not at all lets him from the hook), but this look s like wishful thinking:</span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>TURKISH REVELATION: No proof of ‘tell the boss, deed is done’ in Khashoggi case</p> <p>“Tell the boss the deed is done.”</p> <p>These words – reported by <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html">The New York Times</a></span> and then the rest of the world, linked the entire Khashoggi affair to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p> <p>International entities froze ties (before resuming contacts), sweeping statements were made, and the US Congress at least briefly considered punitive measures against Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>A new book has now revealed, there is no evidence on that matter, which was dealt with as a smoking gun in the case. The newly released book – Diplomatic Atrocity: The Dark Secrets of the Khashoggi Murder is written by Ferhat Ünlü, Abdurrahman Şimşek and Nazif Karaman, from Turkey’s Sabah newspaper.</p> <p>‘Less mysterious’</p> <p>As per the details revealed in the book, one of the darkest cases in recent history, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, is becoming “less mysterious thanks to new findings” that reveal the identities of two more members of the hit squad and more voice recordings.</p> <p>Some of the most striking new details are the revelation of new audio recordings that give information about both before and after the murder.</p> <p>The book analyzes the 7.5-minute-long voice recording of the last moments of Khashoggi that Ankara claimed it shared with several countries and intelligence agencies. However, there is no official confirmation on that and even states like France and leader like US president have denied.</p> <p>It denies the claim that was all over the media but is actually false. According to the book, there is no evidence of the claim related to “Mutreb’s call to someone from the consulate saying “tell the boss the deed is done.”</p> <p>The book says “ Another claim that was all over the media but is actually false is Mutreb's call to someone from the consulate saying "tell the boss the deed is done." According to the book, there is no evidence on that matter. The New York Times reported in November that Mutreb called a superior and told him to "tell your boss," with media reports suggesting it was MBS, to confirm that the "mission was carried out" and "the deed is done."”</p> <p>Other major claims</p> <p>The Dark Secrets of the Khashoggi Murder sets the record straight on several other claims that haven’t been substantiated.</p> <p><span><a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2018/12/30/TURKISH-REVELATION-No-evidence-of-tell-the-boss-deed-is-done-in-Khashoggi-case.html">https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2018/12/30/TURKISH-REVELATION-No-evidence-of-tell-the-boss-deed-is-done-in-Khashoggi-case.html</a></span></p> <p><span>Remark: As told by Saudi Al-Arabiya.</span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Newly released VIDEO is said to show Saudi hit team carrying Khashoggi’s body parts in suitcases</p> <p>As the death of Jamal Khashoggi continues to cause international outrage, new footage has emerged purporting to show the journalist’s killers carrying body parts in suitcases into the house of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul.</p> <p>The video, which was initially <span><a href="https://www.ahaber.com.tr/webtv/gundem/kasikcinin-cesedi-boyle-tasindi-ilk-kez-a-haberde">leaked </a></span>to Turkish news channel A Haber, was made public on Sunday evening.

The complete truth about his fate remains elusive in large measure because of a determined Saudi effort to obscure events — an effort that included relaying false information to executives at The Post in the days after Khashoggi’s death.</p> <p>This account of his final 18 months, which reveals new details about Khashoggi’s interactions with Saudi officials, his activities over the last year of his life as an exile and his killing, is based on interviews with dozens of associates, friends and officials from countries including Saudi Arabia and the United States as well as Turkey, where Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.</p> <p>Underestimating the Saudis</p> <p>Khashoggi was an advocate for reform in his country, but he neither saw himself as a dissident nor believed in bringing radical change to a nation that has operated for the past eight decades as an absolute monarchy.</p> <p>He relished his newfound freedoms in the United States and the attention his writing got from a Western audience, but he often resisted appeals from associates to be more forceful in his criticism of the kingdom. He was by many accounts depressed by the separation from his country and the strain that his departure and work placed on his family.</p> <p>Even in exile, Khashoggi remained loyal to Saudi Arabia and reluctant to sever ties to the royal court.</p> <p>But in the conspiracy-driven climate of Middle East politics, Khashoggi came under mounting suspicion because of his writing as well as associations he cultivated over many years with perceived enemies of Riyadh.</p> <p>Among Khashoggi’s friends in the United States were individuals with real or imagined affiliations with the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood, and an Islamic advocacy organization, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, regarded warily for its support of the public uprisings of the Arab Spring. Khashoggi cultivated ties with senior officials in the Turkish government, also viewed with deep distrust by the rulers in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Perhaps most problematic for Khashoggi were his connections to an organization funded by Saudi Arabia’s regional nemesis, Qatar. Text messages between Khashoggi and an executive at Qatar Foundation International show that the executive, Maggie Mitchell Salem, at times shaped the columns he submitted to The Washington Post, proposing topics, drafting material and prodding him to take a harder line against the Saudi government. Khashoggi also appears to have relied on a researcher and translator affiliated with the organization, which promotes Arabic-language education in the United States.</p> <p>A former U.S. diplomat who had known Khashoggi since 2002, Salem said that any assistance she provided Khashoggi was from a friend who sought to help him succeed in the United States. She noted that Khashoggi’s English abilities were limited and said that the foundation did not pay Khashoggi nor seek to influence him on behalf of Qatar.</p> <p>To friends and family members, Khashoggi’s connections were indicative of his intellectual curiosity and disregard for rigid national, religious and ideological boundaries. He traveled constantly, attended dozens of conferences each year and developed long-standing friendships with people whose opinions were at odds with his own – by Souad Mekhenned and Greg Miller</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jamal-khashoggis-final-months-an-exile-in-the-long-shadow-of-saudi-arabia/2018/12/21/d6fc68c2-0476-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jamal-khashoggis-final-months-an-exile-in-the-long-shadow-of-saudi-arabia/2018/12/21/d6fc68c2-0476-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html</a></span></p> <p><span>and this “Qatar connection” is used by US right-wing and Saudi propaganda for a smear campaign against Khashoggi and the Washington Post:</span></p> <p>Washington Post reveals how Qatar Foundation shaped their pieces by Khashoggi</p> <p><span><a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2018/12/23/Washington-Post-reveals-how-Qatar-Foundation-shaped-their-pieces-by-Khashoggi.html">https://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2018/12/23/Washington-Post-reveals-how-Qatar-Foundation-shaped-their-pieces-by-Khashoggi.html</a></span></p> <p>Jamal Khashoggi and The Washington Post’s op-eds</p> <p><span><a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/news/middle-east/2018/12/24/Jamal-Khashoggi-and-the-Washington-Post-s-op-eds.html">https://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/news/middle-east/2018/12/24/Jamal-Khashoggi-and-the-Washington-Post-s-op-eds.html</a></span></p> <p>Khashoggi columns: Washington Post Mideast editor calls it ‘journalistic no-no’</p> <p><span><a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2018/12/24/Who-wrote-Khashoggi-s-last-Washington-Post-article-.html">https://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2018/12/24/Who-wrote-Khashoggi-s-last-Washington-Post-article-.html</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2018/12/28/US-security-body-Khashoggi-Qatari-Turkish-agent-Washington-Post-must-respond.html">https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2018/12/28/US-security-body-Khashoggi-Qatari-Turkish-agent-Washington-Post-must-respond.html</a></span></p> <p><span>is relying on a rather dubious source:</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/jim-hanson">https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/jim-hanson</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/think-tank-led-by-man-who-warned-high-schoolers-clock-was-half-a-bomb-claims-its-advising-white-house-on-qatar-crisis_us_5980e768e4b02b36343e9920">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/think-tank-led-by-man-who-warned-high-schoolers-clock-was-half-a-bomb-claims-its-advising-white-house-on-qatar-crisis_us_5980e768e4b02b36343e9920</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp9 USA</span></h2> <p><span>Siehe / Look at cp1</span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>Chris Henzel confirmed as new US Ambassador for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a>.

For many years, our political, military, and press leadership have intoned the “our friends” mantra. Why? Exactly who benefits from this so-called friendship?</p> <p>Ben Freeman at the Center for International Policy’s Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/3ba8a1_e129a4e0969846d78c9ade6f9ffbb9a0.pdf">has identified</a> many of the American firms that receive <a href="https://efile.fara.gov/docs/5483-Supplemental-Statement-20181102-28.pdf">vast sums of money</a> from the Saudis. This money is laundered through these firms and <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/meet-the-senators-who-took-saudi-money/">into the campaign coffers</a> of our political leaders.</p> <p>It is difficult to imagine how a country that has spent <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/tsunami-of-money-from-saudi-arabia-funding-24000-pakistan-madrassas/articleshow/50781972.cms">billions of dollars both around the world</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/19/911-report-details-saudi-arabia-funding-of-muslim-/">in America</a> supporting a virulently anti-American jihadist ideology can be considered a friend. Adherents of this ideology, Saudis, comprised the leadership, the funders, the operatives, and 15 of the 19 hijackers who attacked us on September 11, 2001, killing 3,000 Americans. Yet Riyadh <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/does-saudi-funded-muslim-radicalization-threaten-india-1.6008341">has not</a> stopped funding madrassas overseas that teach extremism (despite a recent <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/saudi-arabia-terrorism-funding-214241">pledge</a> to do just that), enabling these schools to breed and train new terrorists for the last five decades. America’s leadership has turned a blind eye in order to continue to protect their money flow.</p> <p>Our national leaders also tell us that selling weapons to the Kingdom gives us the benefit of jobs in our country. This is somewhat deceptive. To paraphrase TAC columnist Doug Bandow: we do have people working to make the weapons, but we do not fully benefit from the export of arms because we do not benefit from them here. Instead, the products are sent overseas, often at our expense.</p> <p>The Saudis are good friends to those who benefit from their lobbying largesse and military contracts. But they’re not so good for the rest of us who have to pay the human, social, and financial costs, and suffer under a corrupted political process – by <em>George D.

To develop it, my colleagues and I at Brown University’s <span><a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/">Costs of War Project</a></span> at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, along with <em>Smithsonian</em> magazine, combed through U.S. and foreign government sources, published and unpublished reports, military websites and geographical databases; we contacted foreign embassies in the U.S. and the military’s United States Africa Command; and we conducted interviews with journalists, academics and others. We found that, contrary to what most Americans believe, the war on terror is not winding down—it has spread to more than 40 percent of the world’s countries. The war isn’t being waged by the military alone, which has spent $1.9 trillion fighting terrorism since 2001. The State Department has spent $127 billion in the last 17 years to train police, military and border patrol agents in many countries and to develop antiterrorism education programs, among other activities.</p> <p>Because we have been conservative in our selections, U.S. efforts to combat terrorism abroad are likely more extensive than this map shows.

The famine sweeping the country largely as a result of the crushing embargo against the nation may be the worst on the planet in more than a century, according to the United Nations. More than 1.8 million children are the brink of starvation, with at least 130 dying each day.</p> <p>Despite the rising death toll, Yemen remains a place few Americans have heard of or could place on map. Yet it is where Barack Obama ordered the assassination by drone of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, and two weeks later called up another hit that killed his 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman, also an American citizen. Neither were afforded any kind of due process by the peace prize president.</p> <p>Yemen is also where Donald Trump committed his first war crime, authorizing a commando raid eight days after his inauguration on a village that killed 15 civilians, including, al-Awlaki’s 8-year-old daughter, Nora. Why is the US killing children in Yemen? Who authorized it? What is the goal? When will it end? No one is saying. Few in congress or the press even bother to ask.</p> <p>It’s not a secret war, the way Afghanistan was under Jimmy Carter. It’s something worse: a war no one cares enough about to mention, assess or debate. Yemen is the place where no one hears you scream, even as you shout in horror at the sight of the dismembered bodies of the 10-year-olds who were once your students.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/01/04/yemen-where-no-one-hears-you-scream/">https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/01/04/yemen-where-no-one-hears-you-scream/</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp10 Großbritannien / Great Britain</span></h2> <p><span>(* B K P)</span></p> <p>2018 was another shameful year for the UK’s foreign policy</p> <p>The UK continued to support a bombing campaign which has starved children to death</p> <p><span>As Mwatana for Human Rights, a Yemeni-based human rights organisation, has said “the de facto immunity that the international community has given Saudi Arabia through its silence prevents real justice for violations by all sides.”</span></p> <p><span>The chances of complicit governments, like that of the UK, changing policy of their own accord are minimal.

Despite the circumstances, this meeting proved a success, representing the first time in three years that the Yemeni private sector organized an event bringing together federations, chambers, sector associations, business diaspora organizations, as well as national business support institutions in the service of Yemen’s future. <br /> While many representatives were physically present at the meeting in Sana’a, other representatives connected via video conference from the Yemeni cities of Hodeida, Aden, and Mukalla, as well as internationally from Amman, Dubai, and Istanbul. The meeting was organized by the Small and Micro Enterprise Promotion Service agency (SMEPS), with funding from the World Bank Bringing Back Business (BBB) Project.<br /> Seeking to play a role in improving the dire situation of the country, the gathering laid the groundwork for practical and thought leadership on the role of the private sector in future Yemen recovery and reconstruction efforts. More specifically, the workshop resulted in participants identifying two key pillars aimed towards increasing the participation of the sector in future humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in partnership with the government and donor agencies:</p> <p><span><a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/arabvoices/yemen-s-private-sector-teaming-support-humanitarian-and-recovery-efforts">http://blogs.worldbank.org/arabvoices/yemen-s-private-sector-teaming-support-humanitarian-and-recovery-efforts</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp14 Terrorismus / Terrorism</span></h2> <p><span>(* A T)</span></p> <p>US- Luftangriff gegen mutmaßlichen Al-Kaida-Terroristen</p> <p>Das US-Militär hat einen Luftangriff gegen einen mutmaßlichen Al-Kaida-Terroristen im Jemen ausgeführt, den die USA für den Drahtzieher eines Anschlags auf US-Soldaten vor mehr als 18 Jahren halten.
