Official reports are lagging behind actual infections, just as they have in many other places.</p><p>And as in the rest of the world, millions of people in Yemen are deeply frightened at the prospect of an unknown disease ravaging their country.</p><p>This is the backdrop against which I will update you today on the five overall priorities for the wider humanitarian response: 1) protection of civilians; 2) humanitarian access and delivery; 3) funding; 4) the economy and 5) progress towards peace.</p><p>Let’s start with protection of civilians.</p><p>We welcome the Coalition’s decision to extend its unilateral ceasefire through the holy month of Ramadan. Like the Special Envoy, we hope this will soon translate into a mutual agreement to end all fighting on the ground.</p><p>Recent clashes in Hudaydah, Marib, as Martin mentioned, Al Jawf, Al Bayda, Abyan, Socotra and elsewhere show we are not there yet. Civilian casualties rose again in April, with 177 civilians killed or injured across the country.</p><p>In the first quarter of 2020, six attacks on health facilities were reported – a threefold increase from the previous quarter. At least one such attack was reported in April, despite the pandemic.</p><p>International humanitarian law requires all parties to take constant care to spare civilians and civilian objects throughout military operations. COVID-19 makes it all the more critical to respect and protect medical facilities in line with international law.</p><p>For refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants, stigma is already a grave concern. Reports are growing of refugees and migrants forcibly deported or detained due to COVID-19 fears.</p><p>Incitement against these people – many of whom already endured horrific trauma on their journey to Yemen – is rising.</p><p>Mr. President, the second issue is humanitarian access, which is also required by international humanitarian law. We are working with all stakeholders to take appropriate precautions against COVID-19 while maintaining life-saving assistance.</p><p>But there are several causes for concern. Regular staff rotations are impossible, as aid workers lack predictable access to flights into or out of the country. Nor do we know whether medical evacuations, if required, would be quickly approved. These issues are essential to fulfilling our duty of care to staff.</p><p>We have also noted a disturbing increase, mainly in the north, of harassment and incitement against the United Nations. This needlessly makes our work more dangerous and sometimes forces partners to pause activities at the time when they are needed the most.</p><p>We are asking the Government of Yemen and Ansar Allah authorities to work with us on these points as a matter of urgency, including renewed commitments to aid workers’ safety and security.</p><p>Government processes are too cumbersome and at times interfere with independence of aid.</p><p>Dozens of NGO projects have gone months waiting for approvals in the south, effectively blocking $100 million in donor funding. Visa delays for international staff also remain a concern.</p><p>In the north, access challenges are even more severe. As we noted last month, the authorities have recently made several important improvements, and we appreciate this progress.</p><p>But more is still needed. The most urgent priority is to approve 93 pending NGO projects, many of which have been waiting for months and together represent $180 million in donor investments. We also need more effective procedures for future projects and an end to arbitrary movement delays, detentions, harassment and interference in aid operations.</p><p>Over the last several days, we have had the opportunity to remind senior Ansar Allah officials of all the steps required to put in place the same minimum humanitarian conditions expected everywhere else in the world. We will continue to work with them to achieve the quick results we need to create a more enabling environment for humanitarian action.</p><p>But Mr. President, we desperately need money to pay for these programmes. This brings me to my third point: funding for the aid operation.</p><p>The World Health Organization recently wrote to the Government of Yemen and Ansar Allah authorities in Sana’a to inform them that WHO must progressively reduce their activities due to lack of funding. The COVID-19 Rapid Response Teams that I just mentioned will shut down next month. Therapeutic feeding centres, which treat the most severely malnourished children, will close by August.</p><p>Amidst a pandemic, this is shocking.</p><p>We are urgently appealing to donors to release funds now to sustain principled aid operations.</p><p>Aid agencies estimate they will need up to $2 billion to cover essential activities from June through December.<br />These requirements reflect a tightly prioritized response strategy that will be published later this month.</p><p>Mr. President, the fourth issue is the economy.</p><p>Yemen imports almost everything. For the last several months, commercial food imports through Hudaydah and Saleef have been falling. In April, they totalled just 195,000 metric tons – one of the lowest figures to date. Fuel imports rose considerably in the same period, likely due to lower oil prices.</p><p>Imports must be paid for in hard currency. A weak Yemeni rial – about 600 rial to the US dollar in the north and 690 in the south – means fewer people can afford the basic goods they need to survive. The current exchange rate is three times higher than before the crisis and is severely limiting the Government’s ability to finance imports or pay for public services.</p><p>COVID-19 is poised to make these dynamics even worse. Remittances from abroad – the largest source of foreign exchange in Yemen – are falling, though it is difficult to quantify by how much. Yemenis who still have jobs at home often depend on day labour. These workers need daily wages to feed their families, and many will be ill equipped to restrict movements or comply with similar COVID regulations.</p><p>We need bold action to stabilize the economy and soften the blow of measures that may be necessary to protect public health. </p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/assistant-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-deputy-emergency-relief-4">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/assistant-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-deputy-emergency-relief-4</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Collect your stuff and go… You are free!</strong></p><p>After 4 years of detention, deprivation, and torture in “Al-Saleh City” detention center</p><p>Collect your stuff and go… You are free!</p><p>These are the full-of-freedom words said by the confident detention guard and chief investigator to the civil detainee, Abdel-Hamid Muhammad Jaafar Al-Janadi (50 years old), at Al-Saleh City prison, after a 4-year period of deprivation and physical and psychological torture against him.</p><p>Abdel-Hamid was detained from his own home on the evening of August 24, 2016, after 10 military pickup cars full of Ansar Allah (Houthi) group soldiers “Houthis” had surrounded his house in Al-Janad village, Taiziyah district in Taiz Governorate, and shot him in the left thigh, in full view of his family and children. He was forcibly taken to Al-Saleh City, located in Mafraq Mawiyah, north of Taiz, which used by Ansar Allah group to detain dozens of people.</p><p>On December 19, 2019, Abdel-Hamid was released, based on a prisoner exchange deal that took place between “Ansar Allah” group on one hand and government forces on the other hand, despite he denied any involvement in any war or armed actions.</p><p>Describing his years of detention to Mwatana for Human Rights, Abdel-Hamid says, “In the beginning, I was held alone in a narrow and dark room so-called (Aden Chamber) as it is too hot and carbon-coated. It is full of insects and dirtiness.”</p><p>Under this harsh circumstance, his detention lasted for six months, without receiving any sympathy except from the wound in his leg, which began to rot. He says, “You can imagine the length of nights, feelings of suffocation, helplessness and waiting for death.”</p><p>According to Abdel-Hamid, there was no latrine in the room, so he resorted to the trick of minimizing his food and drink to one loaf and yoghurt twice a day so that he would not defecate in the same place where he slept.</p><p>Abdel-Hamid said that he was psychologically and physically tortured periodically. He was denied of having medications and sedatives, as he confronted that with screaming in pain in the face of his jailers, seeking help to get a sedative that might relieve his pain, but without any response from them.</p><p>On the investigation, Abdel-Hamid says that he was interrogated from the night of his arrival at the Al-Saleh Detention center. He was charged with several charges, most notably the identification of location coordinates for the Coalition’s Air-forces, communication with the leaders of Islah Party, and writing against Ansar Allah group on the social media. He also says that the interrogation sessions continued for long hours, during which he was physically tortured with sticks and electricity shocks until he lost consciousness. His jailers used his wounds and the metal nails attached to his leg to torture him with electricity.</p><p><span><a href="https://mwatana.org/en/collect-your-stuff-and-go/">https://mwatana.org/en/collect-your-stuff-and-go/</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Coronavirus und Seuchen / Most important: Coronavirus and epidemics</span></h2><p>(* A H)</p><p><span>Yemen reports 21 new coronavirus cases including three deaths</span></p><p>Yemen’s Saudi-backed government reported on Friday 21 new coronavirus cases, including three deaths, the coronavirus committee said on Twitter.</p><p>The committee added that 13 of the new cases were in Aden, and eight in Hadramout, including the three deaths.</p><p>The Aden-based government committee said the tally for confirmed coronavirus cases in areas under its control now stands at 106, including 15 deaths.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-yemen/yemen-reports-21-new-coronavirus-cases-including-three-deaths-idUSKBN22R2ED">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-yemen/yemen-reports-21-new-coronavirus-cases-including-three-deaths-idUSKBN22R2ED</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Weakened by war and floods, Yemen fights twin health threat</strong></p><p>Yet, as customers do their shopping in Mukalla, there is no sign of the global coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Nobody keeps their distance and there isn’t a mask in sight. Food sellers handle raw meat, swat at flies and exchange cash without wearing gloves.</p><p>Crippled by civil war, severe food shortages and now a wave of diseases linked to recent heavy rains, Yemen’s shattered healthcare system is being pushed to the brink of collapse by these pressures and the novel coronavirus, health experts warn.</p><p>Yemen has announced 72 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 13 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.</p><p>But health experts believe the real number of cases is far higher, given the lack of tracking and testing capabilities in the poorest country in the Arabian Peninsula.</p><p>Sources told Reuters this week that there has been apparent under-counting in both the north and south of the country.</p><p>“This is only the tip of the iceberg,” said Abdulla Bin Ghouth, professor of community medicine and epidemiology at Hadhramout University’s College of Medicine.</p><p>Finding out the true numbers affected requires medical know-how and resources beyond the reach of Yemen’s health system, which depends heavily on international organisations for funding, equipment and staff, he said.</p><p>“The capacity of the Yemeni health system ... to carry out active surveillance is so weak,” he said, predicting the country would soon see a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases.</p><p>“There has been a surge in the number of fever deaths since the rains,” Farooq Q. Naji, director of the epidemics unit at the government-run al-Jumhuriyah hospital in Aden, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p><p>In the past month alone, his hospital has received hundreds of patients with dengue and viral fevers, resulting in dozens of deaths. Before the rains came, he was seeing about three cases a day, he said.</p><p>“On the streets, there are still rain swamps mixed with garbage, making them breeding grounds for mosquitoes,” he added.</p><p>Doctors say the spike in dengue cases is disrupting efforts aimed at fighting the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p><p>“We have been forced to send home some patients who show signs of recovery as we are running out of beds,” said Abha Abdullah Baowaidan, director of Mukalla Maternity and Childhood Hospital.</p><p>It has received more than 6,000 cases of fever in its emergency room in the past two months, the doctor noted.</p><p>The country’s hospitals are also suffering from a shortage of testing kits and other equipment, making it difficult - if not impossible - to know whether a patient is infected with COVID-19 or something else, say health professionals.</p><p>Naji at al-Jumhuriyah hospital recalled a case in April when a patient came in with severe respiratory symptoms.</p><p>The rapid response team that had been dispatched to test the patient for the new coronavirus was out of swabs and had to travel to another province to find some.</p><p>By the time they returned three hours later, the patient had died and at least two hospital workers had been infected with the virus, Naji said.</p><p>As war, intense rains and widespread disease have increased the burden on Yemen’s critically under-funded health system, the coronavirus pandemic now threatens to push it over the edge.</p><p>“The war and climate change have created a humanitarian crisis,” said Bin Ghouth, the epidemiologist – by Saeed Al-Batati</p><p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-yemen-feature-trfn/weakened-by-war-and-floods-yemen-fights-twin-health-threat-idUSKBN22Q1BD?rpc=401&amp;">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-yemen-feature-trfn/weakened-by-war-and-floods-yemen-fights-twin-health-threat-idUSKBN22Q1BD?rpc=401&amp;</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>COVID-19 may be 'catastrophic' for Yemen: WHO official</strong></p><p>Health system in Yemen unable to fully prepare for pandemic after 5 years of war, says WHO Yemen representative</p><p>If allowed to spread within the war-torn country, the novel coronavirus threatens to become a "catastrophic" disaster in Yemen, according to an official with the World Health Organization (WHO).</p><p>"The health system here is already fragile. Should the virus become fully transmissible in Yemen, it will be catastrophic in the country," Altaf Musani, the WHO Representative and mission chief in Yemen, told Anadolu Agency in an exclusive interview on the latest developments about the virus's spread in the Middle Eastern country.</p><p>Noting that though the country's health system was starting efforts to prepare for a response to the pandemic, Musani warned that it would never be fully prepared as it had experienced conflict within its borders for the past five years.</p><p>"This health system will never be fully prepared, because we've had five years of war, and that conflict, that vulnerability, and that fragility has really weakened the health system to deal with routine health matters such as cholera, dengue and malaria."</p><p>Musani said he was "deeply worried" should the country find itself facing coronavirus cases, since the health system would "not be able to manage" the outbreak.</p><p>Musani underlined that the WHO was dealing with both of two different authorities in the country, adding that they were providing capacity to both.</p><p>"We have a situation where we deal with two different authorities, the internationally recognized government and Aden as well as the de facto authorities in Sanaa. We have provided capacity to both these entities to make sure that they can test for the virus, trace for the virus, of course isolate and treat," he said.</p><p>Musani said that testing was available in the city of of Sana'a under the Houthis' control, while in the south, testing was carried out in Aden, Al-Mukalla and Taiz. He said WHO was making efforts to support the country's health authorities to launch an additional lab in the southern city of Seiyun, and "hoping to have testing capability" in the coastal province of Al-Hudaydah.</p><p>"So that would make six central public health laboratories nationwide that would be capacitated to have the necessary means to run the PCR [Polymerase Chain Reaction] samples," he said, adding that those six would be further expanded based on the availability of tests.</p><p>Testing for COVID-19 requires rapid response teams, Musani said, noting that such teams had been deployed at "almost every district" of Yemen due to a cholera outbreak two years ago.</p><p>"These rapid response teams have been further trained and will continue to scale up. They can do the screening at the points of entry, they can do investigation of rumors, and then, the third, and the most important thing they do is they take samples of suspect cases."</p><p>He explained that after a sample, or swab, is taken from the interior of a patient's nose or the back of their throat, it is transported to one of the six labs across the country. Test results are reported to the country's Ministry of Public Health, which then reports the figures to WHO as members states are legally required to report any public health emergency of international concern to the organization.</p><p>WHO, in turn, provides the "public health advice," as well as some material operational support, he said.</p><p>"We help them with PPE [personal protective equipment], we help them with tests, we help them with swabs, we help them with PCR machines. And then of course, we provide some financial support based on what donors have provided us from COVID-19 response."</p><p>"Based on models that have been developed worldwide and for Yemen, the number of tests that would be required are millions, we don't have those tests. The amount of PPE [personal protective equipment] that would be required is millions. We don't have that kind of PPE, and the type and number of hospitals that may have admissions are in the hundreds of thousands," he explained.</p><p>Musani emphasized that so far 10% of hospitals worldwide have been dedicated to combating the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>"We are deeply worried that the amount of PPE, testing kits, labs, healthcare workforce are grossly insufficient in Yemen to manage the outbreak at peak."</p><p><span><a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/health/covid-19-may-be-catastrophic-for-yemen-who-official/1839372">https://www.aa.com.tr/en/health/covid-19-may-be-catastrophic-for-yemen-who-official/1839372</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Exclusive: As COVID-19 cases in Yemen surge, some sources see undercounting</strong></p><p>Yemen has more suspected coronavirus cases and deaths than the authorities have so far reported, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, as the United Nations warned the virus is spreading in the war-ravaged country.</p><p>The Saudi-backed government based in the south and the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement headquartered in the north have so far publicly announced a total of 67 cases with 11 deaths. Only two of those infections and one of the deaths was reported by the Houthi authorities, both in the capital Sanaa.</p><p>The sources said there was apparent undercounting in both the north and south of the country.</p><p>The four sources, who have access to information from hospitals but who declined to be named, said Houthi health authorities had not shared additional test results with the World Health Organization (WHO) for at least 50 further patients with COVID-19 symptoms they were aware of at Kuwait hospital in Sanaa. Two of the sources said 20 other patients they had seen with similar symptoms died in that hospital.</p><p>The two other sources said they were aware of at least 30 suspected coronavirus cases admitted to another Sanaa facility, Sheikh Zayed hospital, and said test results for those cases had also not been shared.</p><p>Reuters did not see medical records from the hospitals and could not independently confirm the numbers provided by the sources. The hospitals could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>“Houthi authorities do not share the results of the tests with doctors and with the WHO when the results are positive,” one of the sources told Reuters.</p><p>Asked by Reuters whether it was concerned about a coronavirus outbreak going unreported in Houthi-held areas, the WHO said its role was to “actively advise, influence and inform” discussions on case declaration and reporting, which it said it had been doing for weeks.</p><p>It said it saw Yemen as “one country, one people” and cautioned against speculation related to “the number of probable cases not being reported”.</p><p>“Given the testing capacity in country, which is very limited, tests are being done on persons who meet the criteria or case definition and exposure history. We would not, and frankly no country would, be able to test everyone who was sick or experiencing symptoms,” it said in a statement.</p><p>It said it was “operating under the assumption that full blown transmission is now occurring” across Yemen and that it was ramping up “community engagement and awareness activities.”</p><p>DEATHS IN ADEN</p><p>The internationally-recognised government based in the southern port of Aden has accused the Houthis of covering up an outbreak in Sanaa, a charge the group denies. In a tweet on May 7, Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani said there appeared to be a “serious epidemiological coronavirus situation” in Houthi-controlled areas and urged the authorities not to “conceal facts”.</p><p>However, the two sources said authorities in areas under the Saudi-backed government’s control have also not fully disclosed the extent of the pandemic. At least 13 confirmed COVID-19 patients have died at Al Amal hospital in Aden, they said. The hospital could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>“In Aden, we also have dozens of people dying at home but nobody tested them to know why they died.

influence of the former Soviet Union. Led by Yemeni General Aidarous al Zubaidi, former governor of Aden, the UAE has been backing it since 2017. The clash between STC and internationally-recognised Hadi government started when two sides began debating the inclusion of Yemen’s Sunni party (Al Islah) in Hadi’s government. </p><p>According to Gamal Gasim, a Yemen analyst and professor of political science at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, the UAE wants to slice Yemen into two parts: one governed by the STC and the other by Hadi government. </p><p>After achieving the division, Gasim told Al Jazeera, the UAE wants to "destroy the Al Islah party". </p><p>Al Islah is one of the largest political factions in Yemen with links to the Muslim Brotherhood. The Gulf monarchies have always stood against the Muslim Brotherhood for its anti-monarchist and pro-democratic views. Al Islah is currently fighting against the Houthis in the north. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/why-are-saudi-and-the-uae-competing-in-southern-yemen-36281">https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/why-are-saudi-and-the-uae-competing-in-southern-yemen-36281</a></span></p><p><span>(B K P)</span></p><p><span>Der verpfuschte saudische Krieg</span></p><p><span>Trotz der über fünf Jahre andauernden militärischen Intervention im Jemen konnte die Koalition unter der Führung Saudi-Arabiens das Bürgerkriegsland nicht vor dem Zerfall retten. </span></p><p><span><a href="https://de.qantara.de/inhalt/jemenkonflikt-der-verpfuschte-saudische-krieg">https://de.qantara.de/inhalt/jemenkonflikt-der-verpfuschte-saudische-krieg</a></span></p><p><span>Mein Kommentar: Ein Überblicksartikel, der eigentlich nichts bringt.

Juni erhältlich)</em> ist der Versuch, dieser Sprachlosigkeit entgegenzutreten. Bushra al-Maktari hat ihr Land durchreist und die Protokolle von 400 Frauen und Männern gesammelt, deren Leben vom Krieg zerstört wurden – auch wenn sie selbst noch am Leben sind. Die Berichte – 43 davon sind in dem Band abgedruckt – beschönigen nichts. In drastischen Worten wird beschrieben, was eine Kriegsmaschinerie, die im sechsten Kriegsjahr nur noch punktuell die Wahrnehmungsschwelle westlicher Medien zu erreichen vermag, unter der Zivilbevölkerung im Jemen anrichtet (die Organisatoren und Profiteure des Krieges, auch darauf wird hingewiesen, haben ihre Domizile längst ins Ausland verlegt). Es ist der Versuch, in Worte zu fassen, wie Streubomben töten und wie es sich anfühlt, wenn die eigenen Kinder, Geschwister oder Eltern direkt vor einem von Granaten zerrissen, Maschinengewehren zerfetzt oder herabfallenden Trümmern erschlagen oder verschüttet werden.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/literatur/der-nicht-endende-krieg-im-jemen-vergessene-leiden/25823156.html">https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/literatur/der-nicht-endende-krieg-im-jemen-vergessene-leiden/25823156.html</a></span></p><p><span>(B K P)</span></p><p>Will a Coronavirus-Related Cease Fire Pause the Yemeni Civil War?</p><p>The worsening COVID-19 pandemic in both Saudi Arabia and Yemen is driving both countries to want to preserve their military resources. For Saudi Arabia, de-escalating operations in the war-torn country would also allow it to focus on other burning fires at home, including its shaky Vision 2030 economic trajectory and the recent breakdown of OPEC+ cooperation.

Evidence is presented of probable genocidal war crimes by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen and indications that certain Western powers may be culpable. Also, this paper will look at a new cold war between Saudi Arabia and Iran and how the conflict in Yemen is a proxy war.

The year 2015 was very significant. That year the Russian military intervention in Syria began, the conflict in Yemen broke out and was internationalized simultaneously. This state-oriented study has two levels of analysis, namely regional and global. Although the global dimension can be observed and analysed in both selected conflicts, its seems to be much more noticeable and significant in case of the Syrian war especially due to the direct Russian engagement as well as the American response to it. A very limited institutionalization of international relations in the Middle East region seriously undermines opportunities for a peaceful conflict resolution in the region and therefore requires participation and engagement of non-regional actors especially of global powers which can exert either direct or indirect pressure on various regional actors. As far as sources are concerned, the study is based on selected documents, monographs, academic articles, reports, and analyses.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/34445433/THE_ONGOING_MILITARY_CONFLICTS_IN_SYRIA_AND_YEMEN_RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS_THEIR_CONSEQUENCES_AND_SCENARIOS">https://www.academia.edu/34445433/THE_ONGOING_MILITARY_CONFLICTS_IN_SYRIA_AND_YEMEN_RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS_THEIR_CONSEQUENCES_AND_SCENARIOS</a></span></p><p>My comment: Too much of Iran, not enough of the “West”.</p><p>(* B K P)</p><p>(from 2017): Beyond Money and Diplomacy: Regional Policies of Saudi Arabia and UAE after the Arab Spring</p><p>The post-Arab Spring context created a window of opportunity for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to reposition themselves in the region as countries capable of using not only money and diplomacy, but also military means in pursuing their regional policies. Their military interventions in Bahrain in 2011 and Yemen in 2015 uncover different aspects of the militarisation of their foreign policies. The permanence of the militarisation of their policies is, however, challenged by the type of interventionist state unfolding from these muscular policies, their domestic and regional legitimacy and the institutionalisation of this foreign policy pattern.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/33548517/Beyond_Money_and_Diplomacy_Regional_Policies_of_Saudi_Arabia_and_UAE_after_the_Arab_Spring?email_work_card=title">https://www.academia.edu/33548517/Beyond_Money_and_Diplomacy_Regional_Policies_of_Saudi_Arabia_and_UAE_after_the_Arab_Spring?email_work_card=title</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp3 Humanitäre Lage / Humanitarian situation</span></h2><p><span>Siehe / Look at cp1</span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>48,000 Yemeni women could die giving birth as UN starts shutting down maternity services due to funding gap</p><p>The United Nations agency that runs maternity wards and maternal health services across war-torn <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/yemen-civil-war/">Yemen</a></span> says the program is nearly out of money.

"It was bad before corona. We have weekly meetings, and… you can see an aura of hopelessness, given the corona that's knocking on our doors."</p><p>People in Yemen already have very limited access to healthcare, with only about half of the health facilities functioning across the country. Of those, only 20% offer maternal and child health services - many of which are supported by UNFPA. If it is unable to raise more funds by July, it will be forced to close up to 90% of its services in Yemen.</p><p>"They have no health system, and there is no political organization to support them. So how hopeful are we? We only know that the hopes of the population are on us," Owomuhangi said.</p><p><span>UNFPA operates a wide range of sexual and reproductive services in many countries, but in Yemen it focuses primarily on life-saving interventions during childbirth.</span></p><p><span>"It's already the minimum service," Arthur Erken, UNFPA's director of strategic partnerships and communications, told CBS News. "These health facilities that lack staff, that lack supplies, that have been bombed or been severely damaged by the war, are already in a difficult state - these 140 need to stay open. Otherwise the consequences will be directly – the health and death will be directly a result of closing (them). Of course, if you have no money, that's pretty much end-of-story," he said.</span></p><p><span>Even before the coronavirus started spreading across the world, the agency didn't have enough funding to make it to the end of this year.</span></p><p>"Women are pregnant. They were pregnant before the crisis. They're pregnant now. How do you deal with that?" said Erken. He said the crisis can only be addressed by the international community collectively, and he urged nations to step up through the U.N., "to make sure that being pregnant is not a death sentence in the coronavirus crisis."</p><p><span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-news-un-maternity-wards-in-yemen-are-out-of-money/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-news-un-maternity-wards-in-yemen-are-out-of-money/</a></span></p><p>(B H)</p><p><span>Yemen: Education Cluster Monthly Analytical Dashboard (January - March 2020)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-education-cluster-monthly-analytical-dashboard-january-march-2020">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-education-cluster-monthly-analytical-dashboard-january-march-2020</a></span></p><p>Yemen: Education Cluster GAP Analysis (as of March 2020)</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-education-cluster-gap-analysis-march-2020">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-education-cluster-gap-analysis-march-2020</a></span></p><p><span>Yemen: Education Cluster Gap Analysis (January - April 2020)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-education-cluster-gap-analysis-january-april-2020">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-education-cluster-gap-analysis-january-april-2020</a> </span></p><p><span>(A H P)</span></p><p>Al-Sabeen hospital in Capital Sanaa appeals to UN to continue supporting humanitarian field</p><p>The hospital stated in its appeal, Saba got a copy of it, that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA ) stopped providing aid, which would hinder the provision of reproductive health services and obstetric care in the hospital.</p><p>The statement pointed to the delay by the UNICEF in providing cash assistance to the hospital's medical staff, which numbers are more than 350 staff.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.saba.ye/en/news3096837.htm">https://www.saba.ye/en/news3096837.htm</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span><span>Kinderschutz im Jemen / Save the Children</span></p><p>Shaif arbeitet für Save the Children im Jemen.
