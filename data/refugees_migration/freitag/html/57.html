The health centre is staffed by a team of experienced health professionals. Besides the doctors and nurses, the Al Jufainah centre has a midwife, pharmacist, lab technician and nutrition and vaccination assistants on staff.</p><p>IOM also operates two mobile health clinics in the vast Al Jufainah camp reaching those unable to travel to the new centre.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/first-health-centre-opens-yemen-s-largest-displacement-camp">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/first-health-centre-opens-yemen-s-largest-displacement-camp</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>‘The host community is as vulnerable as we are’: insights into the IDP crisis in Hodeida and the humanitarian response</p><p>This article explores the realities of internal displacement in Yemen, the challenges faced by IDPs and the communities hosting them in accessing assistance and the opportunities for a more effective humanitarian response. It calls on the humanitarian sector to develop more robust community engagement mechanisms and a more holistic approach that takes into account local conditions, and the increasing pressure on both those internally displaced and the communities hosting them.</p><p>The humanitarian situation</p><p>Four governorates – Marib, Taiz, Hajjah and Hodeida – were housing around 53% of IDPs in late 2018, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM)’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM)</p><p>The psychological trauma of displacement is being compounded by perceptions of IDPs as a ‘burden’ on host communities. IDPs interviewed for this article described how they limited interactions with people in host communities in order to minimise feelings of distress. </p><p>There are, though, examples of social solidarity in the relationship between displaced people and surrounding families, exemplified for instance in inter-marriage between the two communities. Respondents generally called for psychosocial support from international organisations to reduce tensions between IDPs and host communities and address the trauma associated with displacement.</p><p>Concluding remarks</p><p>Interviews for this article demonstrate the need for more locally owned humanitarian response in Yemen, with engagement with local communities put at the heart of the response. Respondents pointed to the need to deepen the level of engagement of local NGOs and IDPs throughout the process of aid delivery, and not just as implementing partners. A stronger focus on IDPs and host communities could also help ensure that the social fabric in Yemen is maintained, and that local grievances are not amplified – by Ibrahim Jalal, Sherine El Taraboulsi-McCarthy</p><p><span><a href="https://odihpn.org/magazine/yemen-host-community-idp-crisis-hodeida-humanitarian-response/">https://odihpn.org/magazine/yemen-host-community-idp-crisis-hodeida-humanitarian-response/</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>IOM Yemen | Displacement Rapid Displacement Tracking (RDT) - Reporting Period : 01 - 07 Mar 2020</p><p><span>The ongoing conflict in Yemen, since March 2015, has led to the displacement of more than 3.6 million people (according to DTM's 2018 Area Assessment).

They think he is a holy man,” she said, referring to Houthi movement leader. Before raiding her house, Ibetisam said the Houthis harassed her online to stop her activism. “They subjected me to different methods of psychological pressure such as sending death threats through text messages and attacking me on social media,” she said.<br /> After Houthi reprisal attacks, she thought that the Houthis had put her on their radar and would keep abusing her if she continued criticizing them. At the same time, the widowed mother of three had to keep demanding Houthis to pay her husband’s pension in order to survive. “They have not paid the pension for the last three years. We survive on my daughter’s salary.”<br /> She and her children fled Sanaa under the cover of darkness. “We hired a car that drove us to Aden.” Confirming media reports about Houthi mishandling of humanitarian aid, Ibetisam said that Houthis give out aid to loyalists or those families who agreed to send children to take part in fighting.<br /> “Those who do not have combatant relatives have no choice but to beg to survive. People cannot speak out because if they criticize Houthi misbehavior, they will beat or abduct them,” Ibetisam said, adding that people in Sanaa struggle to get basic services such as cooking gas, electricity or water.</p><p>After hearing about her ordeal, officials at the internationally recognized government helped her travel to Cairo and then to Riyadh, where she recounted to Arab News her harsh days under Houthi rule.<br /> After hearing about her disappearance, Houthis began harassing her relatives.</p><p>Despite Houthi repression, several Yemeni women have remained in Sanaa, where they criticize Houthi political and economic policies – by Saeed Al-Batati</p><p><span><a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1639776/middle-east">https://www.arabnews.com/node/1639776/middle-east</a></span></p><p><span>My remark: From a Saudi news site, by a Yemeni author.

Women are abducted by Houthi armed group for many unlawful and illogical reasons such as; peacefully protesting for better living conditions, political opposition and affiliation, and traveling from a city to another. In its statistics, the association used the reports of victims' families and interviewing former female abductees.</p><p>The violations led to a bigger decline in liberties and social peace. At Houthi prisons, many women have been defamed by falsely accusing them of prostitution in order to keep them away from society and prolonging their detention. Women's rights in Yemen, which have been fiercely fought for, have been deteriorating as international community and Security Council is looking forward to increasing the participation of women in peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction, according to Resolution 1325.</p><p>Abductees' Mothers Association is to publish a series of abduction victims' testaments. The series will include testaments of women who are still detained at Houthi prisons, where they have been subjected to physical torture and verbal abuse, and have not been allowed to have any contact with their families. There are many other former abductees who have been arrested while traveling inside Yemen.</p><p>Houthi armed group continues abducting and blackmailing women since the beginning of 2018 until this day, denouncing international human rights agreements and Yemeni values</p><p><span><a href="http://www.ama-ye.org/index.php?no=1231&amp;ln=En">http://www.ama-ye.org/index.php?no=1231&amp;ln=En</a></span></p><p>and</p><p>(B P)</p><p>Khaleda Mohammad Ahmed Al-Aabahi 52 years old</p><p>After 2 days, my mother called from a strange number.

They cite remarks by Yemeni officials and others following the envoy’s meetings in Marib. For example, the governor of Marib, General Sultan Al-Arada said: “We are for real and honourable peace. It would neither do us nor the UN envoy any honour if we supported false peace. There can be no stability or development without peace. But peace under the continued existence of that militia is not peace.”</p><p>Baligh Al-Mikhlafi, spokesman for the Yemeni government negotiating delegation in Stockholm agreed that the Marib visit was a failure. “Most of the agenda of that visit had nothing to do with Griffiths’ mission,”</p><p>Many observers believe that Griffiths wants to repeat the Hodeida scenario: a halt to the anti-Houthi resistance that allows the Houthis to hold on to their territorial advances. Commenting on the UN envoy’s visit to Marib, the former Yemeni diplomat Abdel-Wahab Tawaf said: “The point of that visit was to lay the groundwork for an international resolution that would stop any attempt to regain Al-Jawf and Nahm, just as occurred with Hodeida.” Regardless of whether such a resolution is likely, the parallels between Marib and Hodeida have led pro-government sources to oppose the Marib initiative. They say that after more than a year since it was formed, the UN-sponsored security committee created in the framework of the Stockholm agreement has not only been unable to restrain the Houthis on the Hodeida front, their escalation has increased in tandem with a rise in the Houthis’ demographic engineering. The observers warn against repeating the mistakes of the past in Marib.</p><p><span><a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/50/1203/365115/AlAhram-Weekly/World/Griffiths-stymied-in-Yemen.aspx">http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/50/1203/365115/AlAhram-Weekly/World/Griffiths-stymied-in-Yemen.aspx</a></span></p><p>My comment: This is from Egypt, adopting the Hadi government viewpoint.

Over the weekend pictures were released of King Salman greeting ambassadors, to disprove rumours sparked by the purge that the king had died. Sources at the King Faisal Hospital dedicated to the care of members of the royal family also dispelled those rumours.</p><p>Before his arrest on Friday, Prince Ahmed, the king's younger full brother, was given one last chance, after years of public opposition, to come aboard the MBS project, and he refused, the sources said.</p><p>"There was pressure on Ahmed to give his full support to MBS. He met with the king, and Salman and others in the court used polite words to encourage him to back his son," a second source said.</p><p>"Ahmed made it clear he would not support this project. He did not give his word. Ahmed told the king he himself was not keen to become king but would look to others to come forward."</p><p>Summons from the king</p><p>Meanwhile, more details emerged about the circumstances of Ahmed's arrest.</p><p>According to the sources, Ahmed was not planning a coup before his arrest on Friday morning, as was claimed in one briefing given to Reuters, primarily because the prince had no power to make such a move. </p><p>"Prince Ahmed would have openly objected to his nephew's accession, as a member of the Allegiance Council, if the king dies and the question of accession to the throne comes formally before it," the source said.</p><p>"He would have clearly said no. But there was no attempted coup."</p><p>Trump concerns</p><p>Asked why this purge was launched now, the sources cited external and internal reasons.</p><p>They said MBS was becoming concerned about the possibility that Donald Trump would not secure a second term of office as US president. </p><p>All the presidential candidates remaining in the Democratic race are declared critics of the crown prince and had openly condemned him for allegedly ordering the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in 2018.</p><p>Oil fears</p><p>Internally, MBS's reforms are not going well. </p><p>The two latest hitches to his reform plan are the rapid fall in the price of oil, to below the level at which the state budget needs for its income, and his increasing unpopularity in the Muslim world, months before the annual Hajj is due to start.</p><p>'Delicate generational succession'</p><p>Controversy has also stalked MBS's decision to effectively close the borders of the kingdom to most visitors and all Umrah pilgrims, because of the <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/coronavirus">coronavirus</a></span> epidemic – by David Hearst</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-saudi-crown-prince-plans-become-king-novembers-g20-summit">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-saudi-crown-prince-plans-become-king-novembers-g20-summit</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>In Saudi Arabia, the Virus Crisis Meets Inept Leadership</p><p>Saudi Arabia is facing serious challenges from the coronavirus, testing a leadership that has been impulsive and exclusive. The monarchy has become more remote from even most of the royal family in the last five years. Now the monarchy’s response to the virus has been unprecedented. Attention should be focused particularly on the young man who makes the day-to-day decisions in the Royal Palace.</p><p>So far, the kingdom has reported publicly only a small number of confirmed cases of infection, but its neighborhood has been badly affected—especially Iran. Close neighbors including Bahrain and Kuwait have reported numerous cases.</p><p>The global economic downturn, led by China, has pushed the price of oil down significantly as demand has dropped precipitously. The Saudis are under pressure to cut production to stimulate growth, but that means less revenue for the kingdom. With an expensive war in Yemen that is heating up, <span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/02/26/yemens-war-is-escalating-again/">as I recently wrote</a></span>, the economy is stagnant.</p><p>King Salman, like his predecessors, puts much stock in being the custodian of the Holy Mosques. If the annual pilgrimage is canceled, it will have consequences for the legitimacy of the House of Saud, even if it makes public health sense to shut it down this year.</p><p>The kingdom has been transformed into a nation gripped by fear. The crown prince has arrested and shaken down the cream of Saudi society; tortured women who spoke in favor of driving, because he can’t bear sharing the publicity of ending the women driving ban; and kidnapped and beat up the prime minister of Lebanon, just to name some of his violent actions.</p><p>Among the most disturbing aspects of the prince’s rise to power is that many prominent, self-styled Western experts on the region were entranced with him for years. They bought his slick Vision 2030, thinking it was a real roadmap for change even though it has no political dimension. It’s also unrealistic.</p><p>Many ignored the prince’s signature foreign policy initiative: the war in Yemen. The war is a very much a one-man show ordered by MBS over the better judgement of many other princes, who worried it would become the quagmire it is today, costing the kingdom a fortune.</p><p>One of the best chapters in Hubbard’s book on MBS is about the war in Yemen. It includes exclusive reporting from a rare trip the author made to Sana’a in 2016. Many Yemenis blame America for the war since the planes, the bombs, and the pilots that have destroyed schools and targeted weddings are made in America or trained in America.</p><p>The crown prince’s signature domestic goal is to build a super-modern computerized city along the Saudi coast of the Gulf of Aqaba, near the borders of Egypt, Israel, and Jordan. The NEOM project is central to the crown prince’s plan for the future of the kingdom. But in the Gulf, NEOM is nicknamed by the Saudi-watchers “Never Ever Opening, Man.” It may be a parable for the kingdom’s own future – by Bruce Riedel</p><p><span><a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/saudi-arabia-virus-crisis-meets-inept-leadership">https://www.lawfareblog.com/saudi-arabia-virus-crisis-meets-inept-leadership</a></span></p><p>referring to</p><p>(* B P)</p><p>New Book:</p><p><span>MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman</span>, by Ben Hubbard</p><p><em>MBS </em>is the untold story of how a mysterious young prince emerged from Saudi Arabia’s sprawling royal family to overhaul the economy and society of the richest country in the Middle East—and gather as much power as possible into his own hands. Since his father, King Salman, ascended to the throne in 2015, Mohammed bin Salman has leveraged his influence to restructure the kingdom’s economy, loosen its strict Islamic social codes, and confront its enemies around the region, especially Iran. That vision won him fans at home and on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley, in Hollywood, and at the White House, where President Trump embraced the prince as a key player in his own vision for the Middle East. But over time, the sheen of the visionary young reformer has become tarnished, leaving many struggling to determine whether MBS is in fact a rising dictator whose inexperience and rash decisions are destabilizing the world’s most volatile region.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/MBS-Rise-Power-Mohammed-Salman/dp/1984823825">https://www.amazon.com/MBS-Rise-Power-Mohammed-Salman/dp/1984823825</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>Arrests of Saudi Arabian Princes Reportedly a Warning Against Possible Coup Attempts</p><p><span>The source added that the arrests sent a message to anyone in the royal family feeling disenfranchised: Stop grumbling and toe the line, because if Prince Ahmed can be arrested, any prince can and will be. Prince Ahmed was seen as a person who royals could look to when feeling vexed with the crown prince’s grip on power, the person said.</span></p><p>The arrests came as a surprise, given that Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 60, was widely known to be under close surveillance since he was shunted out of the line of succession by the king’s son in mid-2017, a person close to the royal court said.</p><p>The arrest of Prince Ahmed, 78, was also unexpected since he is the king’s full younger brother and also a senior member of the ruling Al Saud family.</p><p>Prince Ahmed, however, has long held unfavorable views of the crown prince and was one of just a few senior princes to abstain from pledging allegiance to him when the young royal sidelined more senior princes to become first in line to the throne.</p><p>Both princes had served previously in the post of interior minister, overseeing security and surveillance inside the kingdom.</p><p><span>The crown prince has succeeded in a few short years at sweeping aside any competition from royals older and more experienced than him. He has also overhauled the most powerful security bodies to report to him.</span></p><p>The arrest of the two senior princes is most likely a preemptive move to manage risks of a transition from King Salman to his son, according to an analysis by Eurasia Group.

The outcome of the new oil war sparked by the failed OPEC meeting in Vienna last week is uncertain, as is the impact of coronavirus on the economic forecast for the kingdom. Economists are already predicting a substantial reduction in growth forecasts for oil exporting countries, magnified by uncertainty about the timing of global economic recovery from the virus. A prolonged downturn in global trade and travel will also affect prospects for Saudi Arabia’s ambitious Vision 2030, which is predicated on diversifying the Saudi economy away from the oil sector and toward new initiatives, including tourism.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is gearing up for two critical events later this year: the annual hajj in August and hosting the G-20 summit in November, an event that is meant to place the kingdom firmly on center stage in global leadership.

In the White House, however, MBS' brutality has been defended and even celebrated. After Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul for criticizing the regime, President Donald Trump went to bat for MBS, <span><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/29/trump-mbs-khashoggi-g20-1390412">describing</a></span> his de facto rule as "like a revolution in a very positive way."</p><p>Since then, the strategy couldn't be clearer. The president is entwining the political and commercial interests of the House of Saud with the House of Trump, keeping the prince in power while enriching his own family. You might call it a quid pro quo.</p><p>Trump wants to avoid the scenario that brought the Saudi kingdom so much of its oil wealth in the first place. When Saudi Arabia was a slightly more independent power and made its own policy, rather than relying on the United Arab Emirates or Israel to call the shots, it launched an oil embargo to protest Western support for Israel during the October War in 1973, during which Egypt and Syria tried in vain to claw back territory occupied by Israel six years earlier. That restriction of oil supply, despite lasting only six months, was the beginning of a major boom in oil prices. Between 1973 and 1984, Saudi Arabia earned <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/23/books/tilting-to-riyadh.html">$661 billion</a></span> from oil sales.</p><p>Today, oil prices are crashing at the fastest rate in 30 years, the Saudi economy is tanking and MBS' rescue strategy of selling off the Saudi crown jewels—shares in the state oil company Aramco—has fallen flat too. Instead, MBS and Saudi oil are being used as weapons by the rising House of Trump to cripple the Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan economies and bring misery to tens of millions of people.</p><p>Over the weekend, talks between Russia and Saudi Arabia to agree on supply and prices of their oil broke down. Global demand for oil is particularly low due to fewer people traveling as a result of the panic caused by coronavirus, so a failure to agree on restricting supplies to keep prices up is a major threat to both economies.</p><p>MBS needs oil prices at $83 a barrel just to balance the budget, and analysts suggest prices could crash to the <span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-08/goldman-warns-oil-could-dip-into-the-20s-as-price-war-begins">$20 range</a></span> this year. But instead of restricting supply, the crown prince is flooding the market and taking prices through the floor.</p><p>It's economic suicide. But the House of Trump demands no less. And Trump is the only factor protecting MBS' iron grip on the Saudi state right now. So the brutal crown prince has to play the role of Trump's enforcer, burning his own budget while Trump attempts to choke other oil-producing economies to force regime change in Tehran and Caracas, while sparking a dangerous economic war with Moscow.</p><p>MBS and the House of Trump have come to share allies and enemies. Closest in their circle of trust are Israel and the UAE</p><p>The House of Trump is playing with fire. There have been a string of very obvious favors for MBS since Trump came to power. </p><p>What's the House of Trump getting in return?

Both political and gas market volatility threaten to keep it that way.</p><p>The years in which Yemen LNG enjoyed successful operations were a different era not only for Yemen itself, but for gas markets around the world. Since gas exports have halted, the United States has emerged as a major LNG exporter along with Australia, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/shale-gas-swamps-asia-pushing-lng-prices-to-record-lows-11580994013">oversupplied gas markets </a>around the world have caused global gas prices to plummet. Even without the current reduction in demand that is directly attributable to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-02-17/coronavirus-is-hitting-natural-gas-more-than-oil-says-omv-ceo-video">effects of the coronavirus </a>outbreak, LNG markets are changing. Should prices remain at their historic lows for the foreseeable future, the cost of liquefaction at Yemen LNG may not provide enough incentive for the project to restart.</p><p>This problem may be compounded by the fractious Yemeni political environment. Were Yemeni gas exports to resume, determining how to distribute revenue would be a complicated process, especially given that Yemen’s gas reserves are concentrated in one governorate, Marib, but exported from another, Shabwa.</p><p>The Yemeni energy industry is nowhere near the size of its regional neighbors in the Gulf – oil production peaked at 197,000 barrels per day in 2013, according to BP.</p><p>There is also the question of whether natural gas will play a significant role in the rebuilding of Yemen’s power infrastructure. If Yemeni gas exports are not profitable in international markets, Yemen’s government may decide to allocate the country’s gas resources to the domestic power sector – a decision that would effectively end any prospect of Yemen LNG restarting its operations. However, electrification rates in Yemen were low even before the recent conflict began, and crude oil made up the majority of Yemen’s power generation capacity. Further, Yemenis have developed solutions to the lack of reliable electricity services, notably with imported solar panels.</p><p>The prospects for Yemen to recover its lost revenue stream from LNG exports appear bleak, especially in light of the price war that broke out in early March. Neither international nor domestic circumstances are conducive to restarting a project in which revenue distribution would be extremely complex to manage with little to no guarantee of profitability.</p><p><span><a href="https://agsiw.org/will-yemen-be-a-gas-exporter-again/">https://agsiw.org/will-yemen-be-a-gas-exporter-again/</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp14 Terrorismus / Terrorism</span></h2><p><span>(* B T)</span></p><p>The Salafi-Jihadi Movement in Yemen</p><p>New al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) emir Khaled Batarfi will likely strengthen AQAP by cohering the organization internally before planning external attacks.</p><p>An AQAP religious official confirmed the death of former emir Qasim al Raymi, whom a US airstrike <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51409581">killed</a> in January, and announced Batarfi as Raymi’s successor on February 23.<a href="https://www.criticalthreats.org/briefs/yemen-file/AQAP-Emir-Rallies-Group-Under-New-Leadership#_edn00effa8a19cf656c544cc2f20a16d2ef1">[1]</a> Batarfi’s past experience includes planning external operations for the group, potentially indicating that AQAP will continue its <a href="https://www.criticalthreats.org/briefs/yemen-file/yemen-file-february-12-2020">recent reinvigorated support for attacks outside of Yemen</a>.

coalition's so-called "Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT)", which claims to "investigate" Saudi coalition air raids ans attacks in Yemen. But, these "investigations" are a scam: The only purpose of all of this is whitewashing.</p><p>(A K P)</p><p>July 1, 2015, Saada</p><p>A statement issued by the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) refutes some claims regarding incidents in Yemen</p><p>The official spokesman of the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) in Yemen Legal Counsellor Mansour Al-Mansour refuted a number of claims raised by global bodies, international organizations and media outlets on errors allegedly committed by the Coalition Forces for the Support of Legitimacy in Yemen during their military operations inside Yemen.<br /> In a press conference held at the Armed Forces Officers Club in Riyadh, Al-Mansour reviewed today the results of assessing five incidents included in those claims as follows:<br /> A statement issued by the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) regarding the claim that the Coalition Forces targeted a (building) in (Saada) With regard to what was stated in the report of Amnesty International issued in (October 2015) that on the night of the first of July, (M.

T.), who works as a vegetables and fruits seller, and wounded six members of the family of (M. H.), and wounded three men who were working to repair the family's home. In light of that, JIAT found that the procedures taken by Coalition Forces, in dealing with the legitimate military target (building) in which Al-Houthi armed militia leaders and elements were meeting to plan combat operations in (Saada) were correct and in accordance with the International Humanitarian Law and its customary rules.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=2045272">https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=2045272</a></span></p><p>My remark: I did not find any evidence for this raid.</p><p>(A K P)</p><p>A statement issued by the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) refutes some claims regarding incidents in Yemen 2 Riyadh</p><p>Aug. 31, 2019: Detention center, former college, Dhamar</p><p>A statement issued by the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) regarding the claim that the coalition forces targeted a building complex that was previously (a community college) in (Dhamar) on (31/08/2019)<br /> With regard to what was stated in:<br /> 1.

Furthermore, the Yemeni armed forces have stated that the Houthi militias have contravened international law by using banned landmines and randomly mining civilian homes and farms.</p><p>Brigadier General Muhsen Khadruf of the Yemeni Army stated the following: “When the population returns home after the coup, as happened in Marib, they will find mines hidden in their refrigerators, in their cupboards, on their doors, and around their farms. The militias’ use of anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines breaches international humanitarian law. Their weapons are designed to savagely kill.”</p><p>The Human Rights Watch has denounced these atrocities and condemned the actions of the pro-Iranian Houthi militias for their role in the death and maiming of hundreds of civilians, and for the displacement of those living in affected areas.</p><p>The Arab Federation of Human Rights, in their report, estimated that over 500,000 anti-personnel mines have been placed across Yemen by the Houthi rebels, killing over 700 people thus far.
