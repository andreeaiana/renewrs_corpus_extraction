The <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/united-states">United States</a></span>, United Kingdom, France, and other weapons suppliers have risked complicity in abuses through arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other coalition governments. The United Nations has warned that without a dramatic change in the situation, nearly half of Yemen’s population will be at risk of starvation.</p> <p>“The Saudi-led coalition and Houthi forces have indiscriminately attacked, forcibly disappeared, and blocked food and medicine to Yemeni civilians,” said <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-leah-whitson">Sarah Leah Whitson</a></span>, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Governments around the globe can either do nothing while millions sink closer toward famine or use the leverage at their disposal to press the warring parties to end their abuses and impose sanctions on those obstructing aid.”</p> <p>Yemen’s armed conflict has taken a terrible toll on the population. Fighting has killed and wounded thousands of civilians. Millions suffer from shortages of food and medical care, yet the warring parties continue impeding aid. Across the country, civilians suffer from a lack of basic services, a spiraling economic crisis, and broken governance, health, education, and judicial systems.</p> <p>The coalition has conducted scores of indiscriminate and disproportionate airstrikes killing thousands of civilians and hitting critical infrastructure and other civilian structures in violation of the laws of war. Houthi forces have recruited children, used landmines and fired artillery and rockets indiscriminately into cities such as Taizz and Aden, and into Saudi Arabia. Houthi forces, government-affiliated forces, and the <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates">United Arab Emirates</a></span> (UAE) and UAE-backed Yemeni forces have arbitrarily detained or forcibly disappeared scores of people.

Everything that happens to human beings is personal both to victims and perpetrators, albeit in different ways. </p> <p>What would it be like to be stripped to the bare bones of survival because of the deliberate and calculating actions of someone more powerful than you who views you with contempt because of who you are? What would it be like to be treated like you are piece of garbage, a nothing, by someone who is so much more powerful than you that he can do anything he wants to you? It isn’t that hard to imagine and right now this is life and reality for many people around the world, including the Palestinian people. </p> <p>Britain took advantage of a natural disaster that caused a devastating failure of potato crops not only in Ireland but elsewhere in Europe to reduce the population of Ireland and break its resistance to British colonial rule. The potato blight that swept through Ireland left millions starving. The genocide saw the Brits ship food out of Ireland deliberately, while the local people were starving. Starving people were cold-heartedly evicted out of their dwellings into the harsh and cold countryside because they were too poor to pay rent to well-nourished English and English-sponsored landlords who stole and colonized Irish land and lived in comfort and warmth. Millions, entire families, were made homeless for no reason at all and no fault of their own. They were victims of the cruelty of the ruling classes of an Empire that wanted their land. They were thrown out with nothing, starving and barefoot like useless bits of rubbish with nothing to eat, and many died.</p> <p>Dehumanization is a common tactic all colonizers and settler-colonizers have been using throughout human history. All colonizers and genocidal regimes convince themselves (and all the bystanders out there) that they are not committing any crime, that in killing millions of their fellow human beings they are in fact doing something virtuous, essential and even godly. It is necessary to dehumanize victims so the job of harming, killing and displacing them is not only made easier but is in fact possible at all. Most people would not harm one another when they feel empathy and relate to each other’s experience. Colonizers do a good job convincing large sections of their own population and outsiders to turn off the empathy switch. They would not be able to carry out atrocities otherwise.</p> <p>Britain managed to reduce the indigenous population of Ireland by half, and even after the worst of it was over, the population of Ireland kept declining. </p> <p>Halving the population of a country that you colonize is one effective way to try to prevent resistance. The British ruling classes wanted Ireland not for natural resources but for strategic advantage. But regardless of the reasons that might lead one group of people to invade the land of another, colonizers and settler-colonizers are always abusive and parasitical opportunists. They invade, they take over, they turn people against one another, they suck the land and its population dry, they steal from and discard the host, or at least try to.</p> <p>We see one such case unfolding in Palestine right in front of our noses and no one is doing anything about it.

The group’s founder, Nabil Fadel, told The Associated Press that he received information from families, former female detainees, and other sources showing that over the past months, the Houthis have been rounding up women over allegations of prostitution and collaboration with the Saudi-led coalition, which is at war with the rebels.</p> <p>A Yemeni rights lawyer on Thursday told the AP the women were rounded up from cafes and parks the past months. Speaking on condition of anonymity for fears for personal safety, he said their families are searching for their missing daughters.</p> <p>The Yemeni anti-trafficking group said it obtained new information showing that the rebels were carrying out atrocities such as “abuse, torture, and forced disappearances of women and girls in secret and illegal prisons.”</p> <p>Fadel, of the anti-trafficking group, said the arrests started after the Houthi appointment a year ago of Sultan Zabin as head of the Sanaa criminal investigation division.</p> <p>Zabin promptly launched a crackdown on prostitution and smuggling. Women who had been rounded up in the crackdown and subsequently granted release were sent to secret detentions in villas across the Yemeni capital, instead of being set free – by Maggie Michael</p> <p><span><a href="https://apnews.com/0b4af81e4c1a4e5abce813d5eacdd975">https://apnews.com/0b4af81e4c1a4e5abce813d5eacdd975</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/yemeni-group-houthi-rebels-hold-torture-female-detainees/4746943.html">https://www.voanews.com/a/yemeni-group-houthi-rebels-hold-torture-female-detainees/4746943.html</a></span></p> <p><span>and shorter </span><span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/houthi-rebels-yemen-women-torture-disappear-conflict-a8733631.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/houthi-rebels-yemen-women-torture-disappear-conflict-a8733631.html</a></span></p> <p><span>Comment: </span>All sides in this war are using torture and abusing women's rights.

Das geht aus einem neuen Bericht hervor, der aufzeigt, dass die Beteiligung der USA am Konflikt viel größer ist, als offiziell dargestellt.</p> <p>Das Zentralkommando der US-Luftwaffe (AFCENT) nahm ein halbes Dutzend F-16-Kampfflugzeuge der Emirate spezialisierte Red-Flag-Trainingsübungen auf. AFCENT "unterstützte 150 Piloten bei der Vorbereitung auf Kampfhandlungen im Jemen", heißt es in einem offiziellen Memo der US-Luftwaffe vom 18. Dezember 2017. Das AFCENT-Dokument wurde durch eine Anfrage unter Bezugnahme auf das Informationsfreiheitsgesetz publik, berichtete <em><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/despite-denials-documents-reveal-u-s-training-uae-forces-combat-yemen-171513437.html">Yahoo News am Donnerstag</a></em>.</p> <p><span>Die neuen Dokumente beweisen, dass die US-Armee bei der Unterstützung von Bombenbodenzielen umfangreicher beteiligt ist als bisher bekannt.</span></p> <p><span>Das Memo legt nahe, dass die Kampfpiloten der Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate auf der al-Dhafra Luftwaffenbasis fortgebildet wurden, die von der US Air Force betrieben wird. "Das Einheitenjägerpersonal hat das F-16-Kampfflugzeugpilotenausbildungsprogramm der VAE vorangetrieben; drei Piloten flogen 243 Instrukteureinsätze/323 Stunden, die vier neue Instruktoren und 29 Kampfpiloten hervorbrachten, die sofort für Kampfeinsätze im Jemen eingesetzt wurden", heißt es im Memo.</span></p> <p><span>Die Ausbildung sei im Wesentlichen ein Bestandteil der Kriegsanstrengungen, so William Hartung, Direktor des Rüstungs- und Sicherheitsprojekts am Zentrum für Internationale Politik. "Die Ausbildung von Piloten, die zivile Ziele im Jemen bombardieren, ist eine weitere Form der Komplizenschaft der USA in einem brutalen Krieg, der viel zu lange andauert", sagte Hartung und fuhr fort:</span></p> <p><span>Wenn es der Trump-Regierung ernst damit ist, Saudi-Arabien und die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate dazu zu bringen, in gutem Glauben über den Frieden im Jemen zu verhandeln, sollten sie die Ausbildung und andere Formen der militärischen Unterstützung einstellen, bis sie ihren Teil zur Beendigung des Krieges beitragen.</span></p> <p><span>Ein Vertreter des US-Zentralkommandos, Oberstleutnant Josh Jacques, wies gegenüber Yahoo News jedoch jegliche Involvierung am Jemen-Krieg zurück. Im offenen Widerspruch zum AFCENT-Memo behauptete er:</span></p> <p>„Wir führen keine Übungen mit Mitgliedern der [von Saudi-Arabien geführten Koalition] durch, um sie auf Kampfeinsätze im Jemen vorzubereiten.“</p> <p>Ähnlich äußerte sich <span><a href="https://twitter.com/missy_ryan/status/1070797347251216384">US-Generalstabschef Joseph Dunford</a></span>. Dieser gab an, dass die USA "weder Teilnehmer am Bürgerkrieg im Jemen sind, noch unterstützen wir die eine oder andere Seite".</p> <p>Ein Trainingsprogramm für Piloten der VAE durchzuführen, "die zivile Ziele im Jemen bombardieren, ist eine weitere Form der Komplizenschaft der USA in einem brutalen Krieg, der schon viel zu lange andauert", sagte William Hartung.</p> <p>Der jemenitische Politikanalyst und Journalist Mareb al-Ward kommentierte auf Anfrage von RT Deutsch über die widersprüchliche Haltung der US-Seite:</p> <p>„Die Erklärung dürfte sein, dass die US-Regierung internen und externen Druck sowie Kritik über ihre Unterstützung der arabischen Koalition wegen der Ereignisse im Jemen vermeiden will, insbesondere nach der Ankündigung, dass Washington die Treibstoffversorgung für die Koalitionsflugzeuge eingestellt hat“ – von Ali Özkök</p> <p><span><a href="https://deutsch.rt.com/der-nahe-osten/82685-neue-dokumente-enthuellen-us-ausbildung-vae-kampfpiloten-jemen-krieg/">https://deutsch.rt.com/der-nahe-osten/82685-neue-dokumente-enthuellen-us-ausbildung-vae-kampfpiloten-jemen-krieg/</a></span></p> <p><span>Mein Komméntar: Wer schweigt sich zu diesem Thema aus?

For that call to be effective, the US government is required to shift its present course of actions with a three-pronged strategy:</p> <p>- Back the ceasefire in order to allow humanitarian assistance into the country.</p> <p>Financing aid while continuing the air campaign is as a cynical manoeuvre by the US and its Saudi allies that do not know where to bomb next. For this aid to reach vulnerable populations, both the US and Saudi Arabia must respect the ceasefire and stop bombing the war-torn country.</p> <p>- Allow the UN as a mediator and give up on hosting one-sided political talks in Riyadh or elsewhere in Europe. Riyadh is clearly no acceptable destination for Ansarullah, and would likely be contentious for almost all other Yemeni factions. Instead, the US should capitalize on the impartial stance taken by the UN toward the conflict and ask them to facilitate a dialogue – without any interference.</p> <p>- Take responsibility for the destruction and help the UN in its reconstruction and development vision for Yemen.</p> <p>If the US wants to truly demonstrate a “Yemen resolve to act alone,” it needs to show that Yemenis can rebuild their country devastated by this illegal conflict - one that, unlike war-torn Libya, Syria, or Iraq, might be salvageable.</p> <p>The US should build upon the UN resolution to secure and finance a long-term reconstruction plan for Yemen. The plan should be based on the ultimate objective of integrating Yemen within the UN, making use of its human and natural resources and capitalizing on its strategic coastline.</p> <p>To that end, the US government must not write a check to the Saudis and leave Riyadh to sort Yemen out on their own.

These people – many of whom hold the highest positions of authority on either side of the frontlines, and indeed often cooperate with each other across those frontlines – have little incentive to end the war. As such, there is a high likelihood that they will act as spoilers in any peace process, such as that which the United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, is currently pursuing at talks between the warring parties in Sweden. A successful outcome of any peace efforts in Yemen requires that these war profiteers are taken into account. Measures must be introduced – such as sanctions – to counter these individuals’ incentive and ability to continue the war, or to try to destabilize the country in the event that a peace agreement is signed.</p> <p>As <a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/6602">a year-long Sana’a Center investigation found</a>, perceived adversaries in Yemen’s war have often cooperated for personal profit. Over the past three and a half years, and under the cover of violence and failing diplomacy, complex and fluid networks of corruption have transcended active frontlines. Among the clearest example of this has been the flow of Saudi-led military coalition weapons to Houthi forces. At the heart of this particular money-making scheme are senior Yemeni anti-Houthi military commanders on the Saudi or Emirati payroll. After vastly inflating the number of soldiers in their ranks to receive excess salaries and armaments from their patrons, they then sell their weapons surplus across the frontlines to the same Houthi forces they are meant to be fighting.</p> <p>These networks of corruption extend beyond Yemen’s borders. </p> <p><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6732">http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/6732</a></p> <p>referring to <a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/6602">http://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/6602</a> (already linked in Yemen War Mosaic 477, cp1)</p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp3 Humanitäre Lage / Humanitarian situation</span></h2> <p><span>Siehe / Look at cp1</span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span>Ärzte ohne Grenzen, Film: </span>Frauen im Jemen</p> <p>"Wie sind diese Frauen, über die anscheinend alle Welt denkt, dass sie schwach sind?"

I see their suffering every day while working on the ground in Yemen. The only way to end this suffering is to end the conflict. It is therefore a shame if national parliaments keep giving the green light to continued sales of military equipment to the Saudi-led coalition.</p> <p>Nearly four years since the brutal conflict in Yemen escalated, 14 million people are at risk of famine. That number has increased dramatically since the Saudi-led coalition imposed a blockade on Yemen in November 2017. We are horrified that as many as 85,000 children may have died because of extreme hunger since the war began. For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death—and it’s entirely preventable.</p> <p>While western countries are providing aid to Yemen to alleviate human suffering with one hand, with the other they are selling weapons and equipment being used in this conflict to kill, maim and starve children. This is a double standard which keeps fueling this devastating conflict.</p> <p>Independent journalists recently traced the origin of weapons that ended up on Yemen’s battlefields—and the countries of origin include Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, the US, and others.</p> <p>Save the Children has provided food for 575,000 children and treated more than 152,000 children for malnutrition since the start of the crisis. Despite tough challenges, we’re saving lives every day. Fighting, blockades and bureaucracy have forced Save the Children to bring vital supplies for the the country’s north through the southern port of Aden. As a result, it can take up to three weeks for aid to reach those who urgently need it.</p> <p>Our teams on the ground meet families bringing in their severely malnourished and unresponsive children to our health clinics, desperate to save them. There is nothing worse than watching a child die of starvation while food is prevented from entering the country and violence hinders its distribution.

Included in those shipments are Direct Relief Emergency Health Kits, which contain life-saving essential medicines and supplies.</p> <p>Cholera Treatment Kits have also been sent to combat the cholera outbreak that infected over 1.1 million people.</p> <p>Emergency Medical Backpacks have also been sent to equip Yemen Aid’s mobile medical teams providing care in conflict zones across rebel-held territories.</p> <p>To help address this medical access crisis, Direct Relief has partnered with Yemen Aid to build the “Pink Clinic,” the first ever breast and cervical cancer early detection center in the southern city of Lahj.</p> <p>The newly renovated clinic is now open to the public and doctors see women from the provinces of Aden, Lahj, Abyan and Al Dhale arriving to receive free breast and cervical cancer screenings provided by trained nurses of the National Cancer Control Foundation.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.directrelief.org/2019/01/yemen-delivering-health-in-a-conflict-zone/">https://www.directrelief.org/2019/01/yemen-delivering-health-in-a-conflict-zone/</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-delivering-health-conflict-zone">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-delivering-health-conflict-zone</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span>Film: </span>Sami Hamid, 1,6 months years old , a situation like the case of the rest of Yemen's children suffering from war and siege, Sami suffers from malnutrition and heart problems his family don't have the cost of treatment, also don't have the strength to feed Sami and other children, Your Abilities Organization for Development brought the child Sami with his parents from a remote rural area is #Aslam in #Hajjah Governorate to the capital Sana'a to treat the child and save his life.<br /><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/your.abilities.or/videos/412269406179619/">https://www.facebook.com/your.abilities.or/videos/412269406179619/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span>Film: </span>A documentary short film shows part of the tragedy the innocent people are dying who need to travel abroad for Treatment, As a result of the closure of <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/sanaa?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAloid66XJYyM16yYwpwD1vzE4cRT4njhSb6AsFKyw44-0-wa_WtohfPoVSO4JCmAB0P9jmWMlOivS2r7cUgbbmUaPuLLgbpYEXbJ0z3SdtiUGdXnvQ-TbzZgMy7fbA7sd4CwgUjdEF4Vq30SyvVg_ewHenG5ZoVhHuS41M-PNbBXVlqUmdF1t_Z_IeJ24_XpfRaa9F-N2oq8VuruJTFRSbS0kcD7gpku1C29lj4I5OBmHbfSB2Vm9cLLyUeUX3n3ciOAcdvU3i_kmjxvAoZltNP7SfAnAmTzPDRzYQahlnSxPZLcjIGUCEVz7mVOJ-c2wY5PUKVWF9hSCDOHPlNkSWkg&amp;__tn__=%2ANK-R">#Sanaa</a></span> Int'l Airport.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ6ivq00RBc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ6ivq00RBc</a></span></p> <p><span>(A H)</span></p> <p>Canadian Defenders For Human Rights, in partnership with the <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Yemenicanada/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBg1wj_VZ748ZJuECxLwvbe0EpAwo20zk2Zc3uKXgEYEcNmg97bsei4WxeY2kLN6juHKbmfRt2mhhsNjn_Q7LylE41akTOd9axE0J4D3gFgA3Dymu2aoRFtPeQ8b7-n_5xUcAL53EXtGN6-LLuc_ewScMHzMSn-7c4cKedh336GIlNZsp92f9A57GDinDKOMZy--iYLKwz8W8PO3qS4b2l_liI2FqwCsDXZmkxRCW028Kn_dN-C7fW98BTNEy5vl7EnsEP13jKuDRaMawq15Zn7LV74rY4mLeOHcMFeymPVJcSVM3qH2iFaf7vI_1Yi9JkCe3_yQTLaiqJmN90GiNiJ8TXnfzYKw5uXcVkaiIAdD4fDTJ682vasA22-RihkDZmPLxAAk8wqYPK55ePHqgvBXB2K-7Dzs1MXDKkDpks-zM-nCSu-5s3Wv1F9gHzUBg7kz00KnGjFdLCU_h94N1dzXG3YLFJftMHz_AULuJn9CadAEEBcpw&amp;__xts__%5B1%5D=68.ARBd0Q1xDbLzWVWuOOg2aGzs9oLG3rFpAR4sn-5UOLwCmj3Xlyq3wjgpteAyXbvEQVM-5gwU4kd8iKcNPphJGHWahvlJpGxo4VCpsBZFs8fHpEyoo99AwoKZHMnQ0UDX1xAkiZ4c4r3pdlKhfykpzvjvVtDorzenrhQUAXBX9EcuxjzCjt7gBkJBKlsOJg0XZcwFBaOZ4aXVDFYGxPzI7BydLHfvyqx-RSy06J_VCoPmMJuzXTVrHWWeILHK1AGcnIwFj4c8bBsL7JsQwi4iaiwpawbyolqcXbqnTeW28vz_SgjPi4VSfNpQzWqJln7Mh8kNHl50OmWKD3mC1-lbbtg&amp;__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARB9gGJf3eaj9B-TX0YoHUjERLavPrdr6iggZWh5lNgJrCVBafOd9pvrl52CEs6CvNlVcrALqXaSLrPN&amp;fref=mentions">Yemeni Community in Canada</a></span>, distributed warm blankets to 120 families in the city of Hajjah, Yemen on January 16, 2019.

Sa’ada and Hajjah governorates are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), which is associated with large food consumption gaps and/or extreme depletion of livelihood assets. Of the remaining governorates in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), six would be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) in the absence of ongoing assistance.</li> <li>Between December 2018 and January 2019, large areas will remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), as large-scale assistance prevents a deterioration to Emergency (IPC Phase 4) in many areas. In the most likely scenario, humanitarian food assistance will continue through early 2019 and large areas will remain in Crisis through May 2019.</li> <li>While ceasefires have recently been announced in Al Hudaydah, FEWS NET’s most likely scenario is based on the assumption that conflict will continue. As such, the potential for continued conflict near Al Hudaydah City remains concerning. </li> </ul><p>Based on June 2018 data from the Task Force on Population Movement, approximately 2.3 million people were displaced across Yemen, and an additional 424,000 were displaced by late August 2018, largely due to conflict in Al Hudaydah, Sana’a City, and Hajjah governorates. According to UNHCR, nearly 90 percent of IDPs have been displaced for more than one year. Ta’izz, Hajjah, Sana’a City, Ibb, and Amran are estimated to have the highest populations of displaced people.</p> <p><span><a href="http://fews.net/east-africa/yemen/food-security-outlook/december-2018">http://fews.net/east-africa/yemen/food-security-outlook/december-2018</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-food-security-outlook-december-2018-may-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-food-security-outlook-december-2018-may-2019</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/ocha">UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a></span>: Yemen Humanitarian Update Covering 13 December 2018 – 15 January 2019 | Issue 1</p> <p>KEY ISSUES:</p> <p>Humanitarian partners assisted about 1 million people displaced by conflict in Al Hudaydah Governorate in the last six months.

People in Yemen face continuous suffering, but little action is being taken to support them,” said Dr. Fawziah Al-Ammar, a psychology expert who traveled from Sana’a, passing through innumerable dangerous checkpoints so that she could speak at the UN.</p> <p>The Clinic and the Sana’a Center shared with the UN their recent report Mental Health in Yemen: A Neglected Crisis, and their research on the magnitude of psychological distress in Yemen. “80 percent of children in Sana’a show symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Thisis an alarming statistic and if governments do not act, there is a risk of long-term, multigenerational harm,” Dr. Al-Ammar told governments at the UN who were meeting to discuss Yemen’s human rights record.</p> <p>There is a dire lack of mental health service providers in Yemen, and the government itself has no mental health policy. This neglect will potentially impact generations of Yemenis, as poor mental health can affect family structures, social cohesion, physical health, educational outcomes, and even reduce support for peaceful solutions to conflict.</p> <p>“Sustainable peace and a positive future for Yemen require that urgent steps be taken to respond to the mental health crisis,” said Waleed Alhariri, director of the US office of the Sana’a Center, and fellow-in-residence at Columbia Law School Human Rights Institute. “Mental health must be incorporated into Yemen’s peace processes and agreements.”</p> <p>The Clinic and the Sana’a Center also recommended that the Government of Yemen create a national mental health policy, ensure budget allocation for health services, and that the Sana’a airport be re-opened and salaries for public health sectors be paid, to reduce hardship on Yemenis.</p> <p><span><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/news/6757">http://sanaacenter.org/publications/news/6757</a> </span></p> <p><span>referring to </span><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/6789">http://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/6789</a> (had been linked in Yemen War Mosaic 502, cp1)</p> <p><span>(* B H)</span></p> <p>Yemen WASH Cluster Assessment Zingibar District, Abyan Governorate, Yemen November 2018</p> <p>Yemen is facing one of the world’s worst Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) crises, as deteriorating WASH infrastructure contributes to a cholera outbreak, and represents one of the underlying causes of malnutrition in the country.</p> <p>On behalf of the Yemen WASH Cluster, REACH coordinated a household-level assessment to provide an understanding of WASH needs, gaps, and priorities in 38 districts prioritized for famine and/or cholera interventions that also host a high concentration of Internally Displaced People (IDPs - 8% or more of the total district population).</p> <p>Findings are based on data collection conducted from 4 September to 28 November 2018.</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-zingibar-district-abyan-governorate-yemen-november-2018">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-zingibar-district-abyan-governorate-yemen-november-2018</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-mudhaykhirah-district-ibb-governorate-yemen-november-2018">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-mudhaykhirah-district-ibb-governorate-yemen-november-2018</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-mustaba-district-hajjah-governorate-yemen-november-2018">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-mustaba-district-hajjah-governorate-yemen-november-2018</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-qarah-district-hajjah-governorate-yemen-november-2018">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-qarah-district-hajjah-governorate-yemen-november-2018</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-tuban-district-lahj-governorate-yemen-november-2018">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-tuban-district-lahj-governorate-yemen-november-2018</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-sharab-salam-district-taizz-governorate-yemen-november">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-sharab-salam-district-taizz-governorate-yemen-november</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-marib-city-district-marib-governorate-yemen-november-2018">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-wash-cluster-assessment-marib-city-district-marib-governorate-yemen-november-2018</a> </span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp4 Flüchtlinge / Refugees</span></h2> <p><span>(* A H)</span></p> <p>Two displaced persons died from the extreme cold wave in Marib camps</p> <p>A medical source reported that two displaced people died as a result of the extreme cold wave in a camp in Marib province.

Mission to Support Ceasefire between Yemen’s Government, Houthi Militia</p> <p>Permanent Representative Says Text Reaffirms Support for Yemen’s Independence</p> <p>The Security Council today decided to establish a special political mission to support implementation of the ceasefire agreement reached in Stockholm on 13 December 2018 between the Government of Yemen and the Houthi militia covering the city and port of Hodeidah, as well as the ports of Salif and Ras Issa.</p> <p>Unanimously adopting resolution 2452 (2019), the Council decided that the United Nations Mission to support the Hodeidah Agreement (UNMHA) — with an initial mandate of six months — will lead and support the Redeployment Coordination Commission tasked with overseeing the ceasefire, redeployment of forces and mine action operations.</p> <p>It will monitor compliance with the ceasefire, work with the parties to ensure that security is assured by local security forces, in line with Yemeni law, and coordinate United Nations efforts to assist the parties in fully implementing the Agreement.</p> <p>Through the text, submitted by the United Kingdom, the Council — approving the Secretary-General’s proposals on the Mission’s composition and operational aspects — said UNMHA will be headed by the Chair of the Redeployment Coordination Commission, who will report through the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen and the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs.</p> <p>Abdullah Ali Fadhel al-Saadi (Yemen) welcomed the resolution, saying it reaffirmed international support for Yemen’s independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty, while stressing the need for a comprehensive and lasting peace that meets the aspirations of the Yemeni people. Emphasizing that his Government is fully committed to supporting implementation of the Agreement, he urged the Council and the international community to monitor ongoing ceasefire violations by the Houthi militia, supported by Iran, which have claimed 41 lives and injured 396 people. The Council must condemn such violations, he said.</p> <p>[follows: Resolution in full]</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/sc13664.doc.htm">https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/sc13664.doc.htm</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/adopting-resolution-2452-2019-security-council-establishes-special-political-mission">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/adopting-resolution-2452-2019-security-council-establishes-special-political-mission</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: The UN is in danger to fail as long as it stays this biased as it is.

It sets the scene as a team of Saudi operatives lay their plans before Mr. Khashoggi arrives, and then recounts what happened next.</p> <p>The three journalists, Abdurrahman Simsek, Nazif Karaman and Ferhat Unlu, work for an investigative unit at the pro-government newspaper Sabah, and are known for their close ties to Turkish intelligence. They said that they did not have access to the audio recordings but were briefed by intelligence officials who did.</p> <p>A Turkish security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed separately that the details described in the book were accurate. The book, “Diplomatic Atrocity: The Dark Secrets of the Jamal Khashoggi Murder,” is written in Turkish and went on sale in December.</p> <p>The reporters identify one of the officials on the tapes as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/world/middleeast/khashoggi-saudi-prince.html?module=inline">a security official and frequent companion</a></span> of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Mr. Mutreb is heard giving orders and directing the conversation with Mr. Khashoggi, the book says.</p> <p>Turkish officials identified Mr. Mutreb and others through sound analysis, the reporters write.</p> <p>They say it was Mr. Mutreb who laid out the plan to Salah al-Tubaigy, <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-turkey.html?module=inline">a top forensic official</a></span> of the Saudi government, telling him they would try to take Mr. Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia. If Mr. Khashoggi resisted, “We will kill him here and get rid of the body,” Mr. Mutreb told Mr. Tubaigy, according to the book.</p> <p>“Jamal is tall, around 1.80 meters,” Mr. Tubaigy is quoted as saying. “The joints of a sacrificial animal are easily split, but dismembering still will take time.”</p> <p>“I always worked on cadavers,” he said. “I know how to cut well. I have never worked on a warm body until now, but I can handle that easily. Normally while working on a cadaver, I put on my headphones and listen to music.

The American government lead by this new Congress can show it is serious about attempts by foreign governments to hack persons in United States, like myself.

As the report noted, the shells “landed in an open lot and harmed no one,” but the group that fired them is alleged to have ties with Iran.</p> <p>This incident, though minor, notably took place amid considerable unrest in the Iraqi city of Basra and during competing efforts by the U.S. and Iran to influence the formation of Iraq’s next national government.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the minor nature of the incident was apparently the perfect pretext for Bolton and others on the national security team – which Bolton<span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/fred-fleitz-john-bolton-national-security-council/243272/"> has been stocking</a></span> with war hawks<span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/the-nscs-newest-member-set-to-aid-boltons-efforts-to-derail-korea-peace-talks/245253/"> for much of the past year</a></span> – to push for a military strike on Iran, something Bolton himself has long sought, as evidenced by his numerous speeches and editorials calling for preemptive bombing of the Islamic Republic.</p> <p>For instance, in one meeting, Mira Ricardel – then serving as Bolton’s<span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2018/04/23/john-boltons-new-deputy-is-a-hawk-with-sharp-elbows-just-like-him/?utm_term=.ca45128d3aa4"> ultra-hawkish</a></span> deputy national security advisor – described the attacks in Iraq as “an act of war” and said the U.S. had to respond decisively. Ricardel is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a<span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/president-donald-j-trump-announces-key-administration-posts-2/"> former executive</a></span> of U.S. weapons-maker Boeing but left her post last November as result of friction with First Lady Melania Trump.</p> <p>In addition, during those meetings, the Journal noted that Bolton did not even attempt to hide his real motivations, as he “made it clear that he personally supports regime change in Iran, a position he aggressively championed before joining the Trump administration, according to people familiar with the discussions.”</p> <p>As a result of those meetings, the Bolton-led National Security Council pushed for an attack plan on Iran so brazen that it deeply concerned Pentagon and State Department officials. One former senior U.S. administration official told the Journal that the request “definitely rattled people” and added that “people were shocked. It was mind-boggling how cavalier they were about hitting Iran.”</p> <p>In other words, using a remarkably minor incident as a pretext, the Bolton-led group of hawks that compose the majority of Trump’s National Security Council (NSC) was preparing to launch a full-scale regime-change war on Iran. To make matter worse, the Journal also reported that the Pentagon had “complied with the NSC’s request to develop options for striking Iran,” meaning that Bolton and his team now have a range of Pentagon-developed strategies for bombing Iran at their fingertips.</p> <p>Bolton’s obsession and unkept promise</p> <p>Bolton ‘s push to bomb Iran last September over such a minor incident may seem strange, but Bolton’s history makes it clear that he has long sought any excuse – from the minor to the non-existent – to justify waging war against Iran’s current government – by Whitney Webb</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/john-bolton-radical-reshaping-plan-mideast-included-mind-boggling-strikes-iran-syria-iraq/253826/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/john-bolton-radical-reshaping-plan-mideast-included-mind-boggling-strikes-iran-syria-iraq/253826/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* A K P)</span></p> <p>Saudi Arabia gets US missile defense boost despite Khashoggi uproar</p> <p>The Donald Trump administration has approved nearly $200 million in upgrades to Saudi Arabia’s missile defenses, Al-Monitor has learned, despite continued congressional uproar over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p> <p>Under the commercial deal approved by the State Department in December, Saudi Arabia will receive $195 million in upgrades to improve its Patriot PAC-3 defenses, including a guidance system that increases its ability to intercept ballistic missiles able to evade US-made radars.</p> <p>Though the State Department <span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/senate-communication/115th-congress/executive-communication/7384">notified Congress</a></span> of the sale in December, it did not make the exact dollar value of the transaction public.

So there is no doubt that there’s plenty of good money in pestering politicians on behalf of the Saudis. Not only the lobbyists but for the politicians as well. CIP found that Saudi lobbying firms donated nearly $400,000 to the campaigns of members of Congress they “had contacted on behalf of Saudi interests.” And if this weren’t blatant enough, CIP identified “twelve instances in which that contact and contribution occurred on the exact same day.”</p> <p>What has Saudi Arabia gotten in return? The CIP report notes that “the timing of many of these political contributions coincides closely with key Congressional events, involving the Justice Against State Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) votes and votes to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia.” Let’s also not forget the US support, in the form of mid-air refueling and intelligence, for the Saudi-led coalition into Yemen that has led to a humanitarian disaster — complete with the <span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/mass-starvation-looms-quietly-as-civil-war-in-yemen-rages/a-45975240">threat of mass starvation </a></span>and a widespread <span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-cholera/yemen-cholera-outbreak-accelerates-to-10000-cases-per-week-who-idUSKCN1MC23J">cholera outbreak </a></span>.</p> <p> In 2017, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), the UAE <span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/fara/countries/1?cycle=2017">spent </a></span>over $21 million on US lobbying.

Während die Union darauf besteht, die Beschränkung Anfang März auslaufen zu lassen, pocht die SPD auf eine Beibehaltung des Lieferstopps.

Absolute BS! I <span>will address this report in my podcast tomorrow but before I do that I wanted to say this:</span><br /><span>While no-one is claiming that Yemen Resistance movement is an innocent white lamb ... yes abuses have been committed, Yemen let's remember is facing unparalleled military pressure and a humanitarian crisis that has literally decimated the country! </span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=788712711494851&amp;set=a.120731148293014">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=788712711494851&amp;set=a.120731148293014</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: There is no reason for whitewashing the Houthis as it’s tried here.</span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>Girl’s family matter raked to harm Saudi Arabia</p> <p>The Saudi National Society for Human Rights (NSHR) was surprised by the incitement of countries to what they described as “Saudi girls delinquents” rebellion against the values of their families and seeks to receive them under the pretext of granting them asylum.<br /> “Such methods followed by some countries and international organizations are politically motivated and not humanitarian,” said Mufleh Al-Qahtani, head of NSHR, in a press statement on Sunday.<br /> The ongoing case of the girl fleeing to Thailand due to differences with her family and being granted asylum in Canada, caused a stir in social networking sites and was exploited by several international media in an attempt to harm the Kingdom.<br /> Although the issue of the “fugitive girl” is purely a family matter, actors in the international scene, media, rights bodies and politics, tried to exploit the issue to harm the Kingdom, offend Saudi Arabia and reinforce negative stereotypes about Saudis.</p> <p><span><a href="http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/553892/SAUDI-ARABIA/Girls-family-matter-raked-to-harm-Saudi-Arabiaent">http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/553892/SAUDI-ARABIA/Girls-family-matter-raked-to-harm-Saudi-Arabiaent</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: No, this was not a mere “family matter”. In the beginning, Saudi Arabia tried to force her back. – No, these Saudi girls are no “delinquents”. Whatfore they should be “delinquents”? For leaving the country?? – When the Saudis claim such cases and Western reactions “</span>offend Saudi Arabia and reinforce negative stereotypes about Saudis", then this is the Saudis own fault as long as they keep the “male guardian” system and discrimination of women. – The twisted Saudi view is well shown by the quotation: ““This action also includes an attack on the rights of the families of these girls, who are severely harmed by the defamation following their daughter’s action that pushes them into the unknown.” No, there are no “rights of the families of these girls” as far as how and where these girls want to live. If these families are “severely harmed by the defamation following their daughters action”, this only is the fault of the Saudi society treating these cases as the families’ disgrace.</p> <p>To realize how much this is a state affair for Saudi Arabia, imagine when reading what Saudi propaganda further makes of it:</p> <p>(A P)</p> <p>What is behind the Saudi teen’s escape?</p> <p>IS there is any foreign conspiracy behind the Saudi teenager's escape or was it purely a family matter? To answer this question, I will have to write two articles discussing all aspects of the case. Therefore, I will consider this article to be the first part of the series.</p> <p>Rahaf chose her fate. Escaping to an unknown country, which is strange to her cultural environment, is an unsafe path for a girl of Rahaf's age. But it is important to protect her and calmly engage her in a dialogue, away from an atmosphere of anger and tension.<br /> I will talk about the reasons why girls escape and the problems they face in the second part of my article. I will focus here on why the issue of Rahaf was magnified in the media and her news reached all corners of Planet Earth. It is not strange that any negative news related to Saudi Arabia grabs the attention of the international media and it is used to attack Saudi Arabia. This happens whenever there is a voice that speaks against Saudi society. It is normal to differ, but it is totally unacceptable to use this difference of opinion to stab a country in the back. We should never let our problems to degrade the reputation of our society.<br /> What really happened and caused this international escalation? Did this girl do what she did on her own volition because of her ignorance and innocence, or was she misguided by someone?</p> <p>We would have done better in dealing with this case. What we need to do now is to activate crisis management and to train spokesmen who can speak on behalf of the country and really understand how to deal with a problem. There is a huge difference when someone says, "It is a family issue", or "She is a Saudi citizen and we need to stay by her". With due respect to everyone and all the efforts made, I want to emphasize that we should be extremely careful when dealing with international files.<br /> In the case of Rahaf, despite her mistake, we could have contained the issue quietly. Now she needs to think about what is awaiting her. She needs to realize that living in a foreign country is extremely difficult and that there is no country like home. The past year was a good year for Saudi women and many of the rules on the ground changed in her favor.<br /> The last thing I want say to Rahaf is: "No matter how big was your mistake, you have a country to come back to. Family problems can be dealt with. You need education and support, even if it means you continue your education abroad and then return home. Give yourself time to think. All what I wish for is for you to be fine and to understand that the anger of the Saudi people toward your action is not comparable with the country that loves you. The country is the mother who embraces her children when they come back home."</p> <p><span><a href="http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/553932/rss">http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/553932/rss</a> </span></p> <p><span>My comment: LOL.

This looks like Hadi government propaganda tries to put the blame for all destructions in this war on the Houthis – there cannot be any other serious explanation for this figure. But, the far most largest part of all destructions and losses is due to the Saudi coalition air raids – there had been an estimate of ca. US $ 180 billion more than a year ago. Might-be this was exaggerated, but meanwhile at least US $ 150 billion might be serious. </span></p> <p><span>(A B P T)</span></p> <p>Justice for America After Death of Long-Sought Al-Qaeda Militant</p> <p>Regimes like those in Saudi Arabia and Yemen (under Ali Abdullah Saleh, assassinated in 2017) long ago learned how to play both sides of the street with their American partner, aiding Islamic extremists with one hand while arresting them with the other. “In Yemen, it wasn’t ideology that was the problem” in keeping Badawi in prison, says Benjamin, now director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, “just the unstoppable urge of Saleh to diddle us.”</p> <p>Lisa Monaco, a veteran Justice Department national security official who rose to chief counterterrorism adviser to Obama, sounded deeply gloomy in a recent interview about U.S. prospects in the region.</p> <p>All of which “makes it harder for security services to be seen as partnering with Americans in joint training or operations,” says Price. These partnerships, Monaco told Intelligence Matters, are “critical to being able to take the fight to the terrorists abroad before they come here.” </p> <p>“Though an airstrike doesn’t do anything about terrorism’s incubators,” McFadden says, “it does show that if you remain in the jihad life, violence will be lurking.” Justice delayed, he adds, is better than no justice at all.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2019/01/25/justice-america-after-death-long-sought-al-qaeda-militant-1292321.html">https://www.newsweek.com/2019/01/25/justice-america-after-death-long-sought-al-qaeda-militant-1292321.html</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: This sounds like UN neocon hawkish bullshit.</span></p> <p><span>(B P)</span></p> <p>Hopes for peace dashed in Yemen</p> <p>The international community believes the Stockholm Agreement is the only way out of the crisis in Yemen, but the Houthi rebels seem unlikely to comply</p> <p><span><a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/26299.aspx">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/26299.aspx</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp16 Saudische Luftangriffe / Saudi air raids </span></h2> <p><span>(* A K pS)</span></p> <p>Ten Houthis killed in one district, including a prominent tribal sheikh and his two sons in Haradh</p> <p>Ten militants, including a prominent tribal leader and his two sons, were killed by an air raid by Saudi Arabia-led coalition fighters in the northern province of Hajjah, according to local sources of Al-Masdar on Thursday.</p> <p>The source added that tribal leader Abbas al-Ma'amari and his two sons died instantly, along with seven others when they were fighting among the Houthis, against government forces, before they were targeted by the air raid.</p> <p><span><a href="http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163251">http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163251</a></span></p> <p><span>(A K pH)</span></p> <p><span>More Saudi coalition air raids recorded on:</span></p> <p><span>Jan. 18: <a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news523349.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news523349.htm</a> Saada p.</span></p> <p><span>Jan. 17: </span><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=4931&amp;cat_id=1">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=4931&amp;cat_id=1</a></span><span> Saada, Hajjah, Amran p.</span></p> <p><span>Jan. 16: </span><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=4914&amp;cat_id=1">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=4914&amp;cat_id=1</a></span><span> Saada p.</span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp17 Kriegsereignisse / Theater of War</span></h2> <p>(A K pH)</p> <p>Army's drone attacks Saudi army groups in Asir</p> <p><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news523333.htm">http://www.sabanews.net/en/news523333.htm</a></p> <p>(A K pH)</p> <p>Jan. 16, saada p: Several areas of Baqim and Shida border districts were hit by Saudi missiles and artillery shells.</p> <p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=4914&amp;cat_id=1">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=4914&amp;cat_id=1</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp18 Sonstiges / Other</span></h2> <p>(* C)</p> <p>A Vision of Yemen</p> <p>The Travels of a European Orientalist and His Native Guide, A Translation of Hayyim Habshush's Travelogue</p> <p>Excerpt from chap. 1.</p> <p>D ear reader, I present you with a taste of how we lived when the sage and [1] traveler Rabbi Joseph Halévy, the Frenchman, may God preserve him, came to our holy encampment to discover the hidden secrets of the sand and the ancient Sheban language.
