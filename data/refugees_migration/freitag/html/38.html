She is the facility’s first-ever female general physician.</p><p>“As doctors, we know how disastrous it would be. We do not have the facilities or minimum health standards to treat the virus. We do not have oxygen. We do not have ventilators. We do not have intensive care units,” she said.</p><p>Yemenis are already living through the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The health system is on the verge of collapse</p><p>Yet even with the pandemic’s arrival in the country, funding for humanitarian work – including health care – is drying up.</p><p>At the start of 2020, UNFPA appealed for $100.5 million for its regular humanitarian operations in Yemen. To date, only 41 per cent of that has been mobilized, leaving a gap of $58.8 million. An additional $24 million is needed for the COVID-19 response, including protecting health workers and shoring up access to reproductive health care.</p><p>“Our priority is to ensure that access to reproductive health care for these women is not disrupted and that they are protected from violence and abuse during these difficult times. We can, however, only do so if funding is available,” said Nestor Owomunhangi, UNFPA’s acting representative in Yemen.</p><p>“Under the pandemic, attention has understandably been diverte</p><p>Vast needs among women and girls</p><p>Women and girls face serious threats to their reproductive health. Only 20 per cent of the health system is providing maternal and child health services. It is estimated that a woman dies of pregnancy- or childbirth-related complications every two hours in Yemen.</p><p>Last year, UNFPA supported 235 health facilities and 3,800 reproductive health workers. This support included essential reproductive health medicines, equipment and support with operational costs. More than 1.5 million women and girls were reached with reproductive health services as a result.</p><p>Much of this support could be rolled back if funding does not materialize by mid-May.</p><p>These shortfalls arrive just as UNFPA is trying to scale up its support to the country’s health system to address the pandemic. Women are expected to bear the brunt of a COVID-19 outbreak, should one occur.</p><p>“Five years of conflict, limited nutritional intake and low levels of immunity are making Yemeni women increasingly vulnerable to contracting COVID-19,” said Mr. Owomunhangi.</p><p>Strict gender roles mean that women and girls will likely be tasked with caring for the sick, which will put them at risk of infection. Women and girls also have less access to financial resources and decision-making, meaning they may be less able to seek health services if they fall ill.</p><p>In addition, the most basic preventative measure – handwashing – is not an option for many. More than 9.1 million women and girls need support to meet their basic water, sanitation and hygiene needs. Soaring prices and reduced purchasing power are also putting clean water and personal hygiene items out of reach for the most vulnerable.</p><p>Health workers among the hardest hit</p><p>Health workers in Yemen have already endured extraordinary trials during the country’s conflict.</p><p>“A health worker sees death more than once a day. It can be on the way to work, it can be inside the hospital,” Dr. Omar told UNFPA. Some health facilities have been the target of attacks, she said. “We lived in horror. The years to come will not be able to erase these memories.”</p><p>If the pandemic spreads widely, health workers will again find themselves at grave risk.</p><p>“We lack qualified personnel who know how to deal with the virus, and as well as we lack of protection and safety equipment for health workers and cleaners,” said Fatima Yahya Ahmed, a midwife in Abs, near front lines. “We are scared.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.unfpa.org/news/covid-19-strikes-yemen-humanitarian-funding-dries">https://www.unfpa.org/news/covid-19-strikes-yemen-humanitarian-funding-dries</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>The Viability of a Southern State in Yemen</strong></p><p>The definition of a state has long been established as a unified people sharing governance institutions within common defensible borders. By this definition, the people of south Yemen despite their strong aspirations are nowhere near having their own state. The desirability of establishing such a state aside, the practicalities on the ground demonstrate that there are many challenges ahead and obstacles to overcome should the STC, which has thus far only claimed autonomy, wish to go that route.</p><p>Lack of Unified Southerners Around the Secession</p><p>First, the people of the south are not unified, save for a common aspiration to be independent and free from northern domination as viewed and resented by them since 1994. </p><p>Today, the socialist party is no longer a factor but the STC does not have an alternative unifying ideology. What has remained however is the regionalization which still pits a political leadership mainly from Dalea’ and Lahj against sundry militias inside Aden and a population in Shabwa, Abyan and Mahra who largely do not have any allegiance to the STC.</p><p>Border Challenges</p><p>Any putative border for a southern state is also a complicated issue. The writ of the STC, even with Emirati support, does not dominate outside Aden and Dalea’, and is feeble even in Aden itself. Just north of Dalea’, Houthi forces are poised on the outskirts of Taiz and regularly menace nearby southern forces. Just to the west of Aden, starting with the small town of Shuqra, forces loyal to President Hadi are positioned in Abyan and Shabwa who nearly attacked the STC in Aden had it not been for Emirati opposition and lack of support from Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Military Power of Different Factions Threatens Independence</p><p><span><a href="https://fanack.com/yemen/history-past-to-present/understanding-balance-of-power-in-yemen/">The military balance of forces</a></span> in Yemen is not easy to quantify, but professional estimates and the locations of fighters indicates that the war cannot end in total victory for any one side of the conflict. To put the military capacity of the STC in context, the group’s armed wing faces formidable odds if pitted against the array of forces operating in Yemen.</p><p>The Hadi government, which lacks legitimacy in the south, also accounts for another army of 100,000 troops. Governed remotely from Riyadh, these troops are effectively divided in loyalty between President Hadi, his vice president General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, and those who are loyal to the Islah party. A significant portion of Yemen’s former national army, currently under the leadership of the late President Saleh’s nephews and son, is also more attached to the UAE than they are to the Yemeni government. </p><p>The Southern Resistance Army (SRA) – Southern Hirak, as the southern separatist movement is known, is now mainly led by the STC and their armed forces who are equipped, trained and supported by the UAE. With an estimated standing army of 30,000. These forces are able to dominate Yemen’s southern capital and fight on other fronts in the south, including the island of Socotra. A relatively small force, the SRA potentially includes the forces known as al-Nukhba (The Elite) based in other southern governorates. An actual alliance between all these forces, however, is not at all a given. The STC’s strength is largely political and its taking over Aden and Socotra virtually guarantee it a role in any future peace talks and will certainly be a force to reckon with when discussing the future of the south.</p><p>STC’s Capabilities to Govern</p><p>The <span><a href="https://stc-eu.org/en/sueduebergangsrat/">STC</a></span>, formed in 2017, is composed of a 26-member presidential council which includes former governors of southern districts dismissed by President Hadi in 2017. The council has also put together a 300-member assembly, but there are currently no election laws or procedures, nor does the assembly meet on a regular schedule. The STC does not have its own executive departments and its administration over Aden depends on existing ministerial offices to carry out executive orders and policies issued by the presidential council.</p><p>In terms of economic viability, the south can be self-sufficient provided the right regions are included under its authority. <span><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP89S01450R000500500001-7.pdf">Oil and gas reserves</a></span> would of course be of immense value to a southern state, but those resources are currently desired by all concerned and well-armed parties in the country. Aden is a strategic seaport of course, but it is underutilized and in need of redevelopment. </p><p>Meanwhile, the funding of the STC is entirely dependent on UAE assistance at the moment and, with central bank resources out of grasp, financial independence becomes problematic. Additionally, the STC’s administrative infrastructure is nascent while the tasks it faces in managing Aden, let alone the entire south, are enormous. The Arab coalition largesse has been intermittent throughout Yemen, with only a few flashy projects to show for which they can take credit. The challenges on the other hand are immense.</p><p>With or without foreign funds, the STC must demonstrate crisis-management skills, especially in light of the spread of COVID-19 – by Nabeel Khoury</p><p><span><a href="https://gulfif.org/the-viability-of-a-southern-state-in-yemen/">https://gulfif.org/the-viability-of-a-southern-state-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>PA-X: Yemen Timeline: Conflict Events &amp; Peace and Transition Documents</strong></p><p><span>Accounts of conflicts are often contested.

Erfolge im Kampf gegen Kinderheiraten sind selten. </span></p><p>Im Jemen werden viele <span><a href="https://www.dw.com/de/unicef-prangert-kinderehen-an/a-49095562">Mädchen zur Heirat gezwungen</a>, obgleich sie noch nicht in einem Alter sind, in dem sie eine selbstbestimmte Sexualität leben und eine Ehe führen können. Wann junge Frauen dafür als alt genug gelten, ist im Jemen bis heute nicht klar gesetzlich geregelt. Und so werden minderjährige Mädchen weiterhin in die Ehe gezwungen - eine Praxis, die sich in dem seit Jahren andauernden Krieg noch einmal verstärkt hat. Das stellte im April eine Arbeitsgruppe des UN-Sicherheitsrates fest, die zudem zahlreiche weitere gravierende Verstöße gegen Kinderrechte anprangerte, wie Ermordungen, Entführungen oder Rekrutierungen als Kindersoldaten.</span></p><p><span>Armut fördert Kinderehen</span></p><p>Für die meisten Mädchen ist es extrem schwierig, einer aufgezwungenen Ehe zu entgehen. Die jetzt 17-jährige Manal war 13, als ihre Familie sie zwang, einen 20 Jahre älteren Mann zu heiraten. Zwar endete auch diese Ehe mit Scheidung. Doch Manal bleiben bittere Erinnerungen. Nach der Heirat habe sie von Tag zu Tag stärker gelitten, erzählt sie der DW. Sie habe das Leben als Ehefrau nicht mehr ertragen können. "Je älter ich werde, desto mehr empfinde ich, wie grausam diese Erfahrung war. Es war eine verlorene Zeit."</p><p>Die Verheiratung Minderjähriger wird oft mit angeblichen Traditionen begründet oder vermeintlich religiös gerechtfertigt. Darüber wird im Jemen wie auch in anderen arabischen Ländern seit Jahrzehnten diskutiert - auch wenn sich Ausmaß und die Hintergründe dieser Praxis regional deutlich unterscheiden. Etliche Länder haben beispielsweise ein Mindestalter vom 18 Jahren für die Braut gesetzlich vorgeschrieben - was nicht heißt, dass das immer eingehalten wird.</p><p>Im Jemen gibt es viele Gründe für die zahlreichen Kinderehen: Zur gesellschaftlichen Tradition kommt die chronische Armut, und die hat der Krieg noch massiv verschlimmert: Rund 24 Millionen Jemeniten sind auf humanitäre Hilfe angewiesen. Bildungsprogramme, die darauf abzielten, Kinderheiraten zu unterbinden, wurden zusammengestrichen oder fielen ganz weg. Einem UN-Bericht zufolge stieg die Zahl der Ehen von Mädchen unter 18 Jahren allein zwischen 2017 und 2018 um nahezu das Dreifache.</p><p><span>Niemand schützt die Opfer</span></p><p>Genaue Statistiken gibt es nicht. Aber auch Ahmed Al-Qurashi, Präsident der Kinderschutzorganisation Siyaj, betont im im DW-Gespräch, die Zahl der Ehen junger Frauen sei seit 2014 - dem Beginn des Krieges - in beispielloser Weise gestiegen.</p><p>Die Gründe seien vielfältig, so Al-Qurashi. So fehle etwa eine Instanz, die Kinderrechte durchsetze. In den meisten Regionen des Landes erfüllten Gerichte, Staatsanwälte und Polizei ihre Aufgaben nicht mehr. Dies gelte insbesondere für die ländlichen Gebiete, in denen Kinderehen häufiger vorkämen. Hohe Armuts- und Arbeitslosenquoten, ausfallende Gehälter, der Rückzug zahlreicher Unternehmen und Institutionen sowie ein hohes Maß an Korruption im Umfeld humanitärer Hilfe trügen dazu bei, dass Mädchen früh verheiratet würden. "Mit großer Sorge beobachten wir Verstöße und Praktiken, die gegen die Kinderrechte verstoßen. Da es keinen Opferschutz gibt, nimmt das stark zu." – von Safia Mahdi</p><p><span><a href="https://www.dw.com/de/kinderehe-mädchen-im-jemen-zwangsweise-verheiratet/a-53374960?maca=de-rss-de-top-1016-rdf">https://www.dw.com/de/kinderehe-mädchen-im-jemen-zwangsweise-verheiratet/a-53374960?maca=de-rss-de-top-1016-rdf</a></span></p><p><span>and English version:</span></p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong>War in Yemen forces more girls into child marriage</strong></p><p><span>An extraordinary case of child marriage in Yemen has highlighted the rising number of forced, underage weddings. </span>In rare instances, women have managed to fight back</p><p>Debate over child marriage is not new in Yemen, or the broader region. But on top of social tradition, the conflict in Yemen has exacerbated conditions that have seen a rapid rise in the practice.</p><p>Underage marriages are often justified by claims to tradition or supposed religious reasons. In recent years, some countries in the region have been backsliding after previously passing strong legal measures against them.</p><p>Yemen's chronic poverty, compounded by the war, has led to a worsening of the situation. Around 24 million Yemenis are dependent on humanitarian aid and educational programs aimed at preventing child marriages have been postponed or dropped altogether.</p><p>In 2017 the UN's Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that 52% of Yemeni girls and women had gotten married before the age of 18.</p><p>Between 2017 and the next year, the OCHA reported <span><a href="https://www.unocha.org/story/being-girl-yemen-jehan-and-hamamah%E2%80%99s-story">a threefold increase</a></span> in under-18 marriages. In the face of increasing poverty, parents either can't afford to care for the children or believe a husband's family can offer better protection, the United Nations Children's Fund reported.</p><p>A systemic failure</p><p>Accurate statistics are difficult to collect amid the conflict. But Ahmed al-Qurashi, president of Yemen's Seyaj Child Protection Organization, confirmed the increase in child marriages since the war began, citing a breakdown in governance as a major cause.</p><p>Yemen has no central authority that enforces children's rights. Courts, prosecutors and police no longer carry out their duties in most regions of the country, particularly in rural areas where child marriage is more common, Qurashi said.</p><p>High rates of poverty, a lack of opportunities, falling salaries and a high level of corruption in humanitarian aid circles also contribute to the problem, he said.</p><p>"It is with great concern that we observe violations and practices that violate children's rights," Qurashi said. "The lack of protection for victims makes it all the more serious."</p><p>Women suffer disproportionately from such circumstances, with traumatic consequences.</p><p>Most girls married at a young age find it extremely difficult to escape their husbands. But Manal, who was forced to marry a man 20 years older than her when she was just 13, managed to get a divorce.</p><p>Yemeni psychologist Balqees Abu Lahum stressed the consequences such marriages can have for the young brides forced to have children.</p><p>Many are so young that they don't live through the birth, while those who do survive suffer psychological problems which they pass on to their children, Abu Lahum said.</p><p>Most important in addressing the situation is girls' access to education, she said, as well as further efforts to raise awareness in society.</p><p>Above all, however, it is essential to set a minimum legal age for marriage, Abu Lahum said. But with the country divided and the war entering its sixth year, Yemen still lacks a functioning government that could pass and implement such a law – by Safia Mahdi</p><p><span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/child-marriage-on-the-rise-in-yemen/a-53390598">https://www.dw.com/en/child-marriage-on-the-rise-in-yemen/a-53390598</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B E P)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen Economic Bulletin: Lebanon’s Financial Collapse Traps Yemeni Banks’ Money</strong></p><p>During the ongoing conflict in Yemen, Lebanon emerged a vital clearinghouse to finance imports into the war-torn country. However, as Lebanon experiences its own slow-motion financial collapse today, the Yemeni economy, already in dire straits, is being placed under further strain.</p><p>Long before Dubai entered the scene, Lebanon was the region’s banking hub and Yemeni businesses have long used Beirut banks to store and transfer funds.</p><p>Lebanon’s importance as a financial center for Yemeni businesses and banks grew in 2015 after the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body tasked with combatting global money laundering and terrorism financing, elevated Yemen’s <span><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/#other-monitored-jurisdictions">risk designation</a></span> to ‘high’.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9948#en1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span> </p><p>The 2015 FATF designation led several banks in Western Europe and Canada to close correspondent accounts for Yemeni banks, and to end their relationships with major Yemeni businesses. While banks around the world sought to shed the risk of money tied to Yemen, Lebanese banks – most notably Bank of Beirut – remained willing to serve as a middleman, financing international trade to Yemen – in exchange, of course, for a sizable commission. </p><p>Several Yemeni banks had correspondent accounts in Lebanon’s banking system before the war, and the number has increased over the course of the conflict.</p><p>As of October 2019, Yemeni banks had the equivalent of US$240 million in foreign currency deposited in Lebanon, representing about 20 percent of total foreign currency deposits abroad at that time.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9948#en2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span> </p><p>No Money, More Problems </p><p>Yemeni banks’ exposure to Lebanon’s financial sector became clear in late October 2019 when popular protests against the deteriorating economic situation in Lebanon exposed the country’s financial house of cards. This collapse was the culmination of a number of factors</p><p>Amid simultaneous political, debt, currency and banking crises, Lebanese banks introduced soft capital controls in November 2019, severely limiting withdrawals and banning transfers abroad.</p><p>The inability of Yemeni banks to access their foreign currency holdings in Lebanon has diminished their essential role in facilitating the import of basic commodities into the country, a dangerous development given Yemen’s reliance on imports and the already dire humanitarian situation. The subsequent loss of confidence in Yemeni banks and traders whose money was suddenly, effectively frozen had immediate repercussions for shipments that were already in process and has cast doubt on future trade deals. Exporters withheld planned exports to Yemen until previous unpaid debts were honored. Roughly 30 Yemeni traders have had the experience of a Lebanese bank refusing to facilitate a transfer payment, a senior Yemeni banking official told the Sana’a Center on the condition of anonymity. Deals that had been secure or close to being secured were suddenly up in the air. </p><p>Yemen’s Battle to Maintain Imports During War</p><p>Although some Yemeni banks have been more affected than others, developments in Lebanon represent yet another obstacle for the Yemeni banking system, importers and the country as a whole. While the majority of Yemenis do not use the formal banking system, critically Yemeni banks’ main clients are traders, specifically importers. In a country that imports up to 90 percent of its essential food commodities, everyone suffers from resultant shipment delays and price increases.</p><p>As the CBY struggled to maintain the value of the Yemeni rial and supply foreign currency, remittances took on an added importance in terms of facilitating imports. A number of Yemeni importers began to tap into informal financial networks, including the extensive hawala networks that bind Yemeni nationals in regional countries, specifically Saudi Arabia, to beneficiaries in Yemen.</p><p>The inability to access foreign currency deposited in Lebanon impacts Yemeni banks’ ability to facilitate the purchase of essential commodities that directly contribute to alleviating the humanitarian situation and famine in the country. This is a scandal – and one that should interest donor countries and institutions that gave some $3.6 billion to the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan in 2019. </p><p>Any missed and delayed payments for imports as a result of the Lebanese banking crisis – in particular Bank of Beirut’s liquidity issues and unwillingness to unlock funds – also constitute a longer-term threat to the international reputation of Yemeni banks and businesses. </p><p>Meanwhile, with Lebanon no longer an option, Yemeni banks must at the same time explore alternative destinations for correspondent accounts. Likely alternatives include the United Arab Emirates and Turkey – by Ryan Bailey and Anthony Biswell</p><p><span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9948">https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9948</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>The Presidential Protection Brigades: Hadi’s muscle in the south</strong></p><p>Yemen’s five Presidential Protection Brigades (PPB) include thousands of armed forces responsible for protecting President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and key staff and state institutions relevant to the security and functioning of his office. During the ongoing conflict, Hadi has expanded the PPB, making them among the most empowered armed groups within the government camp. They play a critical role defending the president’s interests against the UAE and its armed affiliates in the south.</p><p>The PPB have been at the center of the longstanding feud between the Yemeni government and the UAE in Aden, clashing on numerous occasions with UAE-sponsored Security Belt Forces and other fighters supporting the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC). In the battle for Aden in August 2019, PPB forces were pushed out of the interim capital and have subsequently become a key point of contention between government and STC mediators during the implementation of the Riyadh Agreement, which seeks to create a power-sharing government centered on the two groups.</p><p>Forces belonging to the PPB are drawn in large part from President Hadi’s home governorate of Abyan and effectively managed by his son, Nasser Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Their loyalty to the president – more on a personal basis, rather than to the office he holds – has made the brigades a prime concern for Hadi’s opponents in the south. STC-aligned forces have sought to weaken the PPB and <span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/657">prevent</a></span> them from being based in or even close to Aden. </p><p>A page from the Saleh playbook</p><p>The PPB was formed in 2012, as part of Hadi’s effort throughout the post-2011 transitional period to weaken his predecessor’s stranglehold on the country’s military and security bodies. A key target of these efforts was the Republican Guard, which Saleh empowered as his own private army. The Republican Guard was led by Saleh’s son Ahmed Ali, with Saleh’s nephew Tareq commanding the largest brigade within the Republican Guard, the 3rd Brigade. In April 2012, soon after Hadi was sworn in, Tareq was dismissed from his position. Tareq now commands anti-Houthi forces on the Red Sea coast, but he has relied on UAE support and does not recognize Hadi’s legitimacy. </p><p>After the Houthis and Saleh took over Sana’a throughout 2014 and 2015 and Hadi fled to Aden, many of the PPB forces remained in Sana’a. With Saudi funds, Hadi’s son Nasser supervised the re-formation and expansion of the PPB, in many cases directly nominating the commanders of different brigades. The PPB are technically under the Ministry of Defense but are not part of Yemen’s seven military regions, and their command structure leads more directly to the president himself.</p><p>There are currently five distinct brigades within the PPB, each with its own headquarters and commander.</p><p>The Five Presidential Protection Brigades </p><p>Most PPB forces have been based in Aden during the conflict, with the exception of the 2nd and 5th brigades. Following the battle over Aden between the government and UAE-backed forces in August 2019, the PPB forces in the interim capital were forced out, and were mostly based in neighboring Abyan while negotiations over the implementation of the Riyadh Agreement continued. T</p><p>A personalized army</p><p>The PPB forces in Aden have been a key target of the UAE-backed separatists not only due to their empowerment, but because of their loyalty to the president. Many PPB commanders and a large portion of the troops are from Abyan and Aden, except for the 5th PPB in Taiz, and are personally loyal to Hadi. This is a key concern not only in negotiations over the implementation of the Riyadh Agreement, but more broadly because it brings into question the sustainability of these forces in any future transfer of power.</p><p>While this degree of personalization can be expected from a unit directly serving and protecting the president, such as the 1st PPB traditionally based in the Presidential Palace, the PPB also have thousands of fighters whose activities go far beyond protecting Hadi. Due in large part to the feud between Hadi and the UAE over control of the south, the PPB have become the best equipped and financed among the government’s forces, and this empowerment has come at the expense of regular military brigades.</p><p>The official role of Nasser Hadi, the president’s son, within the PPB remains unclear, including to PPB personnel themselves. However, Nasser is frequently described as overseeing the forces and he has the ability to dictate orders to brigade commanders directly, working as his father’s top proxy, according to a military source in Aden.</p><p>The next president of Yemen, however he or she comes to power, will not only have to dismantle the final remains of Saleh’s Republican Guard, now in the hands of Tareq Saleh, but also the thousands of PPB fighters from Abyan and surrounding areas loyal to Hadi and his son.</p><p><span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/771">https://al-masdaronline.net/national/771</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Coronavirus und Seuchen / Most important: Cornonavirus and epidemics</span></h2><p><span>Siehe / Look at cp1, cp4</span></p><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span><span>Awareness campaign for the prevention of coronavirus</span></p><p>Amal Foundation for the poor and orphan care and Humanitarian work has carried out an awareness and education campaign entitled "Your health is my health, we must educate you and you must protect yourself" at the Nursing Home in the interim capital Aden</p><p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp4sgdcTRTY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp4sgdcTRTY</a></span></p><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p>[Hadi] Govt holds rebels responsible for coronavirus in their respective regions of control</p><p>Yemen’s government held rebels in the north and the south responsible for the transmission of coronavirus each in their respective regions of control.</p><p><span><a href="http://en.26sepnews.net/2020/05/11/govt-holds-rebels-responsible-for-coronavirus-in-their-respective-regions-of-control/">http://en.26sepnews.net/2020/05/11/govt-holds-rebels-responsible-for-coronavirus-in-their-respective-regions-of-control/</a></span></p><p>My comment: „held rebels in the north and the south responsible for the transmission of coronavirus”: This is BS.</p><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p><span>56 people died in Yemen's </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Aden?src=hashtag_click">#Aden</a></span><span> on Monday.

Fewer than 1,000 have been tested for COVID-19. An emergency room doctor explains how he treats patients for the novel coronavirus without the tools and equipment to make diagnoses — or protect himself.</p><p>As of May 11, only 803 coronavirus tests have been conducted countrywide, a World Health Organization spokesperson told The World. Yemen, the Arab nation located to the south of Saudi Arabia, has a population of nearly 30 million people.</p><p>With test kits so scarce, doctors in a warzone are flying blind. They don’t know for sure whether patients have the virus, even though hospitals are already seeing patients with COVID-19 symptoms. </p><p>“Most of them complain of fever, dry cough,” said Dr. Nader al-Durafi, an emergency room doctor at al-Saber hospital in Aden. “Some of them have difficulty breathing.” </p><p>The nation’s health system — broken by more than five years of war — <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52493609">will likely be tested</a></span> over the coming months. </p><p>“Yemen has a very small problem, in the sense of the number of cases that have been reported,” said Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's health emergencies program, <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=3259601064090194&amp;ref=watch_permalink">in a May 6 press conference.</a></span> “But we believe that the virus is spreading at the community level, and we need to focus on providing essential health services — and COVID-19 services — to all people in Yemen.”</p><p>Durafi says diagnosing COVID-19 is no simple matter in Yemen. </p><p>“There are two other epidemics here in Aden: Dengue fever and Chikungunya,” he says. Both of those illnesses are marked by high fevers — just like COVID-19. </p><p>“Most of the people here are suffering from a fever these days. And with the lack of test kits, we can't determine who has COVID-19 and who hasn't.”</p><p>In April, the International Initiative on COVID-19, a consortium of humanitarian groups, said it was sending a shipment that contained <span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-yemen/companies-give-yemen-tens-of-thousands-of-coronavirus-test-kits-to-ease-shortage-idUSKCN22332S">tens of thousands of test kits</a></span>.

That's because people are careless. There's thinking that the virus is not coming through Yemen.” </p><p>And without tests, Durafi says, there is no way to be sure: “We'll never know the actual number of the infected people.” </p><p>Durafi says he assumes that he is being exposed to the coronavirus, and takes precautions to protect himself and his family. </p><p>“Bringing home the virus — that is my major fear, especially [as] we live in an apartment with my father who has a history of heart disease,” he says. “What we do for protection: the masks, the eyeglasses, the full uniform, I mean. I keep sanitizing my hands every five minutes, keep a safe distance while examining the patients.

In order to show even the lowest possible level and merit of leadership and credibility toward their own people and the international community, both treasuries should be the first to finance such a fund and not wait for international grants that might take time to be disbursed. Public revenues from collected taxes and tariffs should be redirected toward financing the emergency fund. International and — most importantly — regional stakeholders have the moral obligation to support such a fund.</p><p>In the case of a lockdown, one must reckon with a sharp decrease in people’s disposable incomes. Along with the severe impact on livelihoods, food prices would significantly increase due to disruptions in market supply chains</p><p>The Yemeni rial is projected to experience another <span><a href="https://www.calpnetwork.org/publication/statement-on-likely-impacts-of-covid-19-on-humanitarian-cash-transfers-in-yemen/">wave of devaluation</a></span> due to decreasing remittances. Yemenis abroad, especially in neighboring Saudi Arabia, also face lockdowns that prevent them from working or sending cash back home across the border. These factors combined with a loss of government revenue from crude oil exports hit by falling global oil prices mean the Yemeni government’s fiscal deficit is <span><a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2020/04/16/Catastrophe-Containment-And-Relief-Trust-Approval-Of-Grant-Assistance-For-Debt-Service-Relief-49330">projected</a></span> to increase by <span><a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=37&amp;pr.y=14&amp;sy=2017&amp;ey=2021&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=474&amp;s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPPC%2CPCPIPCH&amp;grp=0&amp;a=">1.3 percent</a></span> of GDP in 2020.</p><p>Given there is less room for implementing a monetary policy response at the moment, the focus should be on implementing short-term fiscal policies that will mitigate the impact of a lockdown. The emergency fund should provide cash assistance to people engaged in precarious labor and be used in part to increase medical facilities’ capacities. </p><p>Yemen’s working poor, who constitute a large share of the still-employed population after five years of war, should not be abandoned during the fight against COVID-19. A cash assistance program for the duration of a lockdown targeting those who lose their livelihoods would be a lifeline for informal and irregular workers, and small business owners.</p><p>In big cities such as Sana’a, Aden, Marib and Taiz — where roughly 6 million to 7 million people reside — it would be appropriate to implement a rent-freeze for the duration of the lockdown. Families allocating a larger share of their dwindling income to food purchases can be expected to come up short on rent money at the end of the month.</p><p>A severe economic crisis will have immense humanitarian repercussions on the country’s working population, cutting what for many Yemenis is their final lifeline. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the policy response is not politicized by the different warring parties and remains directed toward mitigating the devastating impact of COVID-19 on lives and livelihoods.

The coalition has not been able and is not even close to achieving the goal it set for itself at the start of the intervention, namely to reinstate the regime of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi in Sanaa with effective control of most of the country. Beyond that, cracks have appeared and widened in the Saudi-backed coalition over the past years</p><p>The independence of the south and the formation of a state, backed by the UAE, would not pose as much of a threat as the consolidation of the Houthi-Iranian dominance. That, however, does not mean the Saudis are willing to let Yemen be divided and see the UAE exercise its influence on a newly created state located in a strategic position and in the area Saudi Arabia considers to be of its own influence. The kingdom will likely continue to oppose the creation of an independent southern Yemen, with the question being how much leverage the STC truly has and whether it can realistically expect to maintain independence—or whether this is more of a bargaining tactic vis-a-vis Saudi Arabia.</p><p><span><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/middle-east-watch/saudi-arabias-effort-wind-down-its-intervention-yemen-faces-significant">https://nationalinterest.org/blog/middle-east-watch/saudi-arabias-effort-wind-down-its-intervention-yemen-faces-significant</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>Saudi-Arabien will Geberkonferenz für zerstörten Jemen ausrichten</span></p><p><span>Saudi-Arabien, das mit Verbündeten seit fünf Jahren Ziele im benachbarten Jemen bombardiert, will eine Geberkonferenz für das vom Bürgerkrieg geplagte Land ausrichten.

The project aimed to address the WASH, Health and food security needs of the most vulnerable and conflict affected communities living in the targeted areas. The key results of the project were: (1) increased capacity for vulnerable and conflict affected households, especially women, to meet livelihoods and basic needs; (2) improved access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene services for vulnerable households in conflict affected areas; (3) increased equitable access to Sexual Reproductive Health and Right (SRHR) services for targeted communities.</p><p>With the objective of comparing the result of the key performance indicator of the project with the established benchmark information during the baseline period, an end-line survey was conducted in March 2020 in the project operational districts. A quantitative methodology (i.e. household survey) was utilized to collect pertinent data. The following are the key survey outcomes:</p><p>FOOD CONSUMPTION SCORE: The average FCS for the surveyed households is 43.64. The survey results further indicated that 66.3% of HHs are in acceptable food consumption whereas 26.2% and 7.5% of HHs respectively are in borderline and poor food consumption.</p><p>REDUCED COPING STRATEGY INDEX (rCSI): The rCSI score for the surveyed households is 12.75.</p><p>HOUSEHOLD HUNGER SCALE: 92.5% of HHs faced little or no hunger; 7.5% of HHs faced moderate hunger; and 0% of HHs faced severe hunger.</p><p>PRIMARY SOURCE OF WATER: 64.5% of respondents replied that their primary source of water is piped system at homes whereas 22.4% of them are getting water from protected boreholes, Piped System in public fountain is the primary source of water for 7% of interviewees and 6.1% of survey participants use unprotected water harvesting pools. Overall, the endline survey result indicated that 93.9% of interviewees primarily relay on protected water sources.</p><p>ACCESS TO WATER SOURCES: 14.6% and 6.1% of interviewees respectively replied that it takes ‘1-2 hours’ and ‘more than 2 hours’ to fetch water from the nearest water source whereas 8.2% of them stated that it takes 30 to 60 minutes to fetch water. 6.4% of respondents reiterated that it takes less than 30 minutes to fetch water from the nearest water source, 64.5% of respondents (Female: 54.3%, Male: 71.2%) replied that their water source is piped systems at the house so that they do not travel anywhere to fetch water.</p><p>WATER TREATMENT: 74.3% of interviewees indicated that they use Chlorine/other chemical reagents to treat drinking water whereas 1.9% practice boiling to treat water before drinking. 23.8% of survey participants reiterated that they did not practice any water treatment technique.</p><p>SANITARY PRACTICES: 82.2% of survey participants indicated that they use family toilets for defecation whereas 9.4% of them mentioned that they use public toilets. The remaining 8.4% of them practice open defecation.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/end-line-survey-report-meeting-basic-needs-livelihood-enhancing-access-wash-and">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/end-line-survey-report-meeting-basic-needs-livelihood-enhancing-access-wash-and</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Stranded Yemenis in India ask government for repatriation: ‘We don’t have money for rent’</p><p>Yemeni citizens stranded in India have appealed to the Yemeni government to repatriate them back home.

To save lives, UNFPA is calling for urgent funding of $59 million to provide lifesaving reproductive healthcare and women's protection services until the end of 2020. An additional $24 million is needed for the COVID-19 response to protect health workers and women and girls accessing reproductive health services in the conflict-affected country.</p><p>"If lifesaving reproductive health services are stopped it will have catastrophic consequences for women and girls in Yemen - placing them at even greater risk," said Dr. Natalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director. "Yemen urgently needs funding to keep health facilities open to protect the health and safety of women and girls."</p><p>As it stands now, nearly half of all health facilities in Yemen are not functioning or only partially functioning. Only 20 percent of health facilities provide maternal and child health services due to staff shortages, lack of supplies, inability to meet operational costs, or damage due to the conflict. Equipment and medical supplies are inadequate or obsolete. Health workers have not been paid, or have only been irregularly paid, in more than two years.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/urgent-funding-needed-protect-health-and-safety-women-and-girls-yemen-amidst-covid-19">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/urgent-funding-needed-protect-health-and-safety-women-and-girls-yemen-amidst-covid-19</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>WFP Yemen Situation Report #03, March 2020</p><p>Highlights</p><p>WFP provided general food assistance to 12.8 million Yemeni people so far under the March distributions.</p><p>WFP has activated an alternate work arrangement in all offices as a precautionary measure against Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</p><p>WFP requires USD 535 million to continue operations unimpeded over the next six months (May 2020 – October 2020).</p><p>In Numbers</p><p>24.1 million people in need of humanitarian assistance*</p><p>3.65 million people internally displaced</p><p>20.1 million people are food insecure</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/wfp-yemen-situation-report-03-march-2020">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/wfp-yemen-situation-report-03-march-2020</a></span></p><p>(B H)</p><p>Yemen: Access Constraints as of 7 May 2020</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-access-constraints-7-may-2020">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-access-constraints-7-may-2020</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp4 Flüchtlinge / Refugees</span></h2><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>IOM Yemen: COVID-19 Response Update, 19 April - 02 May 2020</p><p>IOM is deeply concerned about the rise in anti-migrant sentiment following this announcement. Migrants were already vulnerable at each stage of their journey through Yemen, being at risk of stigmatization and human rights abuses and lacking access to basic services. These vulnerabilities have been further exacerbated by COVID-19, with migrants being scapegoated as carriers of the disease since the very early stages of the global outbreak. Migrants are facing increased risks to their protection and human rights, as thousands have found themselves stranded and a rising number of them face crowded conditions in transit and detention centres, as well as forced quarantine in circumstances not aligned with public health measures.</p><p>IOM is contributing to the coordinated effort to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 by ensuring continuity of essential humanitarian services and scaling up COVID-19 response efforts with a focus on displaced and migrant populations. Ensuring unimpeded humanitarian access to facilitate effective COVID-19 programming remains a challenge in northern governorates where the operational environment continues to be restrictive. In the south, insecurity, bureaucratic impediments and challenges around competing leadership also have an impact on activities.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-covid-19-response-update-19-april-02-may-2020">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-covid-19-response-update-19-april-02-may-2020</a></span></p><p><span>and it’s not just the Houthis as is claimed here: </span><span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/772">https://al-masdaronline.net/national/772</a></span></p><p>(* B H)</p><p>IOM Yemen Quarterly Update: Quarter 1, January - March 2020</p><p>According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), between January and March 2020 approximately 28,000 migrants arrived in Yemen; down from the 37,000 who made the same journey in quarter 1 2019 and a decrease of nearly 50 per cent when comparing March 2020 with March 2019. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic was a key factor influencing migration patterns, as security was heightened at borders. Additionally, forced quarantine of migrants in facilities not aligned with public health measures is also reported to be taking place and migrants are being stigmatized by local media who are labelling them as carriers of diseases.</p><p>IOM and humanitarian organizations continued to face severe access constraints, primarily in the north of the country. The humanitarian space, already restrictive in 2019, continued to shrink, as obstructive policies and directives from the authorities rose. On average, 92 per cent of IOM permits from its head office in Sana’a were not approved in the first quarter of the year. This meant that IOM was not able to carry out critical assistance as well as assessment and monitoring activities, in support over 150,000 beneficiaries.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-quarterly-update-quarter-1-january-march-2020">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/iom-yemen-quarterly-update-quarter-1-january-march-2020</a></span></p><p><span>(* A H)</span></p><p>1.400 afrikanische Migranten verlassen das Quarantänezentrum in Al-Dschouf</p><p><span>1.400 afrikanische Migranten verließen das Quarantänezentrum in der Stadt Al-Hazm in der Al-Dschou Provinz, um sich auf ihre Deportation in ihre Länder durch den Hafen von Al-Hodeidah vorzubereiten.</span></p><p><span>Eine Quelle der örtlichen Behörde in Al-Dschouf sagte, dass die örtliche Behörde in Zusammenarbeit mit den Sicherheitsdiensten mehr als zweitausend illegale afrikanische Einwanderer beschlagnahmt habe, die vom saudischen Regime von Nadschran in der Al-Dschouf Provinz deportiert worden seien.</span></p><p><span>Die Quelle wies darauf hin, dass die Einwanderer im Quarantänezentrum in der Stadt Al-Hazm Quarantäneverfahren und deren Abreise in Chargen und unter Aufsicht der Sicherheitsdienste zur Vorbereitung ihrer Deportation durch den Hafen von Hodeidah unterzogen wurden.</span></p><p><span>Die Quelle wies darauf hin, dass sich noch etwa 500 afrikanische Migranten im Al-Hazm-Quarantänezentrum befinden und in den kommenden Tagen zurückgeführt werden.</span></p><p><span>Die lokalen Behörden und Sicherheitsdienste ihre Kampagnen zur Verhaftung afrikanischer Migranten aus Saudi-Arabien im Rahmen von Vorsichtsmaßnahmen zur Bekämpfung des Corona-Virus intensiviert haben.", die Quelle betonte.</span></p><p><span>Die Quelle verurteilte die fortgesetzte Deportation afrikanischer Migranten durch das saudische Regime in die Provinz in einer Weise, die den islamischen und menschlichen Werten widerspricht, um das jemenitische Volk zu schädigen und das Corona-Virus zu verbreiten</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.saba.ye/de/news3096537.htm">https://www.saba.ye/de/news3096537.htm</a></span></p><p><span>(* A H P)</span></p><p>1,400 African Migrants Leave Overwhelmed Quarantine Center in Al-Jawf</p><p>1,400 African migrants left the quarantine center in Al-Hazm city of al-Jawf province, in preparation to deport them to their countries through Hodeidah port. </p><p>An official in the local authority in al-Jawf said that the local authority, in cooperation with security services, seized more than 2,000 illegal African immigrants, who had been deported by the Saudi regime from Najran to al-Jawf province.

There is absolutely no evidence that one group of people is more responsible for its transmission than another. There are, however, groups of people who are more vulnerable as a result of having pre-existing medical conditions and/or limited access to care, especially in emergency settings. It is our collective duty to prioritize and protect these groups. This is a global pandemic, and the only way to fight it is do so together. No one is safe until everyone is safe,” said Dr Ahmed Al Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean.</p><p>“Migrants should not be stigmatized or associated with the risk of importing diseases. It is conditions on the route from Africa to the Arabian Gulf, including barriers to health services, poor living and working conditions and exploitation, which pose serious health risks. We must join together to address these risks and stop stigmatization,” said Carmela Godeau, IOM Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.</p><p>WHO, IOM and partners have ensured the inclusion of migrants in the public health response led by the Yemeni authorities, with the support of the humanitarian community — an important step towards non-discrimination that needs to be
