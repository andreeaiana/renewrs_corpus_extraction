This is the case of Yemen, a country experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.</p><p>Western countries have not wanted to put an end this barbarism. While their leaders express ‘concern’ about the Yemen crisis and even call for the war to end, they continue to supply the weapons and technology the Saudi Coalition needs to carry out its crimes more effectively. The reason is very simple: Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil exporter and is therefore our ally.</p><p>Furthermore, public opinion in western countries has been quite incapable of applying the necessary pressure to cut our ties with the Saudis, even when the latest successor to Al Qaeda (ISIS) declared a new caliphate in June 2014 and directly threatened our security by committing terrorist attacks in western countries. The deaths of hundreds of Europeans have not been enough to raise questions about our Middle East policy.</p><p>Yemen may seem a distant and remote country to ordinary citizens, but it is not so remote for our leaders. Since 2001, Yemen was one of the countries where the Bush administration chose to launch his war on terror (so successful that is ended up creating the ISIS monster) and Yemen duly suffered US terrorism head on (the drone campaign) with the civilian population bearing the brunt, as always. More than a decade later, as western guardians continued to ensure our safety by killing innocent civilians, our Saudi and Persian Gulf allies carried on destroying this country, with the terrible consequence that jihadism was able to take full advantage of the chaos and misery war had left behind</p><p>However, for our media and politicians it is much more important to focus on fuelling sensationalized debates around the Coronavirus crisis in Spain. The Coronavirus crisis in countries like Yemen does not merit any attention, regardless of the fact that “the United Nations <span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/10119">estimates</a></span> that 16 million Yemenis may ultimately <span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/10119">be infected</a></span> with the COVID-19 virus” in a country without sufficient capacity to face the onset of such a profound crisis, where the majority of the population, cornered between hunger and disease, has already endured a brutal cholera epidemic in the first years of the war that affected one million people.</p><p>In a perfect world, media speaking truth to power, should denounce our “democratic representatives”, as responsible for having provided the weapons that have destroyed what was already the poorest country in the region.</p><p>The responsibility of western countries for the crisis that is Yemen is clear. You don’t need to be very radical to realize that economic interests have taken priority over the suffering of the Yemeni people. </p><p>Crowning shame</p><p>Is it possible that the western powers, which have filled their pockets with the deaths of so many innocent people, are unable to provide the massive aid now required to curb the worst humanitarian crisis in the world?</p><p>Isn’t it a crowning shame for our democracies that the country that is leading the initiatives to raise funds to ease the humanitarian crisis in Yemen is none other than Saudi Arabia? Obviously, their intention is to whitewash their own image. Saudi Arabia’s representative to the United Nations, Abdallah Al-Mouallimi, said a few days ago that the “Kingdom and the UN will continue to support Yemen”. Of course, this humanitarian aid is insufficient, due to the continuous cutbacks in the funds destined for the country.</p><p>But finally, let us return to the role played by the media. The exhausting effort of NGOs and independent organizations to bring out the truth, is little rewarded by the poor media attention they receive. This has terrible consequences. People are not aware of the crimes that our leaders help to perpetrate and therefore governments have more margin to carry out actions against the majority interest of the country’s citizens. It is vital that people know what is going on. In Spain, there is a scandalous information blackout, which must be addressed if our government is not to have a free path to aiding and abetting the terrible suffering of the Yemenis –by Isa Ferrero</p><p><span><a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/can-europe-make-it/yemens-war-and-the-blackout-in-the-spanish-press/">https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/can-europe-make-it/yemens-war-and-the-blackout-in-the-spanish-press/</a></span></p><p><span>My comment: it's not just Spain it's ALL western countries.</span></p><p><strong>(** B H K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Wikipedia: Blockade of Yemen</strong></p><p>The blockade of Yemen refers to a sea, land and air <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade">blockade</a></span> on <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen">Yemen</a></span> which started with the positioning of <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">Saudi Arabian</a></span> <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship">warships</a></span> in Yemeni waters in 2015 with the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen">Saudi invasion of Yemen.</a></span> The <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a></span> had joined the blockade in October 2016.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen#cite_note-:2-1">[1]</a></sup> In November 2017, after a Houthi missile heading towards <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Khalid_International_Airport">King Khalid International Airport</a></span> was intercepted,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> the Saudi-led military coalition stated it would close all sea land and air ports to Yemen,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> but shortly began reopening them after criticism from the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a></span> (UN) and over 20 aid groups.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> The <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade">blockade</a></span> of Yemen has resulted in widespread starvation, to the extent that the United Nations has raised concerns about the possibility of it becoming the deadliest famine in decades.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen#cite_note-5">[5]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> The <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization">World Health Organization</a></span> announced that the number of suspected persons with <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera">cholera</a></span> in Yemen reached approximately 500,000 people.</p><p>As a result of the blockade there is a desperate shortage of necessary supplies such as food, water and medical supplies, to the extent that children are at risk of disease due to lack of drinkable water.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup></p><p>A limited number of aid ships can unload, and the bulk of commercial shipping, on which the desperately poor country depends, is being blocked, creating a state of emergency for Yemenis.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen#cite_note-Farsi-14">[14]</a></sup> In spite of entreaties, Saudi Arabia has failed to pay out any of the $274 million it promised to invest into humanitarian relief</p><p><span>United States's role</span></p><p>Although U.S. President <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a></span> asked Saudi Arabia to allow humanitarian aid to enter Yemen in 2017,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen#cite_note-17">[17]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen#cite_note-tasnimnews-18">[18]</a></sup> the U.S has also supported the Arab coalition's intervention in the war and its blockade on Yemen since March 2015.

Socotra is sometimes compared to the famous Galapagos islands in the Pacific. The plants and animals on the World Heritage Site are found nowhere else on earth. Now they are in a war zone. The Southern Transitional Council in southern Yemen has deposed the island's governor and declared self rule. The fighters are backed by the United Arab Emirates. Yemen's internationally-recognised government supported by Saudi Arabia calls the takeover a 'coup'. So what makes the island so valuable to Yemen's warring sides?

Despite its size, Socotra has the potential to become one of the most important places in the area.</p><p>The Dubai Ports World (DP World) has established a number of ports along the Red Sea and has identified Socotra for its future business expansion, hence the recent charm offensive. With a <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DP_World">portfolio of 78 operational marine and inland terminals</a></span> supported by more than 50 related businesses in 40 countries across six continents, the presence of DP World in Socotra could seal it for the UAE, making it one of the most powerful nations in the world.</p><p>In parallel to those ambitions, the UAE has been amassing arms and building a powerful arsenal which continues to fuel the conflict in Yemen, especially in the south.</p><p>This military presence and the support of separatists in Socotra has increased its political instability. It also continues to prevent the island from benefiting from its tourism potential as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p><p>Although Socotra has remained part of Yemen, the central government has done little to improve the lives of the people on the island. There is widespread poverty and economic underdevelopment. The UAE has thus been luring Socotra with promises of economic benefits in return for naval facilities. Socotra’s rare flora and fauna and clear waters are at risk if such plans go ahead. Any unfettered increase in human and cargo traffic could be devastating for the environment.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200623-socotra-could-become-one-of-yemens-environmental-and-cultural-tragedies/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200623-socotra-could-become-one-of-yemens-environmental-and-cultural-tragedies/</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>An old Emirati document indicating the early interest of "Abu Dhabi" in Socotra Island, dating back more than twenty years ago</strong></p><p>An old Emirati document shows the early interest of the Abu Dhabi authorities in the strategic Yemeni island of Socotra, which was dominated by the so-called Southern Transitional Council supported by the Emirates.

That’s five times the global average.</p><p>With the health system in collapse, we know many cases and deaths are going unrecorded. Burial prices in some areas have increased by seven times compared to a few months ago.</p><p>COVID-19 is adding one more layer of misery upon many others. As the Prime Minister of Yemen said earlier in the month, a macabre humanitarian tragedy is imminent.</p><p>I will brief you today on five priority issues: protection of civilians, humanitarian access, funding, the economy and progress towards peace.</p><p>First, protection of civilians – a requirement under international humanitarian law.</p><p>In May, an average of five civilians were killed or injured every day. One in three of them was a child. Two-thirds of incidents that harmed civilians occurred in family homes or farms, and five incidents struck health facilities.</p><p>We also continue to see appalling multiple-casualty incidents. On 15 June, strikes hit a car in a rural area of Sa’ada, killing at least 13 civilians – including four children.</p><p>My second point is about humanitarian access. Again, a requirement of international humanitarian law.</p><p>Safe transport for aid workers into and out of Yemen is a core component of humanitarian access. Air passenger service to Aden resumed several weeks ago on a reduced schedule, but the first inbound staff flight to Sana’a did not land until 15 June. Incoming staff are self-quarantining for 14 days.</p><p>We are no closer to accessing the SAFER oil tanker.</p><p>My third point is about funding for the aid operation.</p><p>On 2 June, as I mentioned earlier, the United Nations and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia co-hosted a virtual pledging event for Yemen. Thirty-one donors pledged $1.35 billion for humanitarian aid, including about $700 million in new funds.</p><p>That’s only about half of what was pledged last year. It is also far below what we need to keep programmes going. Reduced pledges from the Gulf region account for essentially all of the reduction.</p><p>What is the impact of that? Incentive payments for health workers who are not being paid have already ceased for 10,000 of them. Those people are working on the front lines responding to COVID-19. Water and sanitation programmes that serve 4 million people will start closing in several weeks. About 5 million children will go without routine vaccinations, and by August, we will close down malnutrition programmes. The wider health programme, which 19 million people that benefit from will stop too.</p><p>Many of the pledges that were made have still not been paid. We see no reasonable cause to further delay disbursement of pledges. As I told the conference, promises don’t save lives. It is only when you implement what you promised, you save a child.</p><p>My fourth point is about Yemen’s economy, which is heading for an unprecedented calamity.</p><p>No commercial fuel vessels have entered Hudaydah since 8 June due to a political dispute over revenue management which Martin alluded to. Fuel is essential to pump water, power sanitation networks and keep heath centres running. So the parties must urgently work with Martin’s team to find a sustainable solution.</p><p>Larger economic problems are also brewing. The Yemeni rial is again depreciating rapidly, trading at around 620 rial to the dollar in the north and 750 rial in the south. With nearly all goods imported, this means more Yemenis are being squeezed out of markets, unable to buy food or other life-saving requirements.</p><p>We have never before seen in Yemen a situation where such a severe acute domestic economic crisis overlaps with a sharp drop in remittances and major cuts to donor support for humanitarian aid – and this of course is all happening in the middle of a devastating pandemic.</p><p>At a minimum, we can expect many more people to starve to death and to succumb to COVID-19 and to die of cholera and to watch their children die because they are not immunized for killer diseases. So I call urgently on all Yemen’s donors to provide predictable foreign exchange injections to avoid total economic collapse. This must be in addition to humanitarian funding, which I again urge donors to disburse immediately and to consider increasing.</p><p>Humanitarian agencies can still, with adequate funding, keep the humanitarian situation stable. That’s what we all want to do. That will also help with the political process.</p><p>So, my last point, there is a stark choice before the world today: support the humanitarian response in Yemen and help to create the space for a sustainable political solution.</p><p>Or watch Yemen fall off the cliff.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-mark-28">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-mark-28</a></span></p><p>and a summary. <span><a href="https://www.unocha.org/story/un-humanitarian-chief-yemen-will-%E2%80%98fall-cliff%E2%80%99-without-adequate-support-humanitarian-and-covid">https://www.unocha.org/story/un-humanitarian-chief-yemen-will-%E2%80%98fall-cliff%E2%80%99-without-adequate-support-humanitarian-and-covid</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong>Autonomous Efforts for Education in Rural Yemen During War: The Village of Mariya</strong></p><p>The overall situation in the country has driven many parents to dismiss their children’s education; parents need their children’s extra help in providing for the family under an extremely difficult economic situation. All of this has contributed to a loss of faith in basic education among this generation of students in Yemen, who believe more in the utility of informal labor rather than the pursuit of education. How can they see the point in education when they see their educated parents unable to put food on the table anymore? Consequently, the number of basic education student dropouts has drastically increased during the war years.</p><p>Just like many other civil servants in Yemen, public school teachers have not received their salaries for over three years. For this reason, most schools offer only three classes a day, since many teachers have become unavailable. Due to the lack of adequate numbers of teachers, schools have resorted to reducing the number of classrooms and putting as many students as possible from the same grade in one overcrowded classroom. This has affected the quality of education, for it is impossible for a teacher to be able to cater to the different needs of students when there are over 100 students per classroom.</p><p>Parents who can still just about afford private education, with a lot of difficulty, have transferred their children from public to private schools. This has also led to overcrowded private schools and affected the quality of education private schools offer, leading to both public and private schools being at their worst levels of performance for the past few years.</p><p>Life and education conditions in Yemen have always varied between rural and urban areas. Even before the war, the invasion of qat plants in villages made young students prefer growing qat to pursuing education. During the war, the loss of faith in the utility of education increased, leading to a significant increase in dropouts, with only 20 per cent of students graduating high school.</p><p>Early marriage is one of the main reasons students drop out of schools in rural Yemen. In some cases, girls in villages are married off at the age of 13 or 14, or younger in rare cases, with cases of early marriage increasing the most during high school.</p><p>As for boys, the number one reason to drop out of school is to grow qat, because they believe it offers a more stable future than education and public sector employment. Early marriage is also another challenge that boys face, for it is difficult for a 15-year-old who gets married to pursue education when he is expected to provide for his new family. In this case, dropping out of school to grow and sell qat is the alternative. In addition, some parents do not support their children regarding education, and in some cases, they even encourage them to drop out.</p><p>Generally, the decision to drop out of school remains a choice for rural boys, but girls are forced to leave school in most cases, especially as some fathers believe that basic literacy would suffice for girls who are needed for domestic and agricultural labor.</p><p>As the war and lack of salaries drags on, challenges facing the education sector in rural Yemen multiply. Some schools have closed in some villages. Most rural students ended up dropping out, except for those who are holding on to their education despite the difficulties, and commute to neighboring villages daily to go to school – or end up moving to cities in the quest for education.</p><p>In many Yemeni villages, the culture of tribal compensation was of great help in this regard. Tribal compensation is a financial amount that one tribe pays to another when reconciliation is offered after a dispute. This culture of collective autonomous community problem solving makes it easy for people in villages to take the initiative to find solutions for issues such as the absence of state spending on education and teachers’ salaries.</p><p>Mariya, a village 15 km to the west of Dhamar city in Yemen, provides an example of collective autonomous efforts to save education. After meeting and consulting with each other, the people of Mariya collected money from the families of school children and donations from those who are doing well financially to cover salaries for existing teachers in the village’s school. They also contract additional teachers to cover high school level scientific subjects. Teacher Saleh Baghasha and the parents association at the school led the initiative to meet with parents and people of the village. Baghasha says, “We used all possible events and arguments to convince the people of the village to support education. We went to weddings, funerals and Friday sermons to speak about the issue.” – by Bachir Zendal</p><p><span><a href="https://almadaniyamag.com/2019/11/30/education-yemen-mariya/">https://almadaniyamag.com/2019/11/30/education-yemen-mariya/</a></span></p><p>Film: <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUUtZSAykdE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUUtZSAykdE</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p><p><strong>Five lives forever changed by Yemen’s war</strong></p><p>Below, five Yemenis explain what the past five years have meant for them and their families.</p><p><em>Nawal, a midwife from Hodeidah</em> <em>(displaced in Lahj)</em></p><p>When Nawal was a teenager, she witnessed her mother struggle through a difficult labour. This was when she knew she wanted to be a midwife. Nawal finished school and enrolled at university. A few years later she was working as a midwife in a hospital in Hodeidah. </p><p>“I love my work so much. I feel so happy when I hold a baby in my hands,” she says.</p><p>But then the war started. Nawal’s hometown, Hodeidah, has experienced some of the fiercest fighting in Yemen’s five-year war. In 2018, the conflict forced Nawal and her family to flee.</p><p>“We sold my father’s motorbike,” she explains. </p><p>“We thought we would end up living on the street. We did not know where to go. We came to Aden. Thanks to God, we met a woman on the bus who told us about this camp for internally displaced people. We arrived after midnight. Thankfully, we received mattresses and blankets and we started to feel comfortable.”</p><p>Nawal and her parents, two brothers and baby daughter were registered with WFP to receive monthly cash assistance for food and other basic needs. This money has also allowed Nawal to return to doing what she loves: helping women give birth.</p><p>There is nearly always a woman outside Nawal’s tent asking for assistance. She has helped deliver countless babies in the camp, earning her the moniker ‘Dr. Nawal’.</p><p>“I feel embarrassed to ask for money, especially if the family is very poor. After I finish my work, I do not ask for a penny,” says Nawal. “In Hodeidah, I used to make money from my work. But here they are all displaced. They live in difficult situations and cannot afford to pay me. Because I am a woman, I know how women suffer during childbirth. That’s where my passion came from to help women when they give birth. I walk with them (during labour). I wash their faces with water. When a woman is tired, I help her lie on the mattress. I give her dates for energy. I massage her belly. Women love me and I love this job.</p><p><em>Ahmed, a cobbler from Taiz (displaced in Ibb)</em></p><p>Ahmed is a cobbler from Taiz, Yemen. He is now displaced in Ibb and dependent on WFP monthly food assistance to feed his six children.</p><p>“I dream of a home for me and my children. I also want a job. I want to work and support my family. I used to make leather sandals and sell them to people for 200 to 300 riyals [ 53 to 80 USD],” explains Ahmed. </p><p>Ahmed’s family was poor but he had enough to feed his children. When the war started, an air strike destroyed his home in Taiz. He moved his family multiple times before arriving in Ibb, seeking shelter in a disused building that had become a home for many displaced families.</p><p>“I can’t find any work here,” says Ahmed. “Sometimes my children work in the streets collecting empty bottles. I dream of a home for me and my children. I also want a job. I want to work and support my family.”</p><p><em>Rania, a teacher from Hodeidah (displaced in Lahj)</em></p><p>Rania always knew she was going to be a teacher.</p><p>“When I was a child, if anyone in my class was having a problem or couldn’t understand something, they would ask me. At break time, I would always end up re-explaining the maths or science exercises to my classmates,” she explains.</p><p>“When we were first displaced, we remembered our old life with sadness.”</p><p>Rania and her eldest daughter, Amani, stand in the entrance to their home in a camp for internally displaced people in Lahj, Yemen. Photo: WFP/Mohammed Awadh</p><p>Rania worked in a local school in Hodeidah, her hometown. She loved her job. But then one day the tanks rolled into the school playground. Her classroom was transformed overnight into a military barrack. She realized it was time to leave.</p><p>Rania and her five children fled south and sought refuge in a camp for internally displaced people in Lahj, where they receive monthly cash assistance from WFP.</p><p>“When we were first displaced, we remembered our old life with sadness,” says Rania.</p><p>But she did not forget her passion for teaching, quickly finding new purpose to her life in the camp.</p><p>“I noticed that all the displaced children had too much free time,” she explains. “They were quarrelling all the time and creating problems for their families. So, I started teaching them. In the morning it was reading and writing, and in the afternoon I started sessions for memorizing the Holy Qur’an.”</p><p>Rania’s students often tell her stories of what happened to them during the war — horrifying tales of violence and forced recruitment.</p><p>“The war has influenced and damaged so many children psychologically. What I am trying to do is ensure safety for my children and other children here in this camp. I want our children to be educated. I want them to pursue their ambitions no matter what conditions we live in. I want my daughter to be a doctor and my son to be a police officer, because our children are the forces of change in Yemen.” (photos)</p><p><span><a href="https://yemenhumanitarianresponse.exposure.co/five-lives-forever-changed-by-yemens-war">https://yemenhumanitarianresponse.exposure.co/five-lives-forever-changed-by-yemens-war</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Coronavirus und Seuchen / Most important: Coronavirus and epidemics</span></h2><p>(B H)</p><p>Yemen weddings air on live TV to avoid coronavirus shutdown</p><p>Yemeni couples have turned to TV so their families and friends can join in on wedding celebrations despite the coronavirus shutdown.</p><p>The <span><a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2020/6/19/yemen-in-focus-saudi-led-coalition-continues-to-kill-children">Yemeni</a></span> grooms sit expectantly inside a TV studio, waiting for their wedding parties to be broadcast live so that families and friends can join in the celebrations despite a <span><a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/6/19/yemen-coronavirus-infections-beyond-1-million-uk-study-suggests">coronavirus</a></span> lockdown.</p><p>The pandemic has forced weddings to be scaled down or cancelled across the world but in the <span><a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/6/23/yemen-cracks-down-on-emirati-charities-for-undermining-stability">Yemeni</a></span> capital <span><a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/6/23/blaze-rips-through-sanaa-residential-area">Sanaa</a></span> the traditional folk music and dancing have been beamed into people's homes instead.</p><p>Well-wishers call into the satellite channel <em>Alhawyah</em> to offer their congratulations to the grooms, dressed in their finest clothes and with rifles propped up next to them and traditional daggers tucked into their belts. </p><p>As the number of coronavirus cases began to rise in war-ravaged Yemen, <em>Alhawyah</em> - Arabic for "identity" - began hosting wedding parties with the aim of reducing guest numbers and preventing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Participants are sprayed with disinfectant before entering the studio for the all-male gatherings, where a popular band performs.</p><p><span><a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/6/24/yemen-weddings-air-on-live-tv-amid-coronavirus-shutdown">https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/6/24/yemen-weddings-air-on-live-tv-amid-coronavirus-shutdown</a></span></p><p>(* B H)</p><p><span>Coronavirus threatens war-torn Yemen amid humanitarian catastrophe</span></p><p>The coronavirus pandemic is threatening to ravage Yemen as a humanitarian catastrophe grips the country.

Now that it has, the impact is already showing.</p><p>Laila Abdulrab has a front-line seat. A humanitarian aid worker, she has worked for the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, since 2011. Despite the mass graves being dug in Yemen's major cities as probable COVID-19 cases increase rapidly, she has continued working, aiding some of Yemen's most vulnerable.</p><p>"I saw and sensed the fear and anxiety [of the refugees and internally displaced people] because of the pandemic and its impact on them and their community," Abdulrab told Al Jazeera after her last field visit.</p><p>"The demand for UNHCR assistance is greater, and without it, many vulnerable people, including single-women households, unaccompanied children, sexual violence survivors and others, will become at serious risk of eviction and a lack of access to food and basic needs."</p><p>"Many Yemenis have lost their livelihoods as a result of the pandemic, and the most vulnerable groups in society, such as IDPs and refugees, have become more vulnerable," Abdulrab said. "The already fragile health system is overburdened and lacks the capacity to keep up with the coronavirus situation."</p><p>The UN has warned that the death toll from the coronavirus in Yemen could surpass the combined death toll of war, disease, and hunger in Yemen over the last five years - a number estimated at <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/06/issues-desperate-plea-financial-aid-war-ravaged-yemen-200612175307651.html">more than 100,000 people</a></span>.</p><p>The question of funding will perhaps have the biggest effect on humanitarian work in Yemen over the coming months.</p><p>"We are not speaking about months, we are speaking about weeks," Jean-Nicolas Beuze, UNHCR representative in Yemen, told Al Jazeera. "We are going to have to drastically reduce the number of beneficiaries for programmes such as emergency shelters.</p><p>"We are going to have to cut 20,000 families from that funding, that means that these people will live in the open, subject to the elements," said Beuze. "In these conditions, how can they protect themselves from the coronavirus? They cannot."</p><p>Beuze also said the UNHCR would have to cut its cash assistance programme and many of its partnerships with local Yemeni NGOs, leaving 1,500 Yemeni staff without jobs.</p><p>International bodies, including the World Food Programme, have <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/houthis-stole-food-mouths-hungry-yemenis-181231143128776.html">accused the parties to Yemen's conflict</a><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/houthis-stole-food-mouths-hungry-yemenis-181231143128776.html"> of stealing aid money</a></span>, in particular the Houthis.

They speak the language, are familiar with the traditions, and recognize the prevailing mindset. Zamzam Saleh Saed Jaeem, the Deputy Communications manager in YRC’s Dhamar Branch, said, “There were rumors that made some people flinch when they saw us wearing masks, as if we were sick and contagious! But we stood our ground and persevered in identifying for them the wrong practices and correcting their misinformation, so they ended up helping us to put up the posters!”.</p><p>In Yemen, a country affected by war for over five years, the YRCS has been one of the few humanitarian organizations to freely continue executing its activities and missions all over the country doing what they most excel at: humanitarian support for communities affected by conflict and natural disasters, medical services especially for women and children, nutrition aids, prevention campaigns to tackle the risks of diseases as cholera and malaria, and lately, societal awareness through field campaigns around the country’s 22 governorates to stave off the dangers of COVID-19. These campaigns are implemented by the Heads of Communications in the YRC’s Branches, accompanied by the ambulance drivers and 44 volunteers, through posters and by playing recorded messages with preventive measures.</p><p>**Nisrine Ahmed **explained how the messages are being delivered via portable loudspeakers on ambulances that roam the districts and neighbourhoods of secluded areas within each governorate. “We are distributing in 10 communities the flyers and posters consisting of crucial info about COVID-19, its transmission, and the ways to prevent it”.</p><p>The YRC focuses on 440 areas across Yemen but does not go door-to-door. The awareness messages are broadcasted on loudspeakers and disseminated by posters. Only when faced with specific inquires, the Heads of Communications in the YRC’s Branches explain the content about COVID-19 face-to-face.</p><p>“While they need the bare necessities for a normal life, it’s hard to ask people to stay home and stick to the recommended safety measures to prevent COVID-19”, said Jaeem adding, “people don’t have money to buy a mask or gloves to use when they go outside. We encountered a tuned-out society when we first started. We were met with obstacles to persuade the population and change their ideas about the virus. We raised the level of awareness among people and helped them.

In an interview with DW, the writer and activist says the media and the UN have failed her country.</p><p>Yemeni novelist and activist Bushra al-Maqtari has continued to speak out despite the threats, intimidation and harassment. She has won several international awards for her writing, but more than anything else she is hailed as a progressive liberal voice in a deeply conservative society where women's literacy, access to health and human rights have been in persistent decline.</p><p>Her book <em>What you left behind? Voices from a forgotten war-torn country</em> is an impassioned raw account of the displaced, widowed and orphaned survivors of Yemen's war and was published in 2018. Focusing on the resilience of victims, she deliberately excluded all political discussion: "It is politics and corruption that made them victims in the first place," she says, keen to empower the victims' voices instead of glorifying the perpetrators of crimes.</p><p>When discussing the international coverage of Yemen's war, al-Maqtari says the media is supposed to hold up a mirror to society but has only paid lip service to different political sides, local and regional entities. "Perhaps, this is what hurts us the most as Yemenis."</p><p>"After we lost all hope in the Yemeni politician and the political elites, our hearts and eyes turned to writers, journalists and media to be our voice to stop the damage caused by failed leaders. A majority of them have turned into a whip in the hands of the politician after we saw them as a lifeline."</p><p>The lack of accurate international media coverage in Yemen has directly contributed to bad international policies at the expense of ordinary civilians in Yemen. This is also true of Syria, Iraq and Libya. Even before the war, al-Maqtari pointed out Yemen's reports lacked depth, humanity, and culture. The country was only seen through the prism of a global security threat — al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.</p><p>When the war started in 2015, she wrote in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>: "The international community must take stock of its responsibility in fostering this crisis." She has repeatedly called out the UN's failings, accusing the organization of pandering to different political sides and not holding them accountable.</p><p>"If you follow them [the UN]," she says, "you will see their actions are no different from the madness of politicians, and in many ways, they have orchestrated all of this — madness and corruption. In this regard, I can propose to the United Nations to change the status of its envoys in Yemen from 'UN envoy' to 'UN failure.'"</p><p>In the <em>Times</em> piece she asked, "Is there any hope left for Yemen?"

The <span><a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/understanding-houthi-faction-yemen">Houthi rise</a></span> over the last five years would not have happened if they had focused on the military domain alone. Their policies have been comprehensive and they have been active at the social, political and ideological levels. All their activities have one target: to consolidate their rule and eliminate any opposition.</p><p>In the areas falling under the Houthis’ control, any decision they make or laws they introduce will be unopposed by the population. The latest <span><a href="http://al-masdaronline.net/national/894">bylaw on "zakat,"</a></span> an obligation (tax) that constitutes one of the five pillars of Islam, is a case in point. A <span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10CgWg4oJZFE5DOrL--YDZCOEx2h0PQCi/view">long document</a></span> has been released, stipulating that citizens should pay "khums," a 20% tax on economic activities and natural resources including oil, gas and fishing industry. The document, which was signed by Houthi President Mahdi al-Mashat in late April, states that khums should be distributed in six ways:</p><p>Share of kinsmen of the Prophet: This share is allocated to the Hashemites. </p><p>Share of the orphans: This share is distributed to orphans, including the Hashemite orphans.</p><p>Share of the needy: This share is meant for those in need, including the Hashemites.</p><p>Wayfarer share: This is meant for travelers — Hashemites or other Muslims — who find themselves with no money in a region other than their own and can't return home.</p><p>The Houthis have based their new bylaw on a verse from the Quran, which they interpreted to benefit their own. The verse states, “And know that whatever spoils you take as booty of war, a fifth thereof is for Allah, and for the Messenger and for the kinsmen (in need) and orphans and the poor and the needy traveler.” (Surah Al-Anfal [8:41])</p><p>Shamsan Abu Nashtan, head of the Zakat General Authority, told Al-Masirah newspaper June 9 that the <span><a href="http://www.almasirah.net/post/158986/%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%88-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85-99%D9%85-%D9%88%D9%87%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%83-%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%B7-%D9%83%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%A6%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B7%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7">bylaw is not new</a></span> and was first issued in 1999. “We have not changed anything in it,” he said. “Raising this matter … comes in the context of targeting the Zakat General Authority and its activities that have contributed to mitigating poverty that has been caused by the aggression and the blockade,” referring to the five years of airstrikes and blockade on Yemen by the Saudi-led Arab coalition.</p><p>While the Houthis contend this bylaw is in conformity with the Yemeni law and Sharia, opposing voices have said such an illegal move is racist and it legalizes discrimination among Yemenis. Such a bylaw would give the Hashemites the right to collect money from citizens on the basis of family origin, a matter many believe contradicts the Yemeni Constitution that states all people are equal in rights and obligations. Officials in the United Nations-recognized government have described this Houthi bylaw as “unconstitutional.”</p><p>Political observers see the Houthi bylaw as a reflection of their ideology, or what the Houthis say is their divine right to the ruling. Nabil al-Bokairi, a Yemeni researcher focusing on politics, told Al-Monitor, “We should not be surprised to see the Houthis introduce such a law. This law legalizes a racial idea that they already possess. The bylaw makes it clear that there [is a difference between] Bani Hashim [Hashemite] and other Yemenis, and both have different rights.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/06/yemen-houthis-law-tax-hashemite-discrimination.html">https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/06/yemen-houthis-law-tax-hashemite-discrimination.html</a></span></p><p>(B K P)</p><p>Houthi militia turns summer centers into child recruitment camps</p><p>From the Iran mullahs’ regime, the Houthi militia was inspired by the idea of recruiting children, when the mullah used children as fuel for his wars and attracted terrorist organizations to become tools to kill and threaten international peace and security.</p><p>With a severe shortage of elements on the front lines, the Houthi militia in Sana’a sent some of its elements to schools to bring young children to the front lines.

          Yuval Harari ist einer der erfolgreichsten Sachbuchautoren der Welt. Von der „Kurzen Geschichte der Menschheit“ wurden in Deutschland über eine Millionen Exemplare verkauft. Nun erscheint der Weltbestseller als Graphic Novel: Harari noch zugänglicher und unterhaltsamer, aber genauso intelligent und lehrreich - ein Muss nicht nur für seine Fans.
