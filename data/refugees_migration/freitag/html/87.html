An extremely significant outcome of the meeting was the decision to establish a new entity in the region – the Arab and African Coastal States of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden (AARSGA) – to coordinate and cooperate on political, economic, security, cultural and environmental issues.</p> <p>Concerns among the aforesaid countries bordering the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden regarding piracy and maritime security is nothing new. There have been several meetings in the past among these countries to discuss the common security challenges facing the region. But the latest Saudi initiative to establish a new entity in order to bring together the countries of the region into a regional framework of cooperation is distinctly new. At the end of the meeting, the then Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al Jubeir stated that this initiative “is part of the kingdom’s efforts to protect its interests and those of its neighbours.…and to create synergies between the various countries” and added that “the more cooperation and coordination that you have among the countries of this region, the less negative outside influence will be on this region.”1 The meeting and Jubeir’s statement are also reflective of the emergent security and strategic concerns of Saudi Arabia in the region.</p> <p><span>In this backdrop, the recent Saudi initiative is an effort to build bridges across the Red Sea with its western neighbourhood as it faces compounding challenges in the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi military operations in Yemen against the Houthi rebels have not yielded desired results. Rather, it has faced global criticism as it has been accused of causing civilian deaths and the ensuing humanitarian crisis in the country. The cracks within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) that began with the diplomatic boycott of Qatar in June 2017 also continue to widen. The unity of the GCC, the regional organisation where Saudi Arabia once played the most dominant role, is now under severe stress. Further, Qatar has been strengthening ties with Iran and Turkey – two major regional challengers of Riyadh.</span></p> <p><span>The regional geopolitics is getting redefined post the Qatar crisis: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Egypt and Jordan on one side, and Qatar, Turkey and Iran on the other. Thus, with the GCC as an organisation divided, Qatar swiftly moving closer to Iran and Turkey, and the Houthis fighting stubbornly in Yemen, Saudi Arabia is looking westward to establish a new regional arrangement.</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://idsa.in/idsacomments/new-saudi-initiative-of-arab-and-african-pkpradhan-150119">https://idsa.in/idsacomments/new-saudi-initiative-of-arab-and-african-pkpradhan-150119</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="http://www.eurasiareview.com/16012019-new-saudi-initiative-of-arab-and-african-coastal-states-of-the-red-sea-and-the-gulf-of-aden-analysis/">http://www.eurasiareview.com/16012019-new-saudi-initiative-of-arab-and-african-coastal-states-of-the-red-sea-and-the-gulf-of-aden-analysis/</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment: Simply: Saudi Arabia seeks for a new body to strengthen its influence on its neighbors. – Striking here: The author generally takes the Saudi foreign policy propaganda stories for granted.</span></p> <p><span>Comment: </span>Extermination explained: 'the continuing presence of Houthis in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/yemen?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCty6RueBJKnxzHad_t29PtLyXFa3IMu2QXn3Q93qsyIw21c8dR14lcBs4VXVhFzc94nmM_IvnCi7bUxod-IdY0rO41stkOMC8aIHGu2QadCs01MJey1kEPCYKJSKXasV1__V442zR9bTp78e7xRtmJunNhDq7kQW97XM_eyI9EYPEZ-PSzDhGfP_lipDO-b-Ss27UMZHjtnV51QkSOJp48EXm9qr8JwHgQUaZVxbsc3o0N7XWpGZmfh2zEQ_aNkg-loj2sYUUKzqqH9HlKIOc2zuceaXNWGjGaDUqjpsr3rJJtvU8zOSG-039NHhjAQ9EZvhjcClnwcjNybzPQB1YnsoNP&amp;__tn__=%2ANK-R"><span>#Yemen</span></a> close to the waters of the Red Sea is an obvious security threat for Saudi Arabia'</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SaudiArabia.war.crimes.against.Yemen/posts/1963888190573832">https://www.facebook.com/SaudiArabia.war.crimes.against.Yemen/posts/1963888190573832</a></span></p> <p><span>My comment to comment: Which Yemeni party will be present “</span>close to the waters of the Red Sea” is up to the Yemenis and not to the Saudis or any other foreign force.

She has worked relentlessly to earn Saudi women the right to drive.</p> <p>Saud al-Qahtani, a top royal adviser, was present several times when Loujain was tortured, she said.

Weeks later, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Qahtani for his role.</p> <p>But six sources told Reuters that Qahtani remains active on behalf of the royal court. Two of them said he has kept in touch with the crown prince while three others said he has continued to instruct a small group of Saudi journalists on what to write about the kingdom’s policies.</p> <p>As head of the royal court’s media centre until his dismissal, Qahtani ran an electronic media army tasked with protecting Saudi Arabia’s image, dictating the official line on issues from a dispute with Qatar to security and human rights.</p> <p>The apparent impunity of Qahtani, seen as the crown prince’s right-hand man, risks undermining Saudi promises to hold those responsible to account, the sources say. The U.S. Senate last month backed a resolution blaming the crown prince, known as MbS, for the killing and insisted Riyadh fully investigate.</p> <p>A Saudi official denied Qahtani was still playing a role inside the royal court, saying he has not conducted any work since his dismissal and that he remains under investigation and banned from travel.</p> <p>At the heart of the crown prince’s inner circle, Qahtani controlled access to MbS and would often speak on his behalf before he was dismissed, government insiders have said.</p> <p>No official replacement has yet been announced.</p> <p>Qahtani has continued to make repeated appearances at the royal court, although it was not clear in what capacity, five of the sources said. All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters.</p> <p>“He is still around, free and in favour. The crown prince is still holding on to him and doesn’t seem to be willing to sacrifice him,” one of the foreign sources said.</p> <p>MbS himself has told visitors that Qahtani is still an advisor while assuring them that some responsibilities have been taken from him, according to a source familiar with the discussion between the crown prince and the visitors. The source did not elaborate.</p> <p>Qahtani has also continued to dictate the royal court’s official line to columnists and top editors he considers able to influence public opinion, according to three of the sources, despite leaving a WhatsApp group he ran for that purpose.</p> <p>Saudi activists living abroad still see his influence on Saudi media and in the Twitter attacks they say they face, accusing them of being disloyal to MbS or unpatriotic for not supporting his policies.</p> <p>“Nothing has changed. It seems to have the same line, the same offensive language. His fingerprints are all over it still,” said Hala al-Dosari, a Saudi scholar and activist based in the United States.</p> <p><span><a href="https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1P91ZE">https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1P91ZE</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/saudi-aide-fired-over-khashoggi-murder-still-wields-influence-140544">http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/saudi-aide-fired-over-khashoggi-murder-still-wields-influence-140544</a></span></p> <p>(A P)</p> <p>MBS acknowledges need to hold Khashoggi killers accountable</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/mbs-acknowledges-need-to-hold-khashoggis-killers-accountable201901141946210001/">https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/mbs-acknowledges-need-to-hold-khashoggis-killers-accountable201901141946210001/</a></span></p> <p>My comment: Joke of the day.</p> <p>(A P)</p> <p>Israeli hacking firm accused of tracking Khashoggi does not deny selling software to Saudi</p> <p>'There was no use on Khashoggi, including listening, monitoring, tracking, collecting info with any product or technology of NSO,' said a founder of the Israeli cyber-intel company</p> <p>A founder of the Israeli cyber-intel company, the NSO, denied that his firm’s tracking technology was used to monitor slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, however, he also refused to either confirm or deny sale of the software to Riyadh, the Times of Israel reported.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/israeli-hacking-firm-accused-of-tracking-khashoggi-refuses-to-deny-selling-software-to-saudi-3471720">https://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/israeli-hacking-firm-accused-of-tracking-khashoggi-refuses-to-deny-selling-software-to-saudi-3471720</a></span></p> <p>My comment: Where does he know this from? This presumably is a lie.</p> <p>(* B P)</p> <p>Only reform in Saudi can lead to Khashoggi justice</p> <p>Having now passed 100 days since the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi by a Saudi hit squad in that country’s consulate in Istanbul, the question remains; will there ever be justice for Jamal Khashoggi?</p> <p>Here it is important to be clear that when we talk about justice, we are not talking about only one thing. Legally, justice would mean that Jamal’s killers would be arrested, charged, tried, and sentenced according to the evidence of their guilt. Politically, however, justice for Jamal has far broader connotations.</p> <p>Both definitions of justice in this case seem difficult to achieve.</p> <p>The killing was a crime committed in Turkey, and subject to Turkish jurisdiction; despite the popular misconception that diplomatic missions constitute foreign soil. The suspects in this crime are now in Saudi Arabia, and some have reportedly been arrested by Saudi authorities.</p> <p>Strictly speaking, legal justice for Jamal Khashoggi would mean the extradition to Turkey of all suspects in his killing, where they would be tried and sentenced according to the available evidence. This appears unlikely to happen.</p> <p>The issue of political justice for Jamal Khashoggi is far more difficult to quantify; but the general feeling is that it should involve severe consequences for Saudi Arabia. The scope of these consequences runs from public condemnation to suspension of trade ties; to economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation; to the forced removal of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from the government and his prosecution for murder.</p> <p>Again, the plausibility of almost any of these options is very low.</p> <p>Add to this that there is also a conflict between the desire for political justice and legal justice insofar as there is very little incentive to fight for Turkey’s right to try the suspects in the Khashoggi killing, as Turkey itself has been engaged in a severe crackdown on dissidents and journalists for several years.</p> <p>What we are left with then, is a smouldering sense of unfairness; an anger that powerful autocrats can get away with murder because of their money and strategic alliances. And this is precisely what Jamal Khashoggi felt. These feelings are exactly what inspired him to call for democracy and to speak out against the Saudi regime. By murdering him, the Saudi government has exponentially amplified his criticisms and made the world pay attention.</p> <p>Ultimately, justice for Jamal Khashoggi will not be achieved through the trial of his killers (wherever that may take place), nor through symbolic punitive actions in response to his murder – <em>By Radha Stirling</em></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/stirling-och-partners/pressreleases/only-reform-in-saudi-can-lead-to-khashoggi-justice-2823518">https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/stirling-och-partners/pressreleases/only-reform-in-saudi-can-lead-to-khashoggi-justice-2823518</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp8b Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun</span></h2> <p><span>Siehe / Look at cp8</span></p> <p><span>Mona Eltahawy: </span>Because I helped Rahaf, this “news” clip from MBC - 1st Arabic-language 24hr satellite channel (believed to have close ties to <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Saudi?src=hash">#Saudi</a></span> royals) - says “Mona Eltahawy is a feminist extremist who hates men and wants women to have sex in the streets.”</p> <p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/monaeltahawy/status/1085292223409860609">https://twitter.com/monaeltahawy/status/1085292223409860609</a></span></p> <p>referring to <span><a href="https://twitter.com/ibro1411/status/1085288856616869899/video/1">https://twitter.com/ibro1411/status/1085288856616869899/video/1</a></span><span> (removed)</span></p> <p>I have clearly made it.

It was then leaked to other news outlets. Among Arkin's criticisms of his former employer and other mainstream media outlets: that by incessantly covering the presidency of Donald Trump, the network is being held hostage by Trump; that in its reflexively anti-Trump coverage, it has become even more pro-military; that NBC and MSNBC are now captives of the security state.</p> <p>" Like all three US 24-hour news channels, MSNBC hires ex-military and intelligence figures, many of them now employed by the defence and security industries. The networks call them 'analysts', which is misleading because many of them are advocates. According to Arkin, the preponderance of those voices and how much airtime they are given on stories such as Trump's recent decision to pull out of the Syrian conflict, are evidence that US news networks have become captives of the security state. In his early days on television, many commentators "were from the academic world," explains Arkin. "There were others who were activists. Now, all we hear are retired generals and admirals and high-level government officials ... And all we hear is a kind of partisan analysis of how bad Trump is because he's breaking with past administration policy or whatever. The American public suffers." Cenk Uygur, creator and host of The Young Turks, says "The corporate media is massively pro-war. So when you combine those two forces of being against Donald Trump and pro-war when he announces withdrawal they hate it and they fight him with a passion that you haven't seen in a long time." MSNBC can live with the criticism and just point to the ratings, which show a clear appetite for anti-Trump TV. Viewers clearly don't mind the pro-war bias and happily take in political talking points from former Trump officials who have left the administration. <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-wpp93TKY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-wpp93TKY</a></span></p> <p><span>(* A P)</span></p> <p>I heard from Rep Ro Khanna's office today that Ro is introducing the Yemen War Powers Act this week &amp; hopefully will be voted on in Feb, but it's up in the air due to the shutdown so stay tuned.

The filings in the case are public and easy to access.</p> <p>The essence of the lawsuit, heard by D.C. Superior Court Judge Robert Rigsby, is a claim by Saudi dissident Ali Al-Ahmed of the Gulf Institute think tank here in Washington, D.C., of defamation against the Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee, or SAPRAC. Al-Ahmed accuses the leader of SAPRAC, Salman Al-Ansari, of calling him a terrorist in publically available writings of the Saudi lobbying group.</p> <p>SAPRAC seems to have lost the initial, legal wrangling in the case the court documents show. A judge recently ruled that calling someone a terrorist is not an opinion, it is a factual statement, and therefore can become defamatory.

At a time when our infrastructure is crumbling, when public schools lack the resources to provide a quality education for our kids, when <span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/4/7/15225800/30-million-americans-are-still-uninsured-inequality">30 million people have no health insurance</a></span>, there were very few Democrats opposed to Republican efforts to increase military spending by $165 billion over two years.</p> <p>Democrats, for good reason, vehemently oppose almost everything Trump proposes, but when he asks for a huge increase in military spending, there are almost no voices in dissent. Why is that? </p> <p>Here's a truth that you don't often hear about in the newspapers, on television or in the halls of Congress. But it’s a truth we must face. Far too often, American intervention and the use of American military power have produced unintended consequences that have caused incalculable harm.</p> <p>Unfortunately, today we still have examples of the United States supporting policies that I believe will come back to haunt us. One is the ongoing <span><a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/21513/saudi-arabia-united-states-war-yemen-jamal-khashoggi">Saudi war in Yemen</a></span>.</p> <p>That is reason enough to end U.S. military support for what Saudi Arabia is doing in the civil war in Yemen.</p> <p>But the second reason is even more important.

It details relationships that range from private donations for scholarship funds for Saudi students to research sponsorships by state-owned institutions, ultimately recommending that the university should not sever any ties with the country.</p> <p>All major governments, businesses, and organizations are imperfect in some way or another, but there are very few modern entities that MIT actively engages with that are more abhorrent than the Saudi government. Collaborating with the Saudi government sends the signal to the rest of the world that the university is willing to work with a regime that is actively involved in killing and suppressing millions — that it shares common goals and values with an entity that has consistently demonstrated hatred towards women, LGBTQ individuals, and religious minorities.</p> <p>Thus, we call on MIT to 1) form an independent committee with students and non-administrative faculty members to deeply assess each relationship on a case-by-case basis, 2) cut ties with the Saudi government as well as all Saudi organizations that are closely associated with the government, and 3) release a statement directly condemning the human rights violations of the Saudi Arabian government.</p> <p><span><a href="https://thetech.com/2019/01/14/mit-cut-ties-saudi-arabia">https://thetech.com/2019/01/14/mit-cut-ties-saudi-arabia</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Yemen conflict: Trump faces bipartisan move to end Saudi support</p> <p>Newly empowered Democrats could force president to use veto to continue unpopular war</p> <p>Congress is expected to make an unprecedented challenge to Donald Trump’s authority to take the US into a war in the coming weeks, with a bipartisan measure calling for the end of US military involvement in the <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen">Yemen</a></span> conflict.</p> <p>The Senate <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/13/senate-yemen-saudis-trump-resolution">passed the measure</a></span>, invoking the <span><a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/war-powers.php">1973 War Powers Resolution</a></span>, last month but a parallel effort in the House of Representatives was sunk by the Republican leadership.

Khanna’s resolution in the House. Passage of a resolution by both houses directing the president to end all military support for the Saudi coalition will be a significant blow to executive overreach in matters of war. Congress has abdicated its responsibilities for decades. Reasserting Congress’ constitutional role to end our participation in a truly horrific war is long overdue. Passing these resolutions will tell the Saudis and Emiratis that there is broad opposition in the U.S. to their war, and it will put additional pressure on them to bring that war to an end.</p> <p>As important as cutting off U.S. support for the Saudi coalition is, it is just the first step in preventing Yemen from plunging deeper into famine. </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/congress-can-end-u-s-involvement-in-the-war-on-yemen/">https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/congress-can-end-u-s-involvement-in-the-war-on-yemen/</a> </span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Divided Government, Divided Response to Yemen</p> <p>Will the U.S. finally take concrete action against the Saudis in Yemen?</p> <p>Considering these new allegations against the Saudis, the question arises: will further concrete action against the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen ever come?</p> <p>Democrats in Congress would certainly hope so, having so far supported actions to greater regulate U.S. presence in Yemen. In addition to the Senate resolution, House Democrats attempted a similar move last year.</p> <p>The fate of these two pieces of legislation offers a view of what’s to come for any broader action to regulate the Yemeni Civil War: it’s doomed to fail.

Lindsey Graham (R, SC) <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/cia-senate-khashoggi-.html">directly calling</a></span>him “complicit” in the murder, ultimately they do not support any greater action to reduce the U.S. presence in Yemen than simply condemning the Saudis.</p> <p>House Republicans acted on this sentiment late last year when they <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/republicans-move-stall-house-yemen-181212202356088.html">effectively blocked</a></span> any Yemen-related legislation from being discussed there until the 116th Congress began this month.</p> <p>While Democrats, with their new majority in the House, could now potentially pass legislation there to reduce the U.S. presence in Yemen in response to the illegal use of child soldiers in the conflict and other actions undertaken by the Saudi government, their greater efforts will most likely fail in the Senate. </p> <p>Even if Democrats were to overcome the challenges and push legislation through the Senate that eliminated the involvement of the U.S. in the atrocities of the Yemeni Civil War, they would face their biggest hurdle yet: President Trump.

But he failed to outline a coherent vision, strategy, or policy approach for addressing these problems.</p> <p>I’ve seen several reactions by Arab citizens to Pompeo’s speech: sadness, mockery, and the shrug of indifference. To many, Pompeo confirmed widespread fears that the Trump administration simply lacks seriousness of purpose in the Middle East. The speech strongly resembled the rhetoric of many of the region’s own authoritarian regimes—full of bluster, hyperbolic language, attacks on political rivals, and boasts of the administration’s tremendous policy successes that felt divorced from reality.</p> <p>AMY HAWTHORNE, <a href="https://pomed.org/team/amy-hawthorne/">Deputy Director for Research</a></p> <p>I see three audiences for Pompeo’s remarks:</p> <p>Trump’s evangelical base. </p> <p>Middle East rulers </p> <p>“freedom-loving Iranians,” </p> <p>If there was a conceptual through line in the somewhat disjointed speech, it was: “radical Islamism,” whether of the Sunni or Shia variety—and extending from the Muslim Brotherhood to ISIS to the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran—is the threat to the region and to the United States, what matters most to this administration in the Middle East, and the United States will support Israel and Arab authoritarian leaders to defeat it. </p> <p>ANDREW MILLER, <a href="https://pomed.org/team/andrew-miller/">Deputy Director for Policy</a></p> <p>Pompeo’s speech was not a statement of foreign policy strategy, but rather a rambling screed dominated by distortions, falsehoods, and outright lies.

In defiance of the U.S.’ Mideast track record, Pompeo asserted</p> <p>Fiction meets fact</p> <p>To illustrate Pompeo’s revisionist take on U.S.-Mideast relations, the last time Iran invaded another country was 1798 while the U.S. — since 2001 — has invaded and occupied Iraq, continues to occupy Afghanistan, helped foment the Syrian conflict by arming terrorist groups, supports and arms the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, and helped overthrow the government of Libya.</p> <p>In keeping with his framing of the U.S.’ “innate good” early on in his remarks, Pompeo offered a very selective list of American “successes” in the Middle East, a list that omitted any mention of the U.S. invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan or the U.S.-supported overthrow of Libya</p> <p>Even more troubling than his revisionist take on the U.S.’ recent past in Middle Eastern and North African affairs, Pompeo asserted that U.S. military occupation was a guard against chaos and that the region only suffered when “neglected” by the American military.</p> <p>In other words, the “shame” around the U.S.’ forever wars and history of military intervention — both covert and overt — in the Middle East “is over” in Pompeo’s eyes, providing a “real new beginning” that heralds the return of the U.S. as “liberators” to the Middle East.</p> <p>A basic reality-check</p> <p>Iran, the undeniable target of the apparently soon-to-arrive wave of U.S. interventionism promised in Pompeo’s recent speech, wasted no time in firing back at Pompeo’s assertion that the U.S. is a “force for good” in one of the world’s most geopolitically important regions.</p> <p>Pompeo’s conscious decision to create a parallel history of U.S. intervention in the region with little basis in fact was unlikely done with the intention of fooling listeners into actually believing this account of historical events. Instead, it seems to have been a not-so-subtle means of putting the entire region and world on notice that the U.S. is poised to initiate a new era of military intervention in the Middle East in order to “liberate” nations that continue to resist U.S. influence and regional hegemony – by Whitney Webb</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/mideast-fact-meets-fiction-mike-pompeo-touts-us-goodness-and-threatens-more-of-it/253803/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/mideast-fact-meets-fiction-mike-pompeo-touts-us-goodness-and-threatens-more-of-it/253803/</a></span></p> <p><span>(* A B P)</span></p> <p><span>Donald Trump struggles to be the Middle East’s anti-Obama</span></p> <p>Pompeo’s speech highlights foreign policy parallels the US president prefers to ignore</p> <p>For all those wondering about the Trump doctrine for the Middle East, Mike Pompeo has usefully provided a clue. It came last week in the form of an important foreign policy speech replete with contradictions and sometimes verging on absurdity. If there was any meaningful policy thread it was that US president Donald Trump stands against whatever Barack Obama stood for. The Trump doctrine for the Middle East is, very simply, being anti-Obama.</p> <p>From the start, Mr Trump defined his approach to the Middle East as an anti-Iran campaign, a principle from which every other policy appeared to flow.</p> <p>Mr Pompeo’s speech was a fitting example of Mr Trump’s fixation on Iran.</p> <p>On human rights he referred only to Iran’s ayatollahs and their henchmen who “murdered, jailed and intimidated freedom-loving Iranians”. Of freedom-loving Arabs who are murdered, jailed and intimidated there was no mention.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/541cd8fa-18ae-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21?fbclid=IwAR2fxLowKTUGJxVeg8Sqy9JxNUGUX9pPq5USMQ5hXWsxwEvhdFIP-T3tSrk">https://www.ft.com/content/541cd8fa-18ae-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21?fbclid=IwAR2fxLowKTUGJxVeg8Sqy9JxNUGUX9pPq5USMQ5hXWsxwEvhdFIP-T3tSrk</a> </span></p> <p><span>(* A B P)</span></p> <p>Pompeo's Middle East Speech - A Blustering Promise Of Less U.S. Involvement</p> <p>Today Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, visited Egypt. He held a somewhat delusional speech at the American University in Cairo. It is headlined:</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2019/01/288410.htm">A Force for Good: America Reinvigorated in the Middle East</a></span>:</p> <p>There is little in the speech that supports the headline. It starts with blustering</p> <p>It follows a list of false claims and fake history:</p> <p>For those who fret about the use of American power, remember this: America has always been, and always will be, a liberating force, not an occupying power. We’ve never dreamed of domination in the Middle East.</p> <p>Pompeo ignores the still valid <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Doctrine">Carter doctrine</a></span> which demands exclusive U.S. domination of the Middle East: "An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force."</p> <p>When the mission is over, when the job is complete, America leaves. Today in Iraq, at the government’s invitation, we have approximately 5,000 troops where there were once 166,000. We once had tens of thousands of U.S. military stationed – personnel stationed in Saudi Arabia. Now that number is a tiny fraction.</p> <p>In 2011 the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki <span><a href="http://world.time.com/2011/10/21/iraq-not-obama-called-time-on-the-u-s-troop-presence/">rejected</a></span> to sign a Status of Force agreement that would have given U.S. troops in Iraq special rights. In consequence the U.S. had to retreat from Iraq. </p> <p>The speech goes on with a long passage of bashing Iran and lauding Israel. Pompeo says that the Trump administration wishes to establish the 'Middle East Strategic Alliance', an Arab NATO that allies with Israel. A pipe dream born out of sheer ignorance that is destined to fail.</p> <p>The speech then comes to the core of Trump's thinking and policy:</p> <p>Let me be clear: America will not retreat until the terror fight is over. [...] But as President Trump has said, we’re looking to our partners to do more, and in this effort we will do so going forward together.</p> <p>For our part, airstrikes in the region will continue as targets arise.<br /> And as the fighting continues, we will continue to assist our partners in efforts to guard borders, prosecute terrorists, screen travelers, assist refugees, and more. But “assist” is the key phrase.</p> <p>Those who want to fight Iran down to the last U.S. soldier, i.e. Israel and Saudi Arabia, will not like to hear that. Under Trump the U.S. will not do the bleeding in their fight.</p> <p>There is also no mention of human rights, Khashoggi, freedom, or Palestinian statehood.</p> <p>The speech ends as it started, with praising "America’s innate goodness".</p> <p>Daniel Larison calls the speech <span><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/pompeos-exercise-in-arrogant-self-congratulation/">Pompeo’s Exercise in Arrogant Self-Congratulation</a></span>. That fits well.</p> <p>For the people and the rulers in the Middle East the speech offers nothing. They are told that they are on their own. The U.S. will not longer play the "shinning city upon a hill" and it will no longer do the fighting for other interests. It wants purely transactional relations but with as little physical involvement as possible.</p> <p>There is a lot of support for Israel in the speech and an equal amount of bashing Iran. But there is no promise that the U.S. is willing to do more than verbal grandstanding and to keep up the ineffective 'squeezing' of Iran.</p> <p>Overall Pompeo's speech was directed more at a U.S. audience that to a Middle Eastern public. Iran hawks, evangelicals and President Trump will love it. Liberal interventionists and neo-conservatives will criticize it. </p> <p><span><a href="https://www.moonofalabama.org/2019/01/pompeos-middle-east-speech-a-blustering-push-for-less-us-involvement.html">https://www.moonofalabama.org/2019/01/pompeos-middle-east-speech-a-blustering-push-for-less-us-involvement.html</a></span></p> <p><span>Remark: More on this speech Yemen War Mosaic 501, cp9.</span></p> <p><span>(* B K P)</span></p> <p>The War on Terror's Total Cost: $5,900,000,000,000</p> <p>And counting. The real question: Is America any safer?</p> <p><span>B</span>y any reasonable estimate, the monetary and human costs of the U.S.-led war on terrorism has been considerable. To the political scientists at Brown University, the numbers have been astronomical. The Ivy League university’s Cost of War Project calculates that Washington will spend approximately <span><a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2018/Crawford_Costs%20of%20War%20Estimates%20Through%20FY2019.pdf">$5.9 trillion </a></span>between FY2001-FY2019, a pot of money that includes over $2 trillion in overseas contingency operations, $924 billion in homeland security spending, and $353 billion in medical and disability care for U.S. troops serving in overseas conflict zones. Add the cost of interest to borrowed money into the equation, and the American people will be paying back the debt for decades to come.</p> <p>The never-ending war on terrorism, of course, has also twisted the U.S. Armed Forces into a pretzel. With the United States operating in <span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/map-shows-places-world-where-us-military-operates-180970997/">40 percent </a></span>of the world’s countries and leading sixty-five separate security training programs from the jungles of Columbia to the jungles of Thailand, is it any wonder why defense-minded think tanks, the Pentagon leadership and the armed services committees continue to talk about a readiness crisis? Washington is deploying troops, trainers and advisers to so many places that even America’s elected representatives are frequently in the dark about how the military is being used, what it is doing and where it is operating. Indeed, when four U.S. special forces troops were ambushed and killed by a small group of Islamic State-affiliated tribal fighters during a joint U.S. <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/world/middleeast/army-niger-members-punished.html">raid</a></span> near the Niger-Mali border, lawmakers in Washington were aghast that American soldiers were in Niger to begin with. In a televised admission about how out-of-the-loop lawmakers were, Sen. Lindsey Graham <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/23/politics/niger-troops-lawmakers/index.html">commented</a></span> that “[w]e don't know exactly where we're at in the world, militarily, and what we're doing.”</p> <p>Presumably, all of this expenditure of monetary and military resources should buy Americans at least a decent level of security. The high investment would be worth it if the United States was any safer from terrorism.

In July, the head of Yemen’s Supreme Political Council, Mahdi al-Mashat, urged Russia to intervene on behalf of the Houthis in Hodeidah, and <span><a href="https://yemen-rw.org/president-mahdi-al-mashat-calls-on-russia-to-help-end-war-on-yemen/">wrote a letter</a></span> to Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Although Mashat’s letter to Putin did not result in a Russian military intervention in Yemen, Abdulsalam Mohammed, the director of the Abaad Center for Studies, told Al-Monitorthat Russia subsequently exerted pressure on the Houthis to engage in multilateral peace talks and to desist from capturing and torturing political prisoners.</p> <p>While the exact role of Russia in encouraging the Houthis to come to the table in Stockholm is unclear, Moscow’s outreach toward the Houthis is viewed favorably, even by political factions that are stridently critical of Houthi military activities.</p> <p>Although Russia refuses to recognize the legitimacy of the Houthi seizure of Sanaa in 2014, Russia has engaged with the Houthis more actively than any other great power because of its belief in the necessity of a political solution to the Yemen conflict. This pattern of dialogue has made the Houthis receptive to Russia’s demands and given Moscow a more prominent role in ending the Yemeni civil war – by Samuel Ramani</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/01/russia-yemen-houthis-mediation.html">https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/01/russia-yemen-houthis-mediation.html</a></span></p> <p><span>(* B P)</span></p> <p>Despite crackdown Bahrain's activists persist</p> <p>The <span><a href="http://birdbh.org/">Bahrain Institute for Rights And Democracy</a></span> says there are over 4000 political prisoners in the country, which has a population of only 1.5 million.</p> <p>Government crackdown</p> <p>The small island in the gulf has been cracking down on human rights activists.</p> <p>Generally, those who speak up against the government are Shia and against the ruling Sunni family.</p> <p>But the small kingdom wasn’t always like this, says Ali Akbar Bushehri, a Bahraini researcher and historian on Bahrain.</p> <p>“We never had this [sectarian] problem - Sunni and Shia.

Etliche Kinder und Jugendliche seien zudem von der der RSF gekidnappt worden und hätten bereits im sudanesischen Bürgerkrieg gekämpft.</p> <p>Im Jemen erwarte die sudanesischen Kinder und Jugendlichen eine grausame Realität.

It provides about 25% of food consumed in the country, contributes 20% of the real GDP, provides employment for 40.9% of the total employed population and spreads geographically in rural areas where pockets of poverty are concentrated.</p> <p>Wheat is a strategic and essential commodity for food security worldwide and is more important in Yemen as an essential component in daily meals of consumers in different population groups and regions. However, domestic wheat production is limited and shrinking against the growing consumer needs. Thus, the sufficiency rate of wheat declined to less than 5%. To bridge the wheat food gap that is estimated at more than 3 million metric tons per annum, Yemen imports more than 95% of its wheat consumption needs from abroad.</p> <p>Wheat imports ranked first among the top 30 imported commodities in 2016, and the wheat import bill is weighing on economy and the national currency, exceeding $700 million annually. This has impacted the population’s essential food and food security and made it vulnerable to exchange rate shocks and international price fluctuations of wheat which, among other factors, led to an increase in local wheat prices by 377.4% during January 2015-October 2018.</p> <p>In light of this, this edition provides a set of policies aimed at reducing wheat consumption, increasing wheat production and easing the burden of imports on consumers, including the importance of allocating part of donor’s in-kind food aid to support farmers of wheat and other cereals to shift from food aid consumption to essential crop production.</p> <p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-2018-socio-economic-update-issue-38-november-2018-enar">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-2018-socio-economic-update-issue-38-november-2018-enar</a></span></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp14 Terrorismus / Terrorism</span></h2> <p>Siehe / Look at cp6</p> <p><span>(A T)</span></p> <p>So far in 2019, <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jihad?src=hash">#jihad</a></span> groups in <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a></span> are mainly focused on targeting each other. <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AQAP?src=hash">#AQAP</a></span> claimed 12 ops in 1st 2 weeks of January: 8 vs <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IslamicState?src=hash">#IslamicState</a></span> &amp; just 1 vs Houthis in al-Bayda', &amp; 3 vs <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UAE?src=hash">#UAE</a></span>-backed forces in Abyan.

CODEPINK’s Medea Benjamin warns this pro-arms manufacturer campaign is infiltrating our schools.</p> <p>Top U.S. weapons manufacturers have launched a public relations offensive to portray their companies as progressive and feminist, and corporate media networks have helped these corporations try to rebrand as ‘woke.’ Lockheed Martin has led the charge targeting women in science, technology, engineering, and math, or STEM, fields. The weapons corporation, which is creating bombs that Saudi Arabia is dropping on school buses full of children in Yemen, is trying to recruit women into the arms industry by telling them it will fulfill their dreams.</p> <p>To do so, Lockheed Martin has even tried to co-opt the legacy of the legendary black activist and writer Langston Hughes, exploiting his poem A Dream Deferred. Fellow weapons manufacturer Raytheon, which has also profited from unimaginable death and civilian suffering in Yemen, is trying an even more shocking strategy: The corporation has teamed up with the Girl Scouts to salvage its image.</p> <p>For its part, the corporate media has diligently regurgitated these PR talking points from the corporate death profiteer rebranding campaign. Politico is celebrating how women took over the military-industrial complex. The news website’s deputy defence editor, David Brown, who has an extensive history in military reporting at pro-U.S. military publications, praised what he called the watershed–the culmination of decades of women knocking down barriers. MSNBC also joined in the celebration of the military-industrial complex.</p> <p><span><a href="https://therealnews.com/stories/media-whitewashing-the-blood-soaked-us-military-industrial-complex">https://therealnews.com/stories/media-whitewashing-the-blood-soaked-us-military-industrial-complex</a></span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>Yemeni Interior Minister reveals Houthi militia's involvement in ISIS, terrorist attacks</p> <p>Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Interior Ahmad al-Maysari has revealed Houthi militia's involvement in many terrorist operations targeted military and security commanders in the transitional capital Aden and some liberated provinces.<br /> Al-Maysari supported his statements with strong evidences of Houthi support for terrorist networks- the Islamic State for Iraq and Sham (ISIS) and al-Qaeda- for destabilizing liberated provinces and sending messages that the government and its security forces are unable to perform their tasks of keeping security and stability in liberated provinces.<br /> In a press conference held here on Tuesday, he pointed out that the ministry of interior and anti-terror forces have arrested terrorist cell for carrying out assassinations and terrorist attacks in Aden in Lahj Province during the past few days, confirming that the cell has been financed by Iran-backed Houthi militia.<br /> " The terrorist cell acknowledged that they received training in Dhamar and Sana'a provinces by Houthi commanders for carrying out assassinations and bombings in the transitional capital Aden and liberated provinces for destabilizing public stability of citizens and convinced thy carried out assassinations and bombings targeted military and security commanders in Aden," said Minister al-Maysari.<br /> He further said the ministry of interior has a file containing all strong evidences on Houthi militia's involvement in supporting and financing terrorists of ISIS and al-Qaeda and already supplied many terrorist operations and the ministry will provide evidences on such involvement to all embassies, especially embassies of countries fighting terrorism for defining their clear positions and blacklisting Houthi militia as terrorist group.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=1874851">https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=1874851</a></span></p> <p><span>and also </span><span><a href="http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163201">http://almasdaronline.com/articles/163201</a></span></p> <p><span>Remark: The first report was they had caught the cell which was responsible for cooperation on the ground to manage the Anad base attack and attacks on military targets (look at cp6); now the story seems to be enlarged for propaganda reasons.</span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>Future War on Parade in Yemen</p> <p>The nonstate Houthis used an Iranian-model drone to attack the Yemeni military’s top brass in a preview of how the next wars in the Middle East will be fought</p> <p>Here’s a disquieting inversion of business as usual: A Middle Eastern militant group just used a drone in an attempted decapitation strike on a state military, an operation that required significant advanced planning and intelligence collection.</p> <p>Neither side in Yemen’s civil war has seemed overly concerned with the niceties of humanitarian law, but the Al-Anad attack was particularly brazen. The Houthis and the government were under a fragile ceasefire.</p> <p>If the intention of this attack was to foreclose on a negotiated end to Yemen’s war and further enmesh Saudi Arabia and its allies in a demoralizing and reputation-shredding military campaign—as well as to kill as many high-ranking Yemeni military and political officials as possible—there’s a better-than-even chance the strategy will work.</p> <p>The Houthis are not the only Iranian client with drone capabilities.</p> <p>Al-Anad is one of the most sophisticated aerial attacks ever to be carried out by a nonstate group.

The aerial attack drones are the latest sophisticated weapon that Iran appears to have sent to the Houthis whom they support. Houthi rebels have used them to collect intelligence on the Yemeni legitimate government and the Saudi led coalition forces, to attack the Yemeni legitimate government and Saudi led coalition forces, to disable Saudi-led coalition missile defenses, and to conduct cross border attacks against targets in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Security in Yemen has become an international concern because of its proximity to Saudi Arabia, the strategic Bab al-Mandab straits and the discovery of terrorist plots being hatched against the US and Britain.</p> <p>Yemen’s Houthi militia has begun employing drones to strike positions affiliated with the Yemeni government and a Saudi-led Arab coalition in Yemen, and since April 2018 they attempted to strike targets in Saudi territory as well.</p> <p>The Houthis claimed that the Qasef-1 drone is an indigenous design and construction but experts said that the drones were supplied by Iran – charges the group and Tehran deny.</p> <p>In spite of the efforts of the Saudi coalition the legitimate Yemeni government and the American support, the terror attacks are likely to continue and even increase in frequency as long as there is no strong political settlement and the military-security services of Yemen remain divided and weak – by Shaul Shay</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/node/37099">https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/node/37099</a></span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p><span>Film: </span>Pompeo: A real democracy doesn’t support Hezbollah.

For four years, they have been loudly and loudly challenging the legitimacy of the international recognized government and even the legitimacy of the UN Security Council itself. At some points of time, under pressures, they conceded the necessity of handing over power and cities as per the UN Security Council resolutions. But the theocratic organization's preplanned maneuvers usually range from accepting peace talks without showing up in them, through showing up but miring the talks in countless hairsplitting and withdrawing under any excuse before a deal is reached, to signing the deal but then escaping its binding terms by countless hairsplitting on what they mean.</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-26864">https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-26864</a></span></p> <p><span>(A P)</span></p> <p>The Iranian agents at Yemen talks</p> <p>IT seems as if the East and West alike do not want a solution to the Yemen crisis and instead they want to prolong the war so they can exploit more of our natural resources and hinder our developmental leap.

Is it possible that the United Nations, when the Yemeni national army was closing in on Al-Hodeida to liberate it, jumps to rescue the Houthis by holding needless meetings and conventions here and there with the aim of buying time for the militia to regroup, replenish supplies and reposition? Why can't the UN leave the legitimate Yemeni army to finish the task of eradicating these outlaws?</p> <p>Doesn't the UN want the Yemeni people to get rid of a gang that stole their money from the banks?

It's not Americans who are killing Yemenis; we are killing the terrorists who are actively seeking to kill Americans from within Yemen.

The use of cheap drones for armed attack is a growing trend in the region’s myriad of conflicts.</p> <p>However, over the past 13 years, the Houthis have access to more open source satellite imagery, which has allowed them to identify targets, and then been able to use the war-time conditions in Yemen to further experiment and innovate. The result is the Houthis are using drones in ways reminiscent of precision-guided-munitions, over far greater distances than other insurgent groups in the Middle East.</p> <p>The Qasef-1 provides the operator with a number of advantages over the off-the-shelf drones that have proliferated widely in Iraq and that the Islamic State used to harass Operation Inherent Resolve troops in Mosul and Syria. </p> <p>That’s not to say that the Ababil-T is a technological wonder. It has decades-old technology derived from target drones designed to be used for target practice. It’s cheap, easy to manufacture, easily transportable, and requires relatively little supporting logistics to operate. A quick look at the United Nations Panel of Experts on Yemen <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/letter-dated-26-january-2018-panel-experts-yemen-mandated-security-council-resolution">January 2018 report</a></span> shows that much of the technology is commercially derived from global suppliers.</p> <p>The Houthis have leveraged low-technology to befuddle a technologically superior ally – by Aaron Stein</p> <p><a href="https://www.fpri.org/article/2019/01/low-tech-high-reward-the-houthi-drone-attack/">https://www.fpri.org/article/2019/01/low-tech-high-reward-the-houthi-drone-attack/</a></p> <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp18 Sonstiges / Other</span></h2> <p>(* B )</p> <p>As Yemen descends into war, these young filmmakers defy the risk to capture the human stories</p> <p>The Houthis took over the capital, Sanaa, after a five-day battle in September of last year, but Hussain stayed. He doesn’t take sides in the conflict, but focuses on telling the stories of regular Yemenis through the video documentary collective he co-founded in 2011, SupportYemen.</p> <p>“I didn’t know much about politics,” Hussain says in a phone interview. “I didn’t know what’s leftist and what’s rightist. All I knew was how to pick up a camera and tell a story. So basically, that’s what I did.”</p> <p>SupportYemen was formed at a dramatic and ultimately tragic moment in the Yemen conflict. In September of 2011, just as it seemed protests had achieved one of their main objectives with longtime dictator President Ali Abdullah agreeing to step down, the deal collapsed and tribal fighters, allied with defected army units, resumed fighting government forces for control of the capital. This phase in the long and protracted Yemeni conflict became known as the second phase of the Battle of Sanaa.</p> <p>Hussain despaired at the turn of events. He had recently finished his stint as assistant director for “Karama Has No Walls,” the film that would eventually get the Oscar nomination. He decided he needed to do something, and that something ended up becoming #SupportYemen, an idea he developed with co-founder Sarah Ahmed. The two recruited eight more founding members.</p> <p><span><a href="http://www.kazu.org/post/yemen-descends-war-these-young-filmmakers-defy-risk-capture-human-stories#stream/0">http://www.kazu.org/post/yemen-descends-war-these-young-filmmakers-defy-risk-capture-human-stories#stream/0</a></span></p> <p>(* B )</p> <p>Filme: Reise im Jemen, vor dem Krieg / Films: Traveling Yemen, before the war</p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnr_znNwyAA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnr_znNwyAA</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXsj5cmEPJQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXsj5cmEPJQ</a></span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdlheillk3c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdlheillk3c</a></span></p> <p>(B)</p> <p>Film: As my family and I made our way along eastern Yemen, we found lovely remote beaches all along the route from Aden to Abyan to Shabwah, but the most beautiful gems were the beaches of Hadhramaut, west of Al Mukalla city.
