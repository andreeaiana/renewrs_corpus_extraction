monarchy in the world – one with few democratic inclinations of its own – send armed forces and air defenses into its southern neighbor to surround a session of parliament and ensure it proceeded. The session was held in neither Yemen’s capital, nor the government’s interim capital; the members of parliament (MPs) were elected 16 years earlier – so long ago that 39 of them had since passed away; and, despite members being promised 500,000 Saudi riyals each just to attend, the session did not make quorum. But such was the case for legitimacy last month in Sayoun, Hadramawt governorate, where President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi convened the Yemeni government for the first time in four years – before traveling back to his home-in-exile in Riyadh.</p><p>Simultaneously, 600 kilometers away in Sana’a, the armed Houthi movement – which deposed Hadi in a 2015 coup with the help of the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, whom they later murdered – was racing to assert its own legitimacy, staging bi-elections to replace 24 of the deceased MPs. The Houthi leadership, since taking control of the capital, has also regularly staged parliamentary meetings lacking quorum. The reality is that while neither of Yemen’s warring sides can rightly claim the constitutional authority to carry out the functions of parliament, their attempts to do so magnify the rupture of parliament as a national institution.</p><p>For Hadi, the Sayoun session was a double-edged sword. While it ostensibly demonstrated that he was at the head of a government, reconvening MPs also demonstrated that there is a government beneath him – one which would constitutionally have the right to replace him should the president die or be otherwise unable to fulfill his duties. Put differently: the only real leverage Hadi had over his Saudi patrons was that they needed him, even if only as a figurehead, to legitimize their intervention in Yemen; now, Riyadh has a plausible Plan ‘B’. </p><p>All of this also took place within the context of the Houthi forces’ most significant battlefield gains since the Saudi-led coalition began its intervention in the Yemen conflict in 2015.</p><p>Hadi Government Holds Parliamentary Session Despite Falling Short of Quorum</p><p>The meeting also came only two months after the separatist Southern Transitional Council’s (STC) would-be parliament, the Southern National Assembly, <span><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/7162#Warring-Parties-Tussle-Over-Parliamentary-Legitimacy">held their second session in Mukalla</a></span>, Hadramawt governorate.<sup>[2]</sup></p><p>Formal outcomes of the April 13-16 parliamentary session, staged in Sayoun, Hadramawt, were limited to the ratification of the new state budget and the election of a new speaker</p><p>The 301-seat House of Representatives was elected in 2003, with its term extended in 2009 through a deal between former President Saleh and opposition parties</p><p>This left 273 living MPs who could potentially have attended the April session in Sayoun. According to the Yemeni constitution, parliamentary quorum requires the attendance of at least half of the members plus one – a mark which the Sayoun session failed to meet, with only 118 MPs present. The STC said that the parliamentary session was unconstitutional and those STC members who are also member of the House of Representatives did not attend.</p><p>Regardless of the event’s questionable legality, staging it offered the Hadi government an opportunity to assert its continued international recognition and the continuity of parliament as an institution.</p><p>Military and Security Developments</p><p>Houthis Forces Make Largest Territorial Advances Since 2015</p><p>While the UN-brokered ceasefire generally held in Hudaydah City, frontlines in other areas saw increased hostilities in April. Al-Dhalea governorate – situated in Yemen’s southwest – saw some of the most intense fighting, as well as neighboring governorates of Abyan, Lahj and al-Bayda. Major escalations took place in al-Dhalea’s northern and western areas bordering the governorates of Ibb and Taiz, respectively, where Houthi forces made gains in Qa’ataba and Hasha districts. Houthi forces also claimed to have taken control of Dhi Na’im district in neighboring al-Bayda governorate. Given their strategic location between Sana’a and Aden, al-Dhalea and al-Bayda act as a gateway between Yemen’s northern and southern governorates. Houthi forces made headway into areas historically seen as part of southern Yemen, giving additional symbolic value to these territorial gains.</p><p>Economic Developments</p><p>Warring Parties’ Economic Conflict Spurs Fuel Shortages in Northern Yemen</p><p>Fuel Crisis Becomes Political Football Between Warring Parties</p><p>Severe Shortage of Basic Commodities Imminent</p><p>Etc.</p><p><span><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/7357">http://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/7357</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen's divided parliament growing further apart</strong></p><p>As fighting continued in other areas of the country, part of Yemen's divided parliament met April 13 in Seyon for the first time since the civil war began four years ago</p><p>The head of the <span><a href="http://www.almotamarenglish.net/">General People's Congress</a></span>, Sultan al-Barqani, was unanimously <span><a href="https://www.sabanew.net/viewstory/48224">elected speaker</a></span> by the 138 members who attended. Later, six more members attended subsequent sessions. The full parliament has 301 members.</p><p>In an <span><a href="http://www.sabanew.net/viewstory/48361">April 16 statement</a></span>, Barqani described the first session as “historic.”</p><p>While the parliamentary session could be seen as further fragmentation of the Yemeni state <span><a href="https://www.al-tagheer.com/news93439.html">amid the division</a></span> between the internationally recognized government and the Houthis over the executive and judicial authorities, it pulled the rug out from under the 116 parliamentarians in Sanaa supporting the <span><a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/yemen-s-parliament-to-hold-first-session-since-civil-war-started-1.843711">Houthis</a></span>. That part of the parliament, which had resumed sessions in <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/members-yemens-parliament-meet-first-time-during-civil-war">August 2016</a></span>, is headed by Yahya al-Rai.</p><p>Trying to muster enough members for a quorum (half the total membership plus one, or 151), the Houthis also <span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/ar/news436856.htm">held </a><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/ar/news436856.htm">elections</a></span> April 13 to fill the vacant seats of 34 deceased parliamentarians. But the elections only filled the <span><a href="http://www.sabanews.net/ar/news533252.htm">24 seats</a></span> in Houthi-controlled areas, leaving the Sanaa part of parliament with 140 seats.</p><p>The divided parliament is an extension of the split in Yemen’s other state institutions between the Houthis’ authority and the internationally recognized government. The country’s <span><a href="http://www.saba.ye/ar/">official news outlet</a></span> produces <span><a href="http://www.sabanew.net/home/ar">two versions</a></span> of the news.

The massive blast injured more than 100 children and adults in the residential Sawan neighborhood. The groups could not determine the initial cause of the fire at the warehouse. Witnesses did not see or hear aircraft, but the Saudi Arabia-owned al-Arabiya published and broadcast – then deleted – reports that the Saudi-led coalition had carried out an airstrike in the area that day.</p><p>After the midday explosion, scores of Houthi security forces arrived at the site, fired warning shots, and beat and detained several people who tried to photograph the warehouse, witnesses said. For several days, Houthi forces removed large quantities of undisclosed materials from the site on flatbed trucks, and prevented human rights researchers from accessing the area until April 11.</p><p>“The Houthi authorities need to provide credible information and stop storing large concentrations of volatile materials in densely populated areas,” said Radhya al-Mutawakel, the chairperson of Mwatana for Human Rights. “The Houthis played a role in the tragedy and should hold responsible officials to account and provide compensation to victims.”</p><p>Mwatana and Human Rights Watch determined, based on in-person interviews with witnesses, videos, and satellite imagery, that the contents of the warehouse had caught fire and exploded. The groups were unable to identify the warehouse contents, but available information shows that they were flammable and explosive, posing a foreseeable danger to civilians living and going to school in the area.</p><p>Witnesses to the explosion said that they did not see the initial cause of the fire at the warehouse, but none saw or heard aircraft or incoming munitions before the fire began, or at the time of the large explosion several minutes later. Four videos of the blast that bystanders recorded and uploaded to the internet within hours also do not indicate the cause of the fire, but show nothing to suggest an airstrike or incoming munition.

The United Nations children’s agency, UNICEF, <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/blast-sana-kills-another-14-children-school-and-injures-16-most-under-age-nine">reported</a></span> that “it was almost lunchtime and students were in class,” and dozens were killed and wounded.</p><p>Of the 15 children killed, Mwatana identified the names and ages of 10 girls and a boy who died at two schools, and 17 girls and 12 boys who were wounded, most of them 11 or 12 years old. At least 45 children were wounded, 5 critically, as well as at least 58 adults, based on interviews with people present at the two schools and at three private hospitals that received the dead and wounded. The actual death toll may be higher. Some blast victims who were in critical condition were evacuated to public hospitals run by Houthi authorities, where hospital officials did not agree to speak to human rights groups.</p><p>Students and teachers at al-Ra’ee public school, with roughly 2,000 students, located about 250 meters west of the explosion, identified nine schoolgirls there who died. The explosion caused many of the girls to run in panic along the balconies outside their classrooms to the stairwell, where some fell and were trampled, witnesses said. When the stairwell became blocked, some girls still on the top floor of the three-story building died when they jumped or fell from the building. Staff at one hospital said that three girls whose bodies were received at the hospital had been trampled to death, and that most wounded children admitted to the hospital had been cut by broken glass.</p><p>Some <span><a href="https://www.savethechildren.org/us/about-us/media-and-news/2019-press-releases/save-the-children-staff-describes-devastation-sanaa">children at al-Ra’ee school</a></span> “died in their classrooms,” Save the Children said, apparently due to wounds caused by the blast. Another schoolgirl died from unknown causes “due to lack of equipment and supplies in the hospital.” A Save the Children employee rescued a wounded 14-year-old girl who told him, “I will never go to school again.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch and Mwatana were unable to conclusively determine what material was stored in the Sawan facility. The researchers observed widespread blast damage, and the fuze of a hand grenade found near the warehouse. If Houthi forces stored material such as munitions or fuel for military purposes at the site, they would be in violation of the laws-of-war obligations to take <span><a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule22">all feasible precautions</a></span> to <span><a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule23">avoid placing military targets</a></span> within or near densely populated areas, and to protect civilians from the danger resulting from military operations.</p><p>“The Houthis’ decision to store volatile material near homes and schools despite the foreseeable risk to civilians led to the death and injury of dozens of schoolchildren and adults,” said Bill Van Esveld, senior children’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Houthis should stop covering up what happened in Sawan and start doing more to protect civilians under their control.”</p><p>For details about the April 7 blast and its consequences, please see below (with photos)</p><p><span><a href="http://mwatana.org/en/warehouse-blast-kills-schoolchildren/">http://mwatana.org/en/warehouse-blast-kills-schoolchildren/</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/05/09/yemen-warehouse-blast-kills-schoolchildren">https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/05/09/yemen-warehouse-blast-kills-schoolchildren</a></span> = <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-warehouse-blast-kills-schoolchildren-enar">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-warehouse-blast-kills-schoolchildren-enar</a></span></p><p>Short film: <span><a href="https://twitter.com/MwatanaEn/status/1126386749389856769">https://twitter.com/MwatanaEn/status/1126386749389856769</a></span></p><p>And a very short survey <span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-7009755/Group-accuses-Yemen-rebels-storing-weapons-near-civilians.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-7009755/Group-accuses-Yemen-rebels-storing-weapons-near-civilians.html</a></span></p><p><span>Comment: </span>It sounds as if a warehouse storing explosives was situated in a residential area, then bombed by Saudi Arabia, then as they found there were civilian casualties Saudi news agencies removed the reference to the bombing.

One study provided an impact evaluation of the current Cash-for-Nutrition program of the Social Fund for Development (SFD), conducted during the civil war, and the other presents a retrospective analysis of the Social Welfare Fund’s (SWF) unconditional cash transfer program during a conflict period preceding the outbreak of the ongoing civil war. Both studies found transfers created substantial benefits on child nutrition outcomes.</p><p>The SWF program identified and provided quarterly cash transfers to vulnerable households in Yemen prior to the conflict. Currently, the same targeting is being used in the Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Program for a <span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/yemen/partners_12454.html">national cash transfer program</a></span> implemented through UNICEF.</p><p>Using data from the National Social Protection Monitoring Survey, <span><a href="https://doi.org/10.2499/9780896293601">Ecker and co-authors show</a></span> that receiving SWF cash transfers decreased the size of the negative impact of conflict on acute malnutrition by at least half, from 2012 to 2013. </p><p>The SFD’s Cash-for-Nutrition program (also funded through the Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Program) provides SWF households with young children with additional monthly cash transfers equivalent to about 25% of their food budget and encourages attendance at monthly child and maternal nutrition education trainings led by locally recruited community health educators.</p><p>Using data from a randomized control trial designed during the pilot phase of the Cash-for-Nutrition program, <span><a href="https://doi.org/10.2499/9780896293601">Kurdi and co-authors report</a></span> the program had significant impacts on offsetting negative trends in nutrition outcomes during the conflict years 2015-2017.

Together they represent a significant resource for meeting the <span><a href="https://www.scidev.net/global/health/nutrition/">nutritional</a></span> needs of local communities and <span><a href="https://www.scidev.net/global/agriculture/livestock/">livestock</a></span>.<br /> However, mismanagement and unsystematic usage have led to a dramatic decrease of these resources. And the desperate need for firewood has sent prices soaring, making selling it a lucrative business. Officials from the Environment Protection Authority say the availability of modern tools like chainsaws has facilitated the felling of trees and wild bushes, with a disregard for environmental, social and economic consequences.<br /> A study by the authority found that excessive firewood gathering is leading to a rapid deterioration of the country’s <span><a href="https://www.scidev.net/global/agriculture/forestry/">forests</a></span> and negatively impacting the environment and local communities.<br /> Soil in deforested areas has become vulnerable to wind and <span><a href="https://www.scidev.net/global/environment/water/">water</a></span> erosion, leading in turn to a decrease in groundwater levels and heightened risk of floods, the study showed.<br /> Excessive firewood gathering also affects wildlife and environmental balance, because of the <span><a href="https://www.scidev.net/global/governance/migration/">migration</a></span> of some birds and animals after losing their natural habitat – by Adel Aldaghbashy</p><p><span><a href="https://www.scidev.net/global/environment/news/yemen-s-forests-another-casualty-of-war-amid-fuel-crisis.html">https://www.scidev.net/global/environment/news/yemen-s-forests-another-casualty-of-war-amid-fuel-crisis.html</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B E H)</strong></p><p><strong>Für 5.000 Dollar: Zehntausende jemenitische Nieren in Ägypten verkauft</strong></p><p>In ägyptischen Krankenhäusern kommen verzweifelte Menschen für einen illegalen Handel zusammen: Emiratis, Saudis und Ägypter, die eine Organtransplantation benötigen und Jemeniten, die ihre Organe geradezu verscherbeln.

Der Händlerring scheint den Recherchen zufolge teils über Bedarf und Angebot der Vermittler selbst und ihres direkten Umfelds entstanden oder zumindest gewachsen zu sein.</p><p>In Ägypten wurden Menschen zu Vermittlern, deren Angehörige Organe benötigten, während im Jemen Spender wiederum andere Spender vermittelten. Beispielsweise wurde einem Mann, der selbst erwogen hatte, Organe zu spenden aber mit den Klienten nicht kompatibel war, angeraten, andere Empfänger im Jemen zu finden, die bereit wären, eine Niere zu verkaufen. Hierfür soll er eine Provision von 1.000 Dollar pro passendem Spender erhalten haben.</p><p>Makler in Ägypten würden die Reisen, Unterkünfte und Operationen organisieren. Laut der jemenitischen Nichtregierungsorganisation zur Bekämpfung des Menschenhandels konnten rund 1.000 Fälle von Organverkäufen überprüft werden.

Local structures of authority have emerged, along with a plethora of para-state agents and militias at the behest of local elites and international patrons. According to the UN Panel of Experts, despite the disappearance of central authority, “Yemen, as a State, has all but ceased to exist,” replaced by distinct statelets fighting against each other (<span><a href="https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2018_68.pdf">UN Panel of Experts, 26 January 2018</a></span>).</p><p>This is the first report of a three-part analysis series exploring the fragmentation of state authority in Southern Yemen, where a secessionist body – the Southern Transitional Council (STC) – has established itself, not without contestation, as the “legitimate representative” of the Southern people (<span><a href="https://en.stcaden.com/news/8470">Southern Transitional Council, 7 December 2018</a></span>). Since its emergence in 2017, the STC has evolved into a state-like entity with an executive body (the Leadership Council), a legislature (the Southern National Assembly), and armed forces, although the latter are under the virtual command structure of the Interior ministry in the internationally-recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Investigating conflict dynamics in seven southern governorates, these reports seek to highlight how Southern Yemen is all but a monolithic unit, reflecting the divided loyalties and aspirations of its political communities.</p><p>This first report focuses on the oil-producing regions of Shabwah and Hadramawt (highlighted in the map below). Both governorates have long enjoyed a high degree of autonomy from the central government but have been struggling to invest their oil and gas revenues into local development projects. Alongside an endemic presence of Islamist militants affiliated with the local branch of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a fragile security situation has exacerbated tensions between the state and the local authorities.</p><p>Shabwah</p><p>Between 2015 and 2017, Shabwah was one of the central frontlines in the conflict between Houthi-Saleh forces and Hadi loyalists. A largely tribal territory with little penetration from the central government, Shabwah was a long-time stronghold of Saleh’s General People’s Congress (GPC). The co-option of tribal shaykhs and other influential local elites made it easier for Saleh and the then-allied Houthi forces to overrun the provincial capital Ataq in April 2015 (<span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/houthis-capture-ataq-city-saudi-led-air-strikes-150409130453991.html">Al-Jazeera, 9 April 2015</a></span>). Although coalition-backed pro-Hadi troops retook Ataq only four months later, Houthi-Saleh forces continued to control the westernmost districts of Bayhan and Usaylan, which lied along profitable smuggling routes (<span><a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2017-12-20-yemen-national-chaos-local-order-salisbury2.pdf">Salisbury, 20 December 2017</a></span>). The Yemeni army, largely consisting of Hadi-aligned brigades, and allied local fighters eventually recaptured Shabwah in December 2017, just weeks after the crumbling of the Houthi-Saleh alliance culminated in the assassination of the former president and his long-time Shabwani collaborator Arif Al-Zuka. Following the end of the hostilities, the security situation in Shabwah improved markedly, as illustrated by the number of reported fatalities, which decreased from 1,092 in 2017 to 97 in 2018 (see Figure 1).</p><p>Hadramawt</p><p>While it was spared from any Houthi incursions, the governorate of Hadramawt made the headlines during the current Yemen conflict when AQAP took over its capital, Mukalla, in April 2015. Exploiting the security breakdown that followed the ousting of President Hadi, the organisation presented itself as a Sunni bulwark against the Shi’a Houthi threat, and managed to run Hadramawt’s capital for an entire year (<span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/mukalla-yemen-al-qaeda-civil-war-before-after-jihadi-terror-group-a8495636.html">The Independent, 17 August 2018</a></span>). It gradually laid down roots in the city, capitalising on the grievances of a population that had long been marginalised by the central authorities, all the while “taking a relatively accommodating and flexible approach toward the social imposition of its ideology” (<span><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/7306">Radman, 16 April 2019</a></span>).</p><p>The control of Yemen’s third largest port and the country’s fifth largest city, with a population of around 500,000, arguably allowed the organisation to become “stronger than at any time since it first emerged almost 20 years ago”; helped by daily revenues from port customs amounting to $2 million, AQAP operated as a quasi-state in Mukalla, providing its residents with basic services like water and electricity (<span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/yemen-aqap/">Reuters, 5 April 2016</a></span>).

He vowed to work against any such move, stating that it would create divisions and more conflict between Yemenis. Despite official denial, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is a member of the Saudi-led coalition, supports the formation of local militias in Socotra. Local militias were formed in other southern Yemeni governorates by UAE-backed South Yemeni secessionists, which have gained more power during the war (<span><a href="https://almahrahpost.com/news/10602#.XMzInq2ZOqC">al-Mahrah Post</a></span>, April 29).</p><p>Yemenis frequently raise concerns that the UAE wants to dominate shipping routes by controlling Aden and the Bab al-Mandab strait.</p><p>The main flashpoint in the course of the Yemeni-UAE struggle in Socotra took place in April 2018.

The UAE has also failed to win over key tribal leaders</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Socotra is far from the heart of the Yemeni conflict, but a distinct power struggle has taken shape there. The Yemeni nationalist sentiment has been on the rise on the island in the face of the UAE’s moves. However, if the situation in Yemen keeps deteriorating and the county disintegrates further, some Socotrans might eventually prefer to join the UAE. That scenario has the potential of starting a new chapter in the Yemen war—this time between nationalists and pro-UAE groups, while causing more regional disputes over the UAE’s expansion.</p><p>The power struggle continues in Socotra with the possibility of escalation. The UAE seems to have abandoned the direct military deployment approach in favor of forming allied local militias.

The United Nations Mission to Support the Hudaydah Agreement (UNMHA) will monitor and report on this unilateral redeployment, which will commence on 11 May 2019 and be completed by 14 May 2019.<br /> The RCC Chair notes that this is a first practical step on the ground since the conclusion of the Hudaydah Agreement, but stresses that it must be followed by the committed, transparent and sustained actions of the parties to fully deliver on their obligations. Furthermore, this unilateral redeployment should allow for establishing a UN leading role in supporting the Red Sea Ports Corporation in managing the ports, and for enhancing the UNVIM’s monitoring in accordance with the Agreement.<br /> In this regard, the full implementation of the Hudaydah Agreement remains instrumental to ensuring effective humanitarian access into Yemen where millions continue to be in need of life-saving assistance</p><p><span><a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/note-correspondents/2019-05-10/note-correspondents-statement-un-mission-support-the-hudaydah-agreement-scroll-down-for-arabic-version">https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/note-correspondents/2019-05-10/note-correspondents-statement-un-mission-support-the-hudaydah-agreement-scroll-down-for-arabic-version</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p>Yemen war: End to fighting could be in sight as Houthi rebels announce withdrawal from lifeline port</p><p>UN peace deal placed pullback of all forces from city in September, but until Saturday neither side had complied</p><p>In a major breakthrough, Mohammed al-Houthi, the head of the rebels’ Supreme Revolutionary Committee, <span><a href="https://twitter.com/Moh_Alhouthi/status/1127019926261252097">confirmed</a></span> his fighters would start pulling back at 10 am (0700 GMT) from Hodeidah port, Saleef port, used for grain, and Ras Isa, used for oil.</p><p>“The [rebel] army and committees are withdrawing unilaterally as a result of the refusal of the countries of the US-British-Saudi-Emirati aggression and their allies to implement the [Stockholm] accord,” the rebel leader said on Twitter.</p><p>General Michael Lollesgaard, the head of the UN redeployment committee, said the withdrawal of rebel forces will be completed by Tuesday. </p><p>He said a UN observer mission he would lead would monitor the movement of forces.</p><p>Moammar al-Eryani, the information minister of Yemen’s internationally recognised government, <a href="https://twitter.com/ERYANIM/status/1127019513717952512">welcomed the UN announcement</a> but warned the rebels might be trying to “mislead” the world. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-war-end-hodeidah-port-houthi-rebels-withdrawal-un-peace-deal-aid-a8909256.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-war-end-hodeidah-port-houthi-rebels-withdrawal-un-peace-deal-aid-a8909256.html</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p>(* A K P)</p><p>Audio: UN expecting Houthi withdrawal from Yemen port</p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w172wyj32hbmzmn">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w172wyj32hbmzmn</a></p><p>and</p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p>Yemeni Houthi leader says unilateral redeployment will take place today</p><p>The head of Yemeni Houthis’ Supreme Revolutionary Committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, said in a tweet on Saturday that Houthis unilateral redeployment from three main ports came as a result of the Saudi-led coalition’s refusal to implement the Stockholm Agreement, which laid out the groundwork for peace.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-houthi-agreement/yemeni-houthi-leader-says-unilateral-redeployment-will-take-place-today-idUSKCN1SH02O">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-houthi-agreement/yemeni-houthi-leader-says-unilateral-redeployment-will-take-place-today-idUSKCN1SH02O</a></span></p><p>and</p><p>(A K P)</p><p>Info Minister: Houthi redeployment offer inaccurate, misleads int’l community</p><p>Information Minister, Mo’amar al-Eryani, said that Houthi militia offer for redeployment from the three ports is inaccurate and misleading.</p><p>In series of tweets, Al-Eryani added that “any unilateral withdrawal that does not allow for joint monitoring and verification is unacceptable.”</p><p>He explained that the Houthi offer comes within the militia’s attempts to mislead the international community and Security Council in order to avoid any firm positions may be taken by the council in its next round toward the militia’s persistence on hindering the Stockholm Agreement and undermining peace efforts</p><p><span><a href="http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/05/11/info-minister-houthi-redeployment-offer-inaccurate-misleads-intl-community/">http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/05/11/info-minister-houthi-redeployment-offer-inaccurate-misleads-intl-community/</a></span></p><p>My remark: This is the reaction of the Hadi government.</p><p>(A K P)</p><p>Bin Aziz: Unilateral redeployment in Hodeidah a comic play disgracing UN</p><p>The head of the government team of the joint committee for redeployment in Hodeidah Maj.

Their fate is still unknown,” a father of two fishermen told MintPress during the protest.</p><p>According to the Legal Center for Rights and Development in Yemen, a non-governmental organization monitoring human-rights violations, the destruction of 433 fishing boats by the Saudi-led Coalition has robbed many of Hodeida’s residents of their sole source of income and ability to feed their families – by Ahmed AbdulKareem</p><p><span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/saudi-coalition-kidnaps-174-yemeni-fishermen-ignoring-provisions-ceasefire/258269">https://www.mintpressnews.com/saudi-coalition-kidnaps-174-yemeni-fishermen-ignoring-provisions-ceasefire/258269</a></span></p><p><span>My remark: This already had been reported earlier; more details here.</span></p><p><span>(A K pH)</span></p><p>VIDEO: COALITION FORCES KEEP BOMBING SEVERAL AREAS IN HODEIDAH</p><p>The coalition-backed mercenaries fired shots of medium and heavy weapons at several areas of 7 July and Khamseen street, added the source.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/video-coalition-forces-keep-bombing-several-areas-in-hodeidah/">https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/video-coalition-forces-keep-bombing-several-areas-in-hodeidah/</a></span></p><p><span>(A K pS)</span></p><p>Houthis target al-Amalika locations in Hodeidah</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/4188">http://en.adenpress.news/news/4188</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp2 Allgemein / General</span></h2><p><span>(* A K P)</span></p><p><span>Interactive Map of Yemen War</span></p><p><span><a href="https://yemen.liveuamap.com/">https://yemen.liveuamap.com/</a></span></p><p><span>(* A K)</span></p><p>ANSAR ALLAH’S ADVANCE ON QATABAH TOWN SLOWED DOWN DUE TO FIERCE RESISTANCE FROM SAUDI-LED FORCES (MAP)</p><p><span><a href="https://southfront.org/ansar-allahs-advance-on-qatabah-town-slowed-down-due-to-fierce-resistance-from-saudi-led-forces-map/">https://southfront.org/ansar-allahs-advance-on-qatabah-town-slowed-down-due-to-fierce-resistance-from-saudi-led-forces-map/</a></span></p><p>MILITARY SITUATION IN YEMEN ON MAY 11, 2019 (MAP UPDATE)</p><p><span><a href="https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-may-11-2019-map-update/">https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-may-11-2019-map-update/</a></span></p><p>MILITARY SITUATION IN YEMEN ON MAY 9, 2019 (MAP UPDATE)</p><p><span><a href="https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-may-9-2019-map-update/">https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-may-9-2019-map-update/</a></span></p><p>MILITARY SITUATION IN YEMEN ON MAY 8, 2019 (MAP UPDATE)</p><p><span><a href="https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-may-8-2019-map-update/">https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-may-8-2019-map-update/</a></span></p><p>MILITARY SITUATION IN YEMEN ON MAY 7, 2019 (MAP UPDATE)</p><p><span><a href="https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-may-7-2019-map-update/">https://southfront.org/military-situation-in-yemen-on-may-7-2019-map-update/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H K)</span></p><p>The Infernal War in Yemen: Report</p><p> It’s the war from hell, the savage one that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, along with seven other Middle Eastern and North African states, have been waging in Yemen since March 2015, with fulsome support from the Pentagon and American weapons galore. It’s got everything. </p><p>Dead children in the dozens, a never-ending air campaign that pays scant heed to civilians, famine, cholera, you name it. No wonder it’s facing mounting criticism in Congress and from human rights groups. </p><p>More than 22 million out of Yemen's total population of 29 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the the U.N. Nearly 18 million of them do not know where their next meal will come from. </p><p>Already, more than 8 million people are "facing pre-famine conditions, meaning they are entirely reliant on external aid for survival," says Mark Lowcock, the U.N.'s humanitarian chief. That number is likely to reach 14 million – half the country's population – as the effects of long-term malnutrition and compromised immune systems set in. </p><p>The situation is "catastrophic," says Caroline Seguin, program manager in Yemen for Doctors Without Borders (or MSF, the abbreviation for the organization's French name Médecins Sans Frontières.) </p><p>Youth are especially hard hit,according to the U.N., about 80 percent of Yemenis under the age of 18 are facing threats to their health and survival. </p><p>"It's a living hell for its citizens and their children – honestly," says Sherin Varkey, deputy representative of the U.N.

Eine dieser Gruppen ist die Südliche Bewegung, die sich bereits 2007 formierte. Sie arbeitet im Kampf gegen die Allianz mit der Exilregierung und der saudischen Militärkoalition zusammen, lehnt jedoch die Ergebnisse der Nationalen Dialogkonferenz ab und tritt für die Unabhängigkeit des Südens ein. Eine andere Gruppe ist die sunnitisch islamistische Islah-Partei, die den jemenitischen Ableger der Muslimbruderschaft darstellt und vornehmlich an der Erweiterung ihres eigenen Einflusses interessiert ist. Dschihadistische Gruppen wie al-Qaida auf der arabischen Halbinsel und der Islamische Staat im Jemen beteiligen sich ebenfalls an den Kämpfen.

ALL militia in Yemen must be disarmed, not just one! And keep in mind that a great part of those fighting under the command of the Houthi government at Sanaa, is the regular Yemeni army ( the larger part of it!) which sided with the Houthis in 2014/2015. While a great part of those fighting against the Houthis are various irregular militia: UAE-backed militia of southern separatists, Islah Party affiliated militia, militia under the command of former president Saleh’s son, Yemeni militia which are paid by Saudi Arabia, militia which „president“ Hadi had integrated into the (the part under his command) Yemeni army, but in reality must be labeled as „militia“. Together with the real Houthi militia (not the Yemeni army!), ALL these militia must be disarmed.</span></p><p>4a. Disarming all these militia is worthless if any non-Yemeni fighters and soldiers stay in Yemen. All Saudi and UAE troops and foreign soldiers (from Sudan and elsewhere) must leave Yemen.</p><p><span>5. Iran’s role in Yemen is very much inferior to the role of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and also their greater Western backers as the US, the UK, France. If Iran should be „sanctioned“ for its role in Yemen, obviously these five states must be sanctioned first, Iran just as the sixth one.</span></p><p><span>6.

She lost her eyesight in the right eye after her husband beat and abused her before abandoning her. She’s now living with other family members in a dilapidated shelter</p><p>In Yemen, stories like Jehan’s are common. With rapidly diminishing income opportunities, negative coping strategies, including child marriages, have become more prominent. Between 2017 and 2018, child marriage rates increased threefold for girls under 18 and humanitarian partners reported a disturbing increase in GBV incidents.</p><p>Protracted displacement remains a dangerous trigger. As people are forced to live in crowded, unsanitary conditions for long periods of time, families often choose to marry off their younger daughters in the hope to offer them a better life.</p><p>Women and girls have been suffering disproportionately from GBV, poverty and violations of basic rights even before the conflict.

Her family had fled Taiz during fighting in 2017 and have made Aden there home ever since. Last year, Hamamah she was married to 22 year old Abdullah. She was just 14</p><p>For displaced women and girls - who constitute 50 per cent of all internally displaced in Yemen - the trends are alarming as they tend to suffer most from lack of privacy, threats to safety and limited access to basic services – especially in overcrowded collective centres. The ability of displaced women and girls to reach health, nutrition and other services remains a challenge due to distance and lack of financial means to afford transportation. Displaced girls are more likely to lose access to school as families with limited resources de-prioritize their right to education.</p><p>These challenges are even more daunting for women or girls who suddenly find themselves responsible for providing for their families but have been deprived of basic education or vocational training that would prepare them for the labor market.

Sadly, the country has made no progress towards process and war continues to flourish," said Ahmed.<br /> War alone is not the only thing wrecking the lives of civilians this Ramadan. Other issues, including price hikes, shortage of fuel and the outbreak of epidemics will also make this month miserable for multitudes of civilians particularly those who reside in conflict-stricken areas. <br /> Civilians across Yemen are aware of the stark difference between Ramadan before and after the war.</p><p>Two weeks before Ramadan, the fuel crisis in Yemen began to rise. One reason is the blockade imposed by the Saudi-led Arab coalition. The second reason is the spread of rumours about the shortage of fuel and this leads some people to buy more to store it for Ramadan.</p><p>In the midst of the fuel crisis, price hikes in Ramadan form a big headache for civilians. Basheer Ali, a resident in Sanaa, told <em>The New Arab</em> that the fuel crisis has hurt people as the war does. <br /> "I am in Sanaa, feeling distant from the front lines yet I am not safe from the harsh consequences of fuel crisis. When I hear about the shortage of petrol or diesel, I know prices of commodities are to rise especially in Ramadan. The fuel crisis is a war on our livelihoods," said Ali. </p><p>"The warlords have mercilessly made us [civilians] suffer and they don't care if it is Ramadan or not," concluded Ali.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2019/5/8/yemen-welcomes-ramadan-amid-war-blockade-and-fuel-crisis">https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2019/5/8/yemen-welcomes-ramadan-amid-war-blockade-and-fuel-crisis</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><span>(* A H)</span></p><p>Ramadan in San’aa: Life Goes on despite Hiking Prices, Misery and Continued War</p><p>Miserable Ramadan</p><p>Walking between the city's old souks, you will see people purchasing their requirements in large numbers as if there is no war nor a blockade, though public servants have been paid sporadically since late 2016 when the Saudi-backed government relocated Yemen's Central Bank from Sana'a to Aden.</p><p>Most segments of society lost their jobs and resorted to work in another profession like Ali Sa'ad Taha, a newspaper vendor but now all he has is one paper on his right hand and on the other hand he carry plastic bags, his new profession.</p><p>Taha was passing on a pavement outside the old city of Sana'a as disappointment was clear on his face.

Of those, the DTM determined 873 are children. </p><p>Since last week’s headcount, more people have been brought to that site. An estimated 500 migrants are also being held in a second sports stadium in Abyan. </p><p>At the stadium in Aden, IOM is combatting the spread of communicable disease by providing water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and health services. Between 26 April and 5 May, IOM has conducted over 1,800 health consultations and rehabilitated 30 latrines. </p><p>In recent days, more than 1,400 people detained at the military camp in Lahj reportedly were released. IOM is making efforts to confirm the locations and wellbeing of all migrants released in Lahj, particularly because some had been suffering from acute watery diarrhea (AWD). </p><p>At Lahj’s Ibn Khaldoon Hospital, IOM is treating more than 70 former detainees with AWD in its newly-opened diarrhea treatment centre.

“National Vision” to Heal, Rebuild, and Modernize their War-torn Nation</p><p>In what is the most extensive national plan published by a Yemeni government entity in the past three decades, the political wing of the Houthi movement, Ansar Allah, unveiled a <span><a href="https://www.iscyemen.org/president-al-mashat-inaugurates-national-vision-for-building-modern-state-of-yemen/">comprehensive plan</a></span> to rebuild war-torn Yemen through a manifesto offering 175 goals to rebuild the nation into a modern, stable and democratic state by 2030.</p><p>The manifesto, officially called the National Vision, refutes long-echoed Saudi claims that the Houthis are simply violent rebels occupying Yemen’s capital and shows a flexing of political power that reaffirms the Houthis primary reason for mobilizing against the ousted government of Abdul Mansour-al Hadi: a desire to have competent government institutions that establish a Yemeni democracy and to make the country prosperous.</p><p>It’s also a sign that the Houthis are seeking to reestablish relationships with countries around the world, and ultimately reopen Yemen to foreign investment.</p><p>The incumbent president of the Supreme Political Council in Sana`a, Mahdi al-Mashat, who is also a senior member of the Ansar ِAllah political party, announced the implementation of the National Vision and confirmed that the government in Sana`a, known as the National Salvation Government of the Republic of Yemen, has officially adopted the new vision.</p><p>The National Vision also aims to remake Yemen into a regional power, while strengthening state institutions that have been destroyed during the war, all before the year 2030 and while the Saudi-Coalition continues its bombardment of the country.</p><p>Some of the critical areas addressed in the National Vision include raising the average life expectancy, improving social services, increasing the literacy rate, tackling corruption, and raising the percentage of women in the workforce to 30 percent by 2030. Today, women comprise a mere 6 percent of Yemen’s workforce.</p><p>The National Vision also strives to unite the country — currently splintered along political, secteratairan and tribal lines — by launching a comprehensive national reconciliation that addresses political solutions, governance, social construction, economic development, administrative development, justice, the rule of law, innovation, creativity, knowledge, scientific research, education, health, environment, defense, foreign policy, and national security.</p><p>Furthermore, it endeavors to tackle corruption in a country that currently ranks amongst the worst in the world on the World Corruption Perceptions Index and achieves an annual real economic growth rate of less than 5 percent.</p><p>The 2030 goals set out by the National Vision are lofty, to say the least, especially for a country that has suffered immensely through four-years of a war </p><p>Yemen’s sustainable development index will improve from 45 to 60; its investment index will rise from 130 to 190; its annual per capita GDP will reach above $2,000; and its unemployment rate will be reduced to 10 percent. However, many political analysts who spoke to MintPress believe that Saudi Arabia will work to thwart the National Vision, as it emphasizes national sovereignty and independence, values that contradict Saudi Arabia’s vision of Yemen as a backyard to the kingdom – by Ahmed AbdulKareem</p><p><span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/houthi-movement-unveils-new-national-vision-heal-rebuild-modernize-yemen/258274/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/houthi-movement-unveils-new-national-vision-heal-rebuild-modernize-yemen/258274/</a></span></p><p>My remark: There already had been earlier reporting on this project.</p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Al-Houthi Calls on Diplomatic Missions to Resume Their Activities from Sanaa</p><p>Member of the Supreme Political Council, Mohammad Ali Al-Houthi, called on Arab and foreign diplomatic missions to return to its headquarters in the capital Sana'a, and resume its diplomatic activities instead of its current status and to carry out its activities outside Yemen.
