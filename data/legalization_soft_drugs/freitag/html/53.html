If they can’t fix it, it threatens to tear the country apart into even smaller warring pieces.</p><p>The two Gulf powerhouses have had clashing agendas.</p><p>Long contained, those agendas now risk unraveling the anti-Houthi alliance with bloody consequences on the ground.</p><p>THE NEW CIVIL WAR</p><p>One factor in the Saudi-UAE frictions came behind the scenes last year. Two senior Yemeni officials told The Associated Press that Saudi Arabia forced Hadi’s government to accept a U.N.-brokered truce that halted the UAE-backed militias’ offensive to retake Yemen’s most important port, Hodeida, from the Houthis.</p><p>Saudi Arabia feared the Red Sea port would be absorbed into the Emirates’ expanding zone of control along with other key southern ports it holds, the officials said. Like other officials, they spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicate relations between the government, the UAE and Saudis.</p><p>Hadi’s security agencies warned in an internal report obtained by the AP that as early as April they tracked STC preparations to launch a coup. The report said militia leaders met with Emirati officials over the plans.</p><p>In June, new Emirati shipments of armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition arrived in Aden for the militias, according to the officials. The Emiratis assured the government that the weapons were solely for the front lines against the Houthis.</p><p>“We were all fooled,” one official said.</p><p><span>Saudi Arabia rushed weapons and armored vehicles to Hadi’s forces and prevented the Emiratis from hitting them with airstrikes, according to local tribal leaders and two senior politicians.</span></p><p>WHAT’S NEXT</p><p>A stalemate has set in, as Saudi and Emirati officials hold discussions. The two governments have issued statements supporting unity and “legitimacy,” keeping at least a semblance of common ground.</p><p>Talks focus on forming a new Cabinet including the STC and other parties and a pull-back of forces. A sticking point is whether the militias would be integrated into Hadi’s forces or remain autonomous.</p><p>Hadi’s government says it won’t talk to the STC until it pulls out of Aden, and STC officials oppose joining a government with Islah. The STC on Thursday held the latest in a series of mass rallies in Aden’s streets to show popular support.</p><p>Both sides are building for renewed clashes – by Maggie Michael</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/b1eb5228527043059e40220834cc4b0d">https://apnews.com/b1eb5228527043059e40220834cc4b0d</a></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>Al-Jaber: Kingdom, UAE keen to achieve security and stability in Yemen</span></p><p>The Saudi Ambassador to Yemen Muhammad Al-Jaber said on Friday that the efforts of the Kingdom and the Emirates are the main pillar in ending the crisis in some of the governorates of southern Yemen.<br /> In a tweet, Al-Jaber confirmed that the Kingdom and the Coalition countries are focusing on achieving security and stability and supporting the legitimate government.<br /> He added: “The Kingdom appreciates the sacrifices and bravery of the sons of southern Yemen in confronting the Iran-backed Houthi militias in all fronts. The sons of southern Yemen, along with their brethren in all the Yemeni national forces are spearheading the fight against the evil Iranian scheme in Yemen.”<br /> He further said: “The Kingdom realizes the dimensions and complexities of the Southern Cause and its impact on the course of recent incidents in Aden, Abyan and Shabwah. We realize the difficulties the parties in the “Jeddah Dialogue” are facing and we value everybody’s keenness to engage in dialogue and avoid bloodshed”.</p><p><span><a

attempt to destabilize Yemen is a threat to its security and stability and the region, and will not hesitate to deal with it firmly.<br /> It also affirms its firm position that there is no alternative to the legitimate government in Yemen and that it does not accept any attempts to create a new reality in Yemen by using force or the threat of force.</p><p>The Kingdom also declares its readiness to extend a helping hand to those affected by this disorder and contribute to the treatment of the injured to alleviate their suffering based on its historical role towards the brotherly

interests of Yemeni state and the interests, security and stability, unity and territorial integrity of the people of Yemen, and to counter the coup of Al-Houthi terrorist militia and combat other terrorist organizations.</p><p><span><a

Yemen, one of a series of strategic missteps under the ambitious crown prince, analysts say.</p><p>The manoeuvres have rattled investors just as the kingdom seeks outside financing to pursue an ambitious reform programme to overhaul its oil-reliant economy.</p><p>"The Saudi foreign policy pattern is to 'shoot first and ask questions later'," Bessma Momani, a professor at Canada's University of Waterloo, told AFP.</p><p>"It is impulsive and fails to have a long-term exit strategy."</p><p>The kingdom appeared to temper its approach in the aftermath of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder by Saudi agents last October, with what many saw as the elevation of seasoned officials and the removal of younger aides in the prince's inner circle.</p><p>The murder left the prince's reputation as a reformer severely tarnished while also testing the kingdom's relations with its key ally Washington.</p><p>- Not fit for purpose -</p><p>But some observers have dismissed the notion of any substantial change while the prince still controls the main levers of power -- including the post of defence minister -- and pursues a domestic crackdown on dissenters and critics.</p><p>"There is a pattern of strategic errors by Saudi Arabia in recent years, and that's partly because the country is, for the first time, taking an independent leadership role in the region," said Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.</p><p>"Saudi Arabia was not prepared for the role... and the Saudi military was not designed for major international expeditions," he told AFP.</p><p>The

The nuclear deal and the immediate need to deescalate tensions in the Persian Gulf should just be the beginning—not the ultimate goal.

The author neglects that in Islamic countries a smaller or larger part of the population always will be “islamist” in a political sense and – if a there is democracy – would vote for “islamist” ideas and “islamist” parties. One example was the Egyptians’ vote for Mohammed Mursi from Muslim Brotherhood as president. If you promote democracy and free elections, you simply must accept this, even if you do not like it. And you must cooperate with such politicians in international politics.</p><p>In Yemen, the Houthis as wll as Islah Party dispose of a great number of supporters and would be important movement in any democratic state. Well, just see here how many Western politicians actually contempt democracy, if it does not fit to their ideas and interests.</p><p>Goulet just mixes all up and labels it as “Islamism”: The Houthis, Islah Party, Al Qaedah and ISIS. Neither Houthis nor Islah Party are “terrorists” in the real meaning of this word, unless you would misuse it as a biased battle cry. The international community, the West could live in coexistence with the Houthis and with Islah Party without having any larger problems.</p><p>But, and this is interesting: Goulet simply stays totally quiet about the real “mother of Islamism”, the force which is spreading aggressive Islamism worldwide, the force which had created the ideological base for jihadism which had morphed to the terrorism of Al Qaeda and ISIS: and this is Saudi Arabia. And even worse, she even pledges for support in favour of Saudi Arabia: “The international community should help the neighbors to secure the borders.”: This obviously refers to the Houthi-Saudi conflict at the Saudi border. This conflict is a consequence of Saudi interference in Yemen, flaring up again thanks to the Saudi bombing campaign which started on March 25, 2015. There is no problem at the Saudi southern border to Southern Yemen. Ands the only other neighbor of Yemen is Oman in the east – and there is no problem at all, apart from Saudi interference in Mahrah province, disturbing Omani interests!</p><p>Oh well, Goulet had proved to be an anti-Houthi and pro-Saudi partisan in Yemen conflict:</p><p><span><a href="https://www.euronews.com/2018/11/15/cutting-off-support-from-the-west-is-the-only-way-to-stop-yemen-s-terrorists-view">https://www.euronews.com/2018/11/15/cutting-off-support-from-the-west-is-the-only-way-to-stop-yemen-s-terrorists-view</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/international/416994-yemens-war-is-a-dangerous-proxy-in-irans-global-battle">https://thehill.com/opinion/international/416994-yemens-war-is-a-dangerous-proxy-in-irans-global-battle</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://actu.fr/politique/une-visite-parlementaires-francais-yemen-financee-partie-par-larabie-saoudite-fait-polemique_17178895.html">https://actu.fr/politique/une-visite-parlementaires-francais-yemen-financee-partie-par-larabie-saoudite-fait-polemique_17178895.html</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.lepoint.fr/politique/le-discret-voyage-de-six-parlementaires-francais-au-yemen-30-05-2018-2222748_20.php">https://www.lepoint.fr/politique/le-discret-voyage-de-six-parlementaires-francais-au-yemen-30-05-2018-2222748_20.php</a></span></p><p><span>(A P T)</span></p><p><span>US Embassy Yemen: </span><span>We congratulate <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hashtag_click">#Yemen</a> for becoming the 81st member of the global <a href="https://twitter.com/coalition">@Coalition</a> to Defeat <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ISIS?src=hashtag_click">#ISIS</a> as we work together to defeat Daesh, ending its ability to finance and perpetrate terrorist attacks and spread its toxic propaganda.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/USEmbassyYemen/status/1169647484307591168">https://twitter.com/USEmbassyYemen/status/1169647484307591168</a></span></p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p>US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Watches the Remnants of Iranian Weapons Used by Houthi Militia</p><p>Accompanied by US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Arabian Gulf Affairs Timothy Lenderking, US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker today visited the exhibit site of Iranian weapons smuggled and used by the Houthi terrorist militia in its hostile and terrorist acts against Saudi Arabia.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=1965945">https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=1965945</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Terror groups resurgent in Southern #Yemen</p><p>Disturbing reports have emerged over the past week of resurgent terrorist elements in Southern Yemen.

The party is the Muslim Brotherhood’s branch in Yemen and has made a considerable contribution towards destabilising the entire country.
