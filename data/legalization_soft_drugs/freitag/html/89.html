The unacceptably high rate of violations in Yemen highlights the urgent need for the Human Rights Council to create a Commission of Inquiry this September.</p><p>Mwatana’s annual report, <a href="http://mwatana.org/en/withering-life/">Withering Life: The Human Rights Situation in Yemen 2018, </a>is based on field research and investigations conducted by Mwatana for Human Rights. Mwatana conducted 2,065 interviews in Arabic with victims, relatives, eyewitnesses, and medical and humanitarian workers for the report.</p><p>Parties to the conflict gravely exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. Airstrikes and shelling killed and wounded civilians, and hit schools, hospitals, healthcare facilities, and medical personnel. The armed group Ansar Allah (Houthis), UAE proxy forces, Yemeni government forces disappeared, tortured and arbitrarily detained scores. Saudi Arabia detained and abused Yemeni fishermen inside Saudi Arabia. The Houthi armed group laid anti-personnel mines. Both sides recruited children. US drone strikes killed and wounded civilians. Incidents of sexual violence started to surface.</p><p>“The warring parties are undermining Yemeni civilian and civic life every day this war continues,” said Radhya Al Mutawakel, Chairperson of Mwatana for Human Rights. “Civilians are drowning in agony while states hesitate to take urgently needed action, like ending military support to warring parties and supporting accountability. Yemenis deserve a chance at life—and at peace—as much as anyone else.”</p><p>States cannot address the humanitarian crisis without addressing the human rights crisis, Mwatana said. Blocking, obstructing and impeding humanitarian aid and critical life-saving goods has a particularly acute impact, given the millions of civilians already living under the threat of famine. Mwatana documented 74 cases of obstructing humanitarian access and aid—with Ansar Allah (Houthis) responsible for the majority. Yemeni government and coalition forces also obstructed aid.</p><p>People’s ability to move freely inside and outside Yemen has decreased dramatically throughout the conflict. Security checkpoints—notably in Marib, Taizz, Al Bayda, Al Dhale and Lahj—occasionally discriminate based on travelers’ identity or financially exploit them, in a context where millions are already struggling to feed themselves and their families. The Saudi/UAE-led coalition still refuses to re-open Sanaa airport—nearly three years after shuttering it.</p><p>The failure to hold the Houthi armed group, the Saudi/UAE-led coalition and other armed actors accountable has meant that the same abuses Yemeni civilians suffered in the beginning of the conflict continue until this day. The Human Rights Council’s creation of the Group of Eminent Experts in 2017 was an important step towards accountability, but the gravity of the human rights and humanitarian crises in Yemen requires more to be done, including the creation of a Commission of Inquiry.</p><p>The Houthi armed group has laid antipersonnel and antivehicle landmines since the early days of the war. Mines have played a significant part in the battle for Yemen’s western coast and have gravely impacted civilians across the country. In 2018 alone, Mwatana documented 52 landmines cases, killing at least 60 civilians, including 8 women and 26 children, and wounding at least 51 others, including 12 women and 21 children.</p><p>Coalition airstrikes on civilians have not stopped. Mwatana documented about 150 coalition airstrikes in 11 governorates in 2018 that killed at least 375 civilians, including 165 children, and wounded 427 others, including 172 children. The attacks damaged private property and critical infrastructure, and struck residential neighborhoods, villages, roads, markets, commercial facilities, boats, and civilian vehicles.</p><p>Both the Houthi armed group and forces loyal to the coalition and Yemeni government continued to launch indiscriminate ground attacks, and to recruit children. The Houthi armed group was responsible for the vast majority of the 1,117 child recruitment cases Mwatana documented in 2018, but Saudi/UAE-led coalition forces and forces loyal to President Hadi also used children. Coalition proxy forces have been implicated in a range of abuses—from torture to sexual violence against kids. The US continued to carry out drone attacks in Yemen that killed and wounded civilians.</p><p>Arbitrary detentions, disappearances and torture, in some cases, leading to death, continued across the country. People have been detained and tried in court for their religious beliefs, and others have been detained because of their media work. While the majority of victims of detention-related abuses were men, women have also been detained, mistreated, and sentenced to death following unfair trials. States should prioritize pressuring the warring parties to release the arbitrarily detained, to resolve disappearances and to improve detention conditions, Mwatana said.</p><p>The space Yemenis had for expression, opposition, and voicing critical opinions before the conflict has been all but closed. States interested in rebuilding Yemen after the conflict should support civil society now, before it is destroyed, Mwatana said.</p><p>“The longer states wait to hold Saudi, Emirati, and Yemeni war criminals—on both the Houthi and Hadi sides—accountable, the more difficult it will be to rebuild Yemen,” Al Mutawakel said. “The virtual impunity that currently reigns emboldens the warring parties to keep carrying out awful abuses, destroying Yemen in the process.”</p><p><a

B K pH)</strong></p><p><strong>STATISTIC OF SANA’A LOSSES AS A RESULT OF COALITION’S BOMBING FOR MORE THAN FOUR YEARS</strong></p><p>Losses of Sanaa province as a result of Saudi-led aggression coalition’s bombing on service sectors and facilities over four year has amounted to more than 1.5 billion dollars, according to a report issued by the local authority in the province.</p><p>The report pointed out that the aggression coalition targeted bridges, institutes, schools, roads, health facilities, markets, private establishments, mosques, tourist and archaeological sites, farms, wells, electric stations, telecommunication towers and sheep and poultry farms.</p><p>According to the report, the coalition airstrikes destroyed and damaged 1,392 houses and governmental and commercial establishments in the center of the province and districts, including 171 houses were targeted directly and 682 houses were damaged partly, and 146 government facilities, historic sites, mosques and telecommunication towers and networks were completely and partially destroyed, as well as damage to 122 other facilities, at an initial cost of $ 1.5 billion.</p><p>The government installations that were destroyed completely and partially by the aggression included 12 schools, three health facilities, 61 bridges and roads, 12 mosques, seven historic sites, six tourist sites, 12 telecommunications towers, five centrals, seven technical and educational institutes and colleges, six government complexes and facilities, two power plants, stores and ambulance cars.</p><p>The report added that 15 health facilities, foremost of which is the 48 Model Medical Complex, 16 mosques, and 88 educational and academic institutions and schools, including the 21 September University and three colleges and institutes.</p><p>The aggression warplanes targeted the industrial sector in the province, causing the destruction of nine factories and commercial companies registered in the Chamber of Commerce in the province with branches in other areas and poultry farms, as well as damage to nine commercial establishments.</p><p>The report pointed out that hundreds of hectares of agricultural land known for growing “grapes, fruits, vegetables, coffee, mangoes and bananas” have been affected by the blockade imposed by the aggression coalition, because farmers were unable to irrigate them as a result of the severe shortage of diesel.</p><p>The agricultural sector in Sanaa was directly affected by the destruction of several agricultural buildings, dozens of wells with its artesian pumps and dozens of agricultural equipment and machinery.</p><p>The aggression caused the death of more than 380 head of cattle and more than 18,500 sheep and goats and more than 50 thousand poultry.</p><p>In the electricity sector, the report noted that the aggression caused damage to high-pressure networks “11 K.F” linking between the province’s districts and a low-pressure network and its cables, and burned the distribution transformers of different capacity.</p><p>The damage caused by the aggression in the telecommunications sector included the burning and disruption of dozens of ground and aeronautical cables of various capacities and stoppage of a number of ipwll and microwave stations in a number of districts, as well as the stoppage of the centrals and service permanently.</p><p>The report affirmed that the aggression coalition targeted the government complexes and facilities in the provinces, most notably the government complexes in the districts of Bilad al-Ross, Sanhan, Bani Bahlul, Hamdan, Arhab, and Bani Matar, and Walan’s agricultural compound, as well as the technical institutes in Hamdan, Jahana, Manakha and Bani Matar.</p><p><span><a

B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Emirati pullout: A new chapter of the war in western Yemen?</strong></p><p>The UAE is withdrawing troops from the western coast of Yemen - but supportive Yemeni fighters have stepped in to replace them</p><p>The recent announcement came as a spokesperson in Abu Dhabi told reporters that the country was shifting from a "military-first strategy" to a "peace-first strategy" in Yemen.</p><p>But Yemenis who spoke to Middle East Eye seemed to believe the move may have been more motivated by a lack of civilian support and power struggles between militias that could further degenerate now that the UAE is on its way out.</p><p>After the Saudi-led coalition took the areas of Mocha, Khokha and others on the western coast in early 2017, the UAE became the de facto ruling power in the region, spanning between the Hodeidah and Taiz provinces.</p><p>The Emirates trained Yemeni forces in the western coast under the name of al-Amaliqa, as well as fighters loyal to <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/killer-or-hero-nephew-former-yemeni-president-divides-taiz">Tareq Saleh</a></span>, the nephew of former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh.</p><p>Both groups joined forces in western Yemen under the name "Guards of the Republic" and stood with the UAE.</p><p>The recent Emirati decision to scale down its presence on the western coast is tied to the increased role of these friendly Yemeni forces.</p><p>“The leadership of the Emirati forces in Yemen decided to reduce the number of Emirati fighters on the western coast and they vacated a camp in Khokha, but that does not mean they have withdrawn from the battle,” a source in the Amaliqa forces in Mocha confirmed to MEE. </p><p>“Emirati forces trained Yemeni forces and we are fighting on the ground under the supervision of Emirati officers on the western coast and in Aden.”</p><p>The source said he believed the UAE should have scaled down its presence in western Yemen at least a year ago, arguing that pro-Hadi Yemeni forces were adequately trained and equipped to fight and defend the western coast from the Houthis.</p><p>“It is irrational that Emirati soldiers fight on the frontlines while Yemenis do not. We can defend our land and we only need some instruction and suggestions from Emirati military experts,” he added.</p><p>“The Houthis tried to attack us, but we could handle all attacks alone without help from Emirati forces,” the Amaliqa source said. “The recent attacks by the Houthis confirmed that [pro-Hadi] Yemeni forces are qualified enough to lead the battles alone against the Houthis.”</p><p>Long-distance control</p><p>While Emirati soldiers may be leaving the western coast, Yemeni residents believe that the small Gulf country remains the main power in control of the area.</p><p>“We cannot see Emirati fighters in the streets, but we can see their flags on public institutions and every day we face Yemeni forces on the ground who are worse than the Emiratis,” Ali, a resident of Mocha, told MEE.</p><p>“Emirati forces think we will believe that Yemenis have taken control of the western coast,” Ali added. “But all of us know that Emirati forces withdrew after placing their hands [pro-Hadi Yemeni forces] along the western coast.”</p><p>Many residents of the area have little love for the UAE, especially after Emirati forces <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/life-was-better-under-houthis-mochas-fishermen-bewail-uae-liberation">barred fishermen from sailing</a></span> or fishing off the coast earlier this year.</p><p>“The Emirates are looting our wealth while our children starve to death,” Ali said. “Emiratis still control the western coast and most of the southern provinces from a distance, and no one can oppose it.”</p><p>Meanwhile, seasoned Taiz-based journalist Mohammed Ali told MEE that the UAE withdrawal could be tied to growing tensions between southern separatist forces and Tareq Saleh’s fighters in the west.</p><p>“Southern forces backed by the UAE used to be the main power on the western coast, but President Hadi sent Tareq’s forces last year to the same areas,” Ali told MEE.</p><p>“Southern forces did not welcome Tareq’s forces and vice versa. While both support the UAE, it was difficult for the UAE to remain on the western coast.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/emirati-pullout-new-chapter-war-western-yemen">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/emirati-pullout-new-chapter-war-western-yemen</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia May Be on Its Own in Yemen</strong></p><p>But now this alliance is experiencing some challenges as the UAE has decided to pull at least part of its military contingent in Yemen out of the country. On the one hand, the Emirati move highlights serious problems in the continuing intervention there, pursued by the UAE and Saudi Arabia since March 2015. On the other hand, it points to differences in how the two countries perceive their four-year joint endeavor, one that they have considered pivotal in preventing a future Iranian sphere of influence in the Arabian Peninsula. These two considerations take on special significance today as the war appears stalemated and the Houthis seem to insist on bringing it to targets in Saudi Arabia itself, both military and civilian, and on occasion to the UAE.</p><p>Considering the serious Houthi challenge on the border with Saudi Arabia, the UAE action cannot be a positive development for Saudi Arabia. In fact, Saudi officials are <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/world/middleeast/yemen-emirates-saudi-war.html">reported</a></span> to have been disappointed and had “intervened with the Emirati leaders to try to dissuade them from the drawdown.”</p><p>Additionally, withdrawing from Yemen’s south exposes many of the militias the UAE nurtured and opens the possibility of competition and conflict among them. The Emirati intervention and conquest of Aden and other areas gave sustenance to the southern secessionists whose efforts had been stymied before. Today’s Southern Transitional Council—led by former Governor of Aden Aidarous al-Zubaidi, who was sacked by President Mansour Hadi in 2017—has for all practical purposes taken over government functions in Aden and plans for <span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-south-north-war-conflict-violence-land-split-houthi-coalition-aden-stc-a8695931.html">self-determination</a></span>. The UAE also <span><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/76876">supported militias</a></span> like the Security Belt Forces and the Shabwani and Hadrami Elite Forces, all nominally part of the Yemeni Army, as well as the Salafi Amaliqa and Abu al-Abbas Brigades in addition to elements of the former People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY)</p><p>The UAE’s role in Yemen and its support for militias caused much consternation among the members of President Hadi’s government who considered the UAE’s actions an infringement on Yemeni sovereignty and a challenge to the president’s legitimacy. </p><p>This overall picture of UAE work in Yemen thus makes Abu Dhabi’s decision to withdraw from Yemen an intriguing development. Important reasons must have necessitated it, given the significance of the Saudi-Emirati relationship and the level of investment the UAE has made in the war effort. These reasons include the following</p><p>The Saudi Position</p><p>One thing is sure after the UAE’s decision: Saudi Arabia is in a bind. It cannot pursue an endless engagement in Yemen without reliable partners with military means like the UAE, and it cannot simply pack up and leave because that would amount to a strategic defeat that ensconces the Houthis in northern Yemen and in complete, unchallenged control. In essence, Saudi Arabia today may be rethinking the relationship <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/world/middleeast/crown-prince-mohammed-bin-zayed.html">that developed</a></span> between its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the UAE’s Mohammed bin Zayed as the influencer and supporter. Hard questions will emerge about this relationship, the value of the Saudi-Emirati alliance in Yemen, Saudi Arabia’s ability to cooperate with the UAE’s friends in south Yemen, and several other issues on which the two countries have cooperated before.</p><p>Be that as it may, the Saudi redeployment to areas vacated by the UAE in the southwest may arguably be a strategically necessary step pending other military or diplomatic developments. What is most important from a Saudi national security perspective is to ensure the security of southern Saudi Arabia from Houthi incursions and prevent the repeated and embarrassing Houthi drone strikes against Saudi installations</p><p>The UAE move in Yemen will spread Saudi forces too thin for comfort.</p><p>Saudi Arabia’s leaders would do well to step back from the headlong policies of the past regarding interfering in Yemen’s affairs, even if these represent a serious national security concern.</p><p>Saudi Arabia could also help its position in Yemen and the Gulf if it agreed to participate in a region-wide initiative for peace and security that includes all members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Yemen, Iraq, and Iran. – by Imad K. Harb</p><p><span><a href="http://arabcenterdc.org/policy_analyses/saudi-arabia-may-be-on-its-own-in-yemen/">http://arabcenterdc.org/policy_analyses/saudi-arabia-may-be-on-its-own-in-yemen/</a></span><span> = <a href="https://lobelog.com/saudi-arabia-may-be-on-its-own-in-yemen/">https://lobelog.com/saudi-arabia-may-be-on-its-own-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>OPINION - UAE's Yemen withdrawal: Cover for continued clout?</strong></p><p>Rising unpopularity of UAE’s military presence in southern Yemen explains shift towards more indirect power projection</p><p>Although these factors contributed to the UAE’s policy shift in Yemen, the UAE’s decision to scale back its military intervention in Yemen was also triggered by international pressure and a desire to suspend a protracted military campaign. In spite of U.S. President Donald Trump’s close relationship with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, the U.S. Department of Defense recently pressured the UAE to allow an investigation into the abuse of detainees in Yemen. Backlash against the UAE’s alleged arms shipments to al-Qaeda in Yemen and criticisms of the UAE’s role in worsening Yemen’s humanitarian crisis have also damaged the UAE’s international reputation. As the UAE’s geopolitical vision depends on blending hard and soft power, Abu Dhabi’s withdrawal announcement was aimed, in part, at salvaging the UAE’s tarnished reputation.</p><p>As the Yemeni civil war drags on, UAE officials have also faced internal pressure to demonstrate that their involvement in Yemen is finite. Reservations about the sustainability of the UAE’s military intervention first surfaced in official circles during the early stages of the conflict.</p><p>Even though the UAE is downsizing its military presence, Abu Dhabi does not wish to surrender its influence in Yemen. To preserve its favorable strategic position, the UAE will selectively engage in counter-terrorism operations in Yemen, assist its proxies in their efforts to consolidate hegemony over southern Yemen, and expand its diplomatic involvement in Yemen. These actions will help ensure that UAE-Saudi Arabia relations are not severely damaged by Abu Dhabi’s unilateral withdrawal and that the UAE will secure its interests in an eventual Yemeni peace settlement.</p><p>In spite of the UAE’s troop drawdown from Yemen, initial reports suggest that Abu Dhabi will maintain a military presence in its base on al-Mukalla, a former al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) stronghold that was overrun by the UAE in 2016.</p><p>As Abu Dhabi’s hegemony over Aden complements its rising military presence on the Red Sea and Horn of Africa, the UAE will ensure that its troop drawdown does not weaken its influence in southern Yemen. The Security Belt, a UAE-aligned south Yemeni paramilitary force, continues to maintain a formidable military presence throughout southern Yemen. The UAE has also reportedly directed the STC to establish a parallel army to the Hadi-controlled Yemeni military. Once this process is complete, the STC’s military force will consist of an estimated 52,000 south Yemeni troops and sizable numbers of Emirati technical advisors. This level of military strength effectively prevents pro-Hadi or Houthi forces from expelling the UAE’s proxies through military force.</p><p>In order to repair its tarnished image and further its geopolitical agenda, the UAE will likely expand its involvement in the diplomatic resolution of the Yemeni civil war.</p><p>Even though many international media outlets have conflated the UAE’s troop reductions in Yemen with a military withdrawal, the UAE remains firmly committed to advancing its strategic interests in Yemen. The UAE is likely to preserve its hegemony over southern Yemen and could exert considerable influence over Yemen’s future political trajectory. Even if these successes are achieved, however, Mohammed bin Zayed will struggle to distance the UAE from its instrumental role in bringing about Yemen’s humanitarian catastrophe – by Samuel Ramani</p><p><a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/analysis/opinion-uaes-yemen-withdrawal-cover-for-continued-clout/1533034">https://www.aa.com.tr/en/analysis/opinion-uaes-yemen-withdrawal-cover-for-continued-clout/1533034</a></p><p><span>My remark: More on this topic in cp2.</span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>NTF Releases Monthly Report on General Situation in Yemen</strong></p><p>The National Team for Foreign Outreach (NTF), a humanitarian NGO operating in Yemen, released a periodical report on the general situation in the war-torn country in the month of April 2019 compared to the Aprils of the past 4 years.</p><p>"Siege of the city of Durayhimi by the countries led by Saudi Arabia resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians.

The cosmopolitan genotype of dengue virus type 2 was most common; viruses appeared to have originated in Saudi Arabia. Damage to public health infrastructure during the ongoing civil war might enable dengue to become endemic to Yemen.</p><p>The association between wars and dengue virus (DENV) transmission has been well-recognized. During World War II (1939–1945), extensive ecologic disruption and demographic changes created an abundance of ideal breeding sites for <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes, as well as pools of susceptible military personnel and displaced populations to support the spread of dengue (<em><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/7/18-0046_article#r1">1</a></em>).</p><p>In 2015, a total of <span>&gt;</span>6,777 suspected dengue cases were recorded in Yemen, which suggested that the country was experiencing an unprecedented increase in the number of dengue cases (<em><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/7/18-0046_article#r7">7</a></em>). Taiz, a governorate in southwestern Yemen, experienced fierce fighting related to the civil war (<em><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/7/18-0046_article#r5">5</a></em>). An extreme spike in dengue cases was recorded in this governorate beginning in August 2015, soon after the start of the war.</p><p>Dengue is emerging to be a serious mosquitoborne disease in war-torn Yemen. Its presence among 51% of febrile patients suspected to have dengue is almost comparable to the percentage reported in dengue-endemic countries of Southeast Asia. It is expected that the public health problems associated with dengue will worsen during the continuing civil war in Yemen.</p><p><span><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/7/18-0046_article">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/7/18-0046_article</a></span></p><p>(* B H)</p><p>EPIDEMICS ALSO KILL YEMENIS ALL OVER ITS PROVINCES</p><p>A new epidemic had hit many citizens during the past few days in the port city of Aden, southern Yemen, a medical source reported.</p><p>“A strange skin epidemic, which may be (scabies), causes a state of hysterical itching in patients and increases in the evening,” Crater news website quoted the medical source as saying.</p><p>The epidemic has hit hundreds of people in different parts of Aden, specifically the Crater area, where it spreads very quickly among citizens without any action by the Ministry of Health to contain it, the source added.</p><p>He pointed out that pharmacies exploited citizens with this disease and sold a fat substance used for body, claiming that it treats itching, for 1300 riyals a bag, taking advantage of the absence of government control.</p><p>This comes in light of the absence of health control, and amid security, chaos witnessed by Aden and the southern provinces due to the presence of the Saudi-Emirati occupation.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/epidemics-also-kill-yemenis-all-over-its-provinces/">https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/epidemics-also-kill-yemenis-all-over-its-provinces/</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1b Am wichtigsten: Kampf um Hodeidah / Most important: Hodeidah battle</span></h2><p><span>Siehe / Look at cp7</span></p><p>(* A P)</p><p>U.N. says Yemeni warring sides agree port ceasefire moves</p><p>Yemen’s warring parties have agreed new measures to enforce a ceasefire and facilitate a troop pullback from the flashpoint port of Hodeidah, the United Nations said on Monday.</p><p>Representatives of the Iran-aligned Houthi movement and the Saudi-backed Yemeni government met on a U.N. ship in the Red Sea for talks on Sunday and Monday, a U.N. statement said.</p><p>The U.N. statement said both sides were keen to reduce hostilities after a rise in ceasefire violations at Hodeidah.</p><p>“They agreed on a mechanism and new measures to reinforce the ceasefire and de-escalation, to be put in place as soon as possible,” it said, without giving more details.</p><p>The two sides met as members of the “Redeployment Coordination Committee”, a body set up by the United Nations and chaired by Danish Lieutenant General Michael Lollesgaard to oversee the ceasefire and troop exit.</p><p>The committee finalised conceptual agreement on troop withdrawals, which now required political leaders’ buy-in, the statement said.

Those sentenced to death also included Nasr al-Salami, who works for the Yemeni Islamic Bank, among others.</p><p>The Houthis said the convicted figures had been involved in terrorist activities after receiving training at one of the camps in Yemen. The militia also accused these figures of being financed by some states, even as it could not present proof of this.</p><p>Relations between al-Islah and the Houthis were secret at first, given the illegitimate nature of the Houthis’ presence at Yemen’s saddle.</p><p>Relations between the two sides started to come to the fore when Gen.

Die Häfen in und bei Hodeidah können nicht mehr von den Huthis für Waffenschmuggel benützt werden. Das erlaubt Abu Dhabi, seine Strategie von "Militär zuerst" in "Frieden zuerst" umzuformulieren.</p><p>Die Realität ist etwas prosaischer: Die VAE haben im Jemen etwa 50.000 Jemeniten trainiert und ausgerüstet, die nun die emiratischen Agenden übernehmen.</p><p>Hier unterscheiden sich schon des Längeren die Interessen der VAE und Saudi-Arabiens.

The onslaught against the Yemenis has attracted condemnation from various quarters around the world, it has been a public relations disaster for UAE.</p><p>The <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190628-uae-scales-down-military-presence-in-yemen/">withdrawal</a></span> from the coalition will leave Saudi Arabia extremely vulnerable and certainly impact on funding of the war. </p><p>Besides the criticism of those leading the unwinnable war in Yemen, there are other reasons why the UAE withdrew from the coalition. First, according to Jacqulyn Meyer Kantack, a researcher from the Critical Threat Project: “The UAE reportedly <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190708-uae-troop-drawdown-in-yemen-was-agreed-with-saudi-arabia/">warned</a></span> Saudi Arabia to abandon its support for Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi or the UAE will abandon the coalition.”</p><p>“Relations between the two states are strained by a combination of UAE skepticism toward prospects of a military victory and the UAE’s aversion to political Islamists in the north.”</p><p>Second, the UAE’s political and economic relations with Iran continue, albeit not as smoothly as they were in the past. </p><p>Third, Gulf waters are rapidly getting crowded, talks of a <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190710-us-wants-military-coalition-to-safeguard-waters-off-iran-yemen/">“policing force”</a></span> in the Strait of Hormuz are gaining momentum. The UAE therefore wants to be part of the force together with the US and the UK, amongst others, for two reasons.</p><p>In withdrawing its forces from Yemen, the UAE is saving itself from the humiliation that will come with the coalition’s defeat. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman will eventually be left alone to deal with the humiliation of defeat at the hands of the Houthis.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190715-saudi-arabias-dilemma-as-the-uae-pulls-out-of-yemen/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190715-saudi-arabias-dilemma-as-the-uae-pulls-out-of-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p><span>Emirates Plans To Rely On Militias After Withdrawing Its Troops From Yemen</span></p><p>The United Arab Emirates began relying on armed militias in Yemen after withdrawing troops from the country, which has been waging a criminal war for several years.</p><p>Hundreds of recruits from the Transitional Council were transferred for training outside Yemen.</p><p>The recruits were transported from Yemen via the sea and flights from Aden, without disclosing who had been transferred to the conscripts who would undergo military training.</p><p>Reuters quoted a senior UAE official saying they were not worried about a military vacuum in Yemen, in the time Abu Dhabi’s recruited about 90,000 Yemeni troops.</p><p>The Yemeni political researcher Abdul Baki Shamsan said that the UAE’s transfer of hundreds of recruits for training is part of its strategy of media exit, not military, from Yemen. Some sectors of the UAE military were transferred but the funding of forces affiliated to it remains in a complete absence of the legitimate authority.</p><p>He added that the UAE has managed through these militias and its affiliates to tighten control of southern Yemen and that the benefit of its announcement of withdrawal from is easing international pressure without losing the advantages of presence, control, and influence exercised by its groups and militias.</p><p>On the other hand, the Yemeni writer, Nabil Bakiri, said that Abu Dhabi has already trained thousands of individuals, and what is happening now may be a new polarization of hundreds of elements that were previously working within the national army, and was merged and polarized as a result of the imbalance at the level of state and the interruption and weak salaries.</p><p>In parallel, a report by the Guardian newspaper said that the UAE will hand over its positions in Yemen to foreign mercenaries and local militias loyal to the UAE and not subject to the legitimate authority of the Yemeni government.</p><p>The sources confirmed that the plan of the UAE regime is to conduct a proxy war in Yemen through its militias and foreign mercenaries, allowing Abu Dhabi to manage operations from outside the picture and allow the continuation of military supplies and the removal of the UAE from the forefront.</p><p><span><a href="http://emiratesleaks.com/en/emirates-plans-rely-militias-withdrawing-troops-yemen/">http://emiratesleaks.com/en/emirates-plans-rely-militias-withdrawing-troops-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>UAE drawdown scrambles the board in Yemen</p><p>Local Yemeni reactions to the UAE decision are mixed, confused, and blurred. Although Islah and the Yemeni ruling elite siding with President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi have previously demanded a recalibration or end to the Emirati role, removing the UAE’s anti-missile defense system (i.e. Patriot) and heavy weapons have made local actors more susceptible to Houthi missiles, as was evident in Marib. This vulnerability, compounded by Abu Dhabi’s strong, informal ties with the approximately 90,000 UAE-trained Yemenis, might push the Yemeni elite to rethink things the hard way. The Government of Yemen (GoY) must assess its relations with coalition partners and clearly decide whether pursuing a policy of rapprochement or confrontation with Abu Dhabi will relax tensions and alter the present imbalance of power in liberated territories. Unsurprisingly, the Houthis view the UAE drawdown as a partial victory, hoping for a full-fledged withdrawal of the coalition.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/monday-briefing-us-and-turkey-face-s-400-confrontation#jalal">https://www.mei.edu/publications/monday-briefing-us-and-turkey-face-s-400-confrontation#jalal</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span>Why is the UAE Winding Down in Yemen?</p><p>The UAE is a military linchpin in Yemen.

"An upcoming United Nations (UN) report featuring a blacklist of child rights violators is expected to refrain from toughening criticism of the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen despite a bus bombing last year that killed scores of children," according to diplomats.</p><p>The coalition was put on the UN blacklist in 2016 and later removed after Saudi Arabia reacted furiously, threatening to cut funding to UN programs. To appease Riyadh, the United Nations split the list into two sections in 2017 and put the coalition on "Section B" – which highlights efforts by the Saudi-led group to avoid killing and maiming children in Yemen.</p><p>According to diplomats with knowledge of the report, Guterres has received a draft recommendation from his UN envoy who determined that the coalition should remain on the separate section of the list that recognizes measures taken to avoid targeting children. This recommendation comes after 40 children were killed in August last year when their bus was attacked in Sa'ada governorate. The coalition admitted that "mistakes" were made in targeting the school bus.</p><p><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=7850">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=7850</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp8 Saudi-Arabien / Saudi Arabia</span></h2><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Qatif?src=hash">#Qatif</a></span>: The Prosecution has demanded the death penalty against three activists from the "23 Wanted Men" list for participating in Qatif's pro-reform movement.

But what is the Riyad-Washington axis afraid of? The province of al-Charghiya and the cities of Hasa and Qatif are bordering on Bahrain, allied country of Saudi Arabia. But the deployment of US force took place in Hafar al-Batin, 70 kilometers from the Iraqi borders.The arrival of hundreds of US military seems, according to some sources, intended to counter any insurrection potentially able to turn into a revolt that will ignite the eastern Saudi before expanding to the rest of the kingdom. Widely put to the test by the war in Yemen, the Saudi army is calling for help from the United States.

In the north, deep inside Saudi territory itself, the Yemeni Armed Forces and Popular Committees are scoring significant victories across a broad front, liberating large swaths of Najran and Jizan from Saudi control. The word “liberating” is definitely applicable here, for although the two aforementioned provinces are officially part of the Saudi kingdom, they are a key part of Greater Yemen that were occupied by the Wahhabi hordes as recently as 1934, after being part of Yemen for millenia.</p><p><span><a href="https://nthnews.net/en/yemennews/saudi-war-on-yemen-the-victims-strike-back/">https://nthnews.net/en/yemennews/saudi-war-on-yemen-the-victims-strike-back/</a> = </span><a href="https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/saudi-war-on-yemen-the-victims-strike-back/">https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/saudi-war-on-yemen-the-victims-strike-back/</a></p><p>My comment: Here, a piece of pro-Houthi propaganda.</p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Mohamed bin Zayed reiterates UAE's commitment to peace, security and stability in Yemen</p><p>His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, underscored that preserving Yemen's security and stability and supporting its people were part of the established pillars of the UAE policy since the time of the late founding father, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.</p><p>His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed said Yemen is of strategic importance with regard to Arab security.</p><p>He made these remarks while receiving Sultan Al Burkani, Speaker of the Yemeni Parliament, at Al Bahr Palace on Monday.

This is a significant step, as the country seeks to shift from a “military-first strategy to a peace-first strategy”, according to a UAE official. Rightly, this decision has received ample attention, but many have missed the integral point: the plan of the Saudi-led Arab coalition was always to stabilise Yemen, come to a political solution and have Yemenis oversee their own security. The UAE redeployment is not a divergence from the original aspirations of the coalition, rather a move that has been waiting for the right moment. And although the decision was reached in agreement with the UAE’s allies in the Arab Coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, there has been much speculation about its meaning. Some have gone so far as to say it signifies a split in the Coalition, with rumours about UAE-Saudi relations.</p><p>The reality is that the redeployment of Emirati troops comes after in-depth discussions that have been playing out for the past year between the UAE and its coalition partners. Since the beginning of their involvement in the conflict, the UAE and the Arab coalition have been deeply committed to finding a solution and restoring Yemen’s internationally recognised government, led by President Abdrabu Mansur Hadi, as mandated by the United Nations Security Council. This end goal remains unchanged. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/editorial/troop-redeployment-in-yemen-marks-an-important-step-towards-peace-1.886595">https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/editorial/troop-redeployment-in-yemen-marks-an-important-step-towards-peace-1.886595</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Dubai soll zum weltweit freundlichsten Ort für Menschen der Entschlossenheit" werden</p><p>Dubais erfolgreiches Entwicklungsmodell, das es in den letzten Jahrzehnten zu einer der bekanntesten Städte der Welt gemacht hat, hatte immer integratives Wachstum und soziales Wohlbefinden im Mittelpunkt.
