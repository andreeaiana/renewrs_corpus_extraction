After a year of trying, DW correspondent Fanny Facsar was granted a visa. On her journey, she witnessed a deeply torn country devastated by a conflict that has been all but forgotten</p><p>Working as a journalist in a country where political alliances are this fluid is dangerous, especially as a foreigner. For this reason – and not just because I am woman in a deeply conservative country – it was necessary to conceal my identity by wearing <a href="https://en.qantara.de/dossier/the-dispute-over-head-scarves">a full veil.</a> But as a woman in such a conservative society, one is sometimes granted access to parts of life off-limits to men. This is something I experienced while conducting research during a reporting trip in Saudi Arabia last year.</p><p>My journey took me to many different regions of Yemen. In some places, people can still afford to buy food in supermarkets, while in others, many people are incredibly desperate. At a local market, for example, an older woman vented her anger, shouting: "I have only got two fish for seven people. What are we supposed to eat?" At the same time, there are also regions in the country <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/into-the-unknown-african-migrants-in-yemen/a-49898774">where African migrants, who know very little about the prolonged Yemen conflict, trek through the desert by the hundreds</a> hoping to reach Saudi Arabia.</p><p>I met people who, despite the widespread misery, are keen to preserve and foster the country's cultural life. They dream of going to cinemas and watching theatre. They are not only aghast that people are dying of hunger, but also appalled that their people lack culture to nourish their souls.</p><p>Several days after I left the country, a suicide bomber struck a police station near the hospital where we filmed. </p><p><a href="https://en.qantara.de/content/conflict-in-the-gulf-covering-yemens-forgotten-war">https://en.qantara.de/content/conflict-in-the-gulf-covering-yemens-forgotten-war</a></p><p>(* B K P)</p><p>Its Lifeblood Attacked, What Are Saudi Arabia’s Options Now?</p><p>What are Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s options and which is he likely to deploy?</p><p><span>Bigger Military Involvement in Yemen:</span></p><p>Saudi Arabia hasn’t blamed anyone for the attack, but hours after the raid, Saudi fighter jets pounded Houthi militia positions in the northern Yemeni provinces of Saada and Al Jawf. </p><p><span>Cyber attacks and covert operations:</span></p><p>Covert operations and cyber warfare will be the most likely response in the short term, said Ryan Bohl, a Middle East analyst at Stratfor.

In a call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman on Saturday, United States President Donald Trump offered support for Saudi self-defense. </p><p>Regardless where the attack originated, Iran remains the shadow culprit. The attack on the Aramco oil facilities will likely set the peace negotiations between the Arab Coalition and the Houthis back and further escalate the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran. While the US remains committed to Saudi security, the Trump administration does not seem willing to retaliate on behalf of Riyadh. Instead, the White House has provided strong political support and military aid to Saudi forces to take matters into their own hands.</p><p><a href="https://t-intell.com/2019/09/15/saudis-to-retaliate-after-iranian-backed-drone-attack/">https://t-intell.com/2019/09/15/saudis-to-retaliate-after-iranian-backed-drone-attack/</a></p><p>(* B K P)</p><p>Attack on Saudi Oil Facilities: The War Is in Yemen, the Solution Is in Washington</p><p>This is no longer a local conflict that developed into a proxy war; it is an international struggle for prestige and influence in a country that is very similar to Afghanistan</p><p>The massive attack by Houthis from Yemen on oil installations in Saudi Arabia was described by the Houthis as “the second balance of deterrence.”</p><p>This success will apparently fuel their desire to continue attacking Saudi targets 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) away, using drones supplied by Iran. Their hope is that the Saudis will follow in the UAE’s footsteps and stop their attacks on Houthi targets while handing the Houthis a position of power in the negotiations that will eventually lead to a diplomatic solution.</p><p>Driving a wedge between <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-saudi-arabia-1.5599258">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-united-arab-emirates-1.6173789">the UAE</a> has effectively dismantled the “Arab coalition” that Saudi Arabia formed in 2015 to halt Iranian influence<a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-yemen-1.5599311"> in Yemen</a>. </p><p>The recognition that there is no military solution to the war in Yemen – despite the superior military capabilities of Saudi Arabia’s and the UAE – along with President Donald Trump’s efforts to open direct talks with Iranian President Hassan Rohani, have spurred the U.S. administration to again try to negotiate with the Houthis, this time directly rather than through mediators.</p><p>Qassem stated that Iran was always in favor of a political solution in Yemen and that “if the parties reach an agreement, the agreement could expand and include all the parties involved and with influence.” In other words, this would lead to improved relations between the Gulf states and Iran</p><p>A diplomatic solution cannot be merely a cease-fire or a withdrawal of forces. It requires a political and economic road map for the postwar period. The distribution of political power and an equitable budget allocation, two issues that have served over the years as grounds for the war between the Houthis and the Yemeni government</p><p>Despite the internal disagreements among their leaders, the Houthis understand that the burden of rehabilitating Yemen will fall on Saudi Arabia and Gulf states and not Iran.</p><p>The Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb strait are not the Persian Gulf and <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/strait-of-hormuz-what-happens-if-the-world-s-key-oil-artery-gets-blocked-1.7226823">the Strait of Hormuz</a>, in terms of trade volume or the quantities of oil flowing through them. Moreover, Yemen is surrounded by powerful entities such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Navy, as well Israel, at a distance. They can guarantee free passage through the Red Sea without the conquest of Yemen even if Yemen ends up under Houthi leadership.</p><p>The concern is that Iran would increase its military presence in Yemen particularly along the coasts. But unlike Lebanon and Syria, for Iran to maintain army or naval forces far from its ports in the Persian Gulf is contrary to the strategy that it has adopted so far.</p><p>It is doubtful that the Houthis will be willing to fight for Iran or any other country once an agreement is reached on their stake in the regime, which is expected to be significant. It appears that, for all the parties, the war in Yemen has reached a stage that provides relatively good prospects for a diplomatic solution that would end the terrible human tragedy there – by Zvi Bar‘el</p><p><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-attack-on-saudi-oil-facilities-the-war-is-in-yemen-the-solution-is-in-washington-1.7844419">https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-attack-on-saudi-oil-facilities-the-war-is-in-yemen-the-solution-is-in-washington-1.7844419</a></p><p>My comment: A thoughtful article, from Israel. But it must be said that the role oft he Iranian bogeyman is overrated.</p><p>(* B P)</p><p>Who’s the Terrorist Now — MBS or the Houthis?</p><p>MBS, the man who undoubtedly ordered the kidnapping, murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, has imprisoned and tortured Saudi citizens, has victimized the 12 percent of Saudis who belong to the Shia sect of Islam, has plundered the state treasury to finance the lavish lifestyle of his tribe and who has relentlessly bombed dissident Yemeni Houthis and their civilian families for over four years, now condemns the Houthis and their Iranian backers as terrorists. The horrors of Saudi war crimes, with military support of the United Arab Emirates, intelligence and mid-air refueling supplied by the United States and sophisticated military hardware bought from the United States, the United Kingdom and France have been well documented by the United Nations.</p><p>All the while, the Trump Administration has given its wholehearted support to this same MBS. And on September 14, Secretary of State Pompeo has took his wholehearted support of MBS one step further by attributing the attack on Saudi oil facilities to Iran. The Trump Administration’s hubris and sanctimonious lectures on who is and who is not a terrorist and on the sanctity of human rights will fall on deaf ears. The Trump Administration should well remember that a country is judged by what it does and who it supports, not by what it tweets.</p><p><a href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/150057/Who-s-the-Terrorist-Now-MBS-or-the-Houthis">https://en.mehrnews.com/news/150057/Who-s-the-Terrorist-Now-MBS-or-the-Houthis</a></p><p><span>(A B K P)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span>Riyadh must end attacks on Yemen or face consequences: Analyst</p><p>Political Commentator Hussein al-Bukhaiti believes Ansarullah forces are sending a message to Saudi Arabia to either halt their attacks on Yemen or face its consequences.</p><p><a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/09/14/606173/Yemen-Saudi-Arabia-Ansarullah-attacks">https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/09/14/606173/Yemen-Saudi-Arabia-Ansarullah-attacks</a></p><p><span>(B P)</span></p><p><span>In violation of basic journalistic standards </span><a href="https://twitter.com/NPRnewsdesk"><span>@NPRnewsdesk</span></a><span> says “Iranian-backed Huthis” But fo not ssy </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/US?src=hashtag_click"><span>#US</span></a><span>-backed </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Saudis?src=hashtag_click"><span>#Saudis</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/AliAlAhmed_en/status/1172964359255089160">https://twitter.com/AliAlAhmed_en/status/1172964359255089160</a></p><p><span>(B K P)</span></p><p>Yemen, pounded by war for five years</p><p>Impoverished Yemen has been mired in a devastating conflict since Iran-backed rebels seized the capital Sanaa five years ago.</p><p>The war escalated in 2015 when a Saudi-led military coalition intervened in support of the embattled government, although Sanaa remains in rebel control.</p><p><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20190810-yemen-pounded-war-five-years">https://www.france24.com/en/20190810-yemen-pounded-war-five-years</a></p><p>My comment: This is too short, and you will not understand much.</p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Saudis Vulnerable to Yemeni Houthi Attacks</p><p>There's nothing civil about war in Yemen.

I’m not sure that it’s clear that we’re not talking about people “in the line of fire,” or people “engaged in a war”; it’s important to understand that it’s civilians that are bearing the brunt of this conflict, right?</p><p>Yeah, absolutely. As a result of the Saudi/UAE <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/world/middleeast/yemen-emirates-saudi-war.html">blockade</a> around Yemen, we see 14 million people living on the brink of <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/14-million-people-on-brink-of-starvation-in-yemen-1358665283787">famine</a>; 1.3 million cases of <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA13/20190306/109038/HHRG-116-FA13-Wstate-KonyndykJ-20190306.pdf">cholera</a>, 10,000 new cases each week.</p><p>The reason why the United States is complicit is because of our <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/21806/yemen-war-saudi-arabia-uae-trump-obama-famine-power-khanna-sanders">military aid</a> to the Saudi-led coalition.

When I hear the jets flying over I worry about my two children but I also run to the places the bombs have hit to take pictures or to help people. Many airstrikes have targeted buildings near me. Many times the airstrikes have targeted the windows of my house. But I don't feel fear anymore and neither do many other Yemenis.</p><p>I left commercial designs – such as logos and motion graphics – and began to represent what was happening around me and get publicity for the ongoing situation.</p><p>Firstly, what is happening in Yemen isn't a civil war, it’s an aggression led by Saudi Arabia, which is fully supported by the White House. Yemen faces everyday airstrikes and a shortage of food and medicine because of the Saudi-led coalition blockade.</p><p>I still make ‘art for peace’ in Yemen after four years of war, as well as art about war crimes. But I also make artwork showing how Yemenis are strong and are still resisting this aggression.</p><p>In my artwork only two words appear: ‘war’ and ‘peace’. I'm just trying to show the ugliness of war, what happens because of war while the world is watching in silence.

In June the UAE—nominally Saudi Arabia's main partner in the coalition supporting the government of the president, Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, in the Yemen war—began a gradual military withdrawal from Yemen that the UAE government has justified as consistent with a UN-sponsored truce between the Saudi‑led Arab coalition and the rebel Shia Houthi movement. The UAE has sought to distance itself from the core Yemen conflict, leaving Saudi Arabia saddled with the burden of prosecuting the war.</p><p>The latest air strikes have further soured Saudi Arabia's ties with its <a href="http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=1953442379">putative ally</a> and reportedly prompted the Saudi king, Salman bin Abdel‑Aziz al‑Saud, to express "extreme irritation" with the Emirati leadership. The air strikes have exposed and deepened the strains in the UAE-Saudi relationship, with the Riyadh-based Yemeni government of Mr Hadi openly calling for the expulsion of the UAE from the Saudi‑led coalition.</p><p>Escalating regional tensions are causing difficulties between allies</p><p>There have been differences in priorities between the UAE and Saudi Arabia throughout the military campaign. Saudi Arabia has been keen to defeat what they view as Iranian proxies in the Houthi rebellion and to keep Yemen united and has been willing to work with Islamist groups. In contrast, the UAE has been willing to support secessionist groups in Yemen, viewing Islamist groups as a bigger threat to its security.</p><p><a href="http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=268427610&amp;Country=United%20Arab%20Emirates&amp;topic=Politics">http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=268427610&amp;Country=United%20Arab%20Emirates&amp;topic=Politics</a></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>How the UAE and Saudi Arabia have destabilised the Arab World</p><p>From the war in Yemen and support for renegade Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar to the blockade of Qatar, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are intimately involved in contributing to instability in the Middle East.</p><p>Since the start of the Arab uprisings in 2011, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have actively intervened in several states to put an end to the democratic aspirations of the citizens of those countries.</p><p>In some instances, the two states have not shied away from direct military intervention, supporting warlords and imposing economic boycotts, in order to get their way.</p><p><a href="http://www.newnewss.net/how-the-uae-and-saudi-arabia-have-destabilised-the-arab-world/">http://www.newnewss.net/how-the-uae-and-saudi-arabia-have-destabilised-the-arab-world/</a></p><p><span>(*B K P)</span></p><p>[From 2016:] The Middle East Impasse - Human &amp; Political Cost of the Faustian Gulf Armageddon</p><p>Alarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by Iran, Sunni Arab states began an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government, which believes the solution to Yemen's 2½ year-old civil war will likely come through military rather than political means. Other writers believe the route to sustained stability requires active engagement of all stakeholders in the conflict and a complete abandonment of the 'no negotiations' stance that has all too often plagued the conflict.</p><p>The UN must initiate an immediate ceasefire and start the peace negotiations in a multilateral context in order to establish an inclusive government in the war-torn country. The conflict in Yemen can be resolved. A key move to this end involves Western countries ending their support of the Saudi military intervention, and also increased pressure on the Saudi monarchy to understand the necessity of change in the country. Riyadh must accept the fact that Yemen cannot return to its pre-Arab spring form and reality. It is necessary to help foster a Yemeni state with sufficient legitimacy to permit a sustained rebuilding process.</p><p>An inclusive regional agreement may be the best path to do so because Yemeni leaders do not trust one another. Of course, regional leaders do not agree either, but there may be no other path to peace. Most observers agree that there is no military solution to the conflict. If there is no military solution, there appears to be no peaceful solution either. A regional settlement that includes Russia and Iran on the side of the Houthis and Saleh, and the US and Gulf states on the Hadi side, is one way to give enough confidence to local actors to the effect that peace is possible.</p><p>The only region in the world without a security framework must at long last set about the task of creating one that can give due consideration to harmonising the mandate of the regional security framework with the UN Charter, while ensuring that the framework has enough teeth to thwart aggression and react to security threats against its members.</p><p>Indeed, the frustration for the well-meaning international humanitarian community is that the Yemeni peace suggests itself seems within reach only to elude and appears readily practicable only to resist realisation.

People no longer have to travel hundreds of miles to seek care, there are now health facilities that have been equipped through the Project to meet their needs.</p><p>The EHNP also supports the water and sanitation services in Yemen. Since the beginning of the project, more than 1.5 million people have gained access to safe water. Around 2 million now have safe access to sanitation services. Water quality has improved by 50% in areas at high risk of diseases in several governorates.</p><p>This Nexus has resulted in greater functionality; some facilities that were once damaged are now fixed. Greater functionality has led to greater service availability, ensuring millions now have access to healthcare</p><p><a href="https://www.unicef.org/yemen/reports/emergency-health-and-nutrition-project-photobook">https://www.unicef.org/yemen/reports/emergency-health-and-nutrition-project-photobook</a> = <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/emergency-health-and-nutrition-project-photobook">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/emergency-health-and-nutrition-project-photobook</a></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>It is hard to work when you are asking yourself how to feed your own children</p><p>“It is difficult for a teacher to do his work and pass on his knowledge to students that don’t have anything else than a piece of bread to eat,” says the teacher Hamoud Hassan Qaed when asked about the main challenges in his profession. “And I cannot teach them properly if I have to walk two hours every day from my home to the school and back because I don’t have money to pay for transportation,” Hamoud continues. “Sometimes, I have to make an impossible choice between buying breakfast for my children or use the money to pay for transportation to school,” says Hamoud.</p><p>Hamoud is a chemistry teacher at Al-Mokhtar High School in Sana’a. He is 47 years old and a father of eight children. He has been working in the education sector for the past 18 years. However, he is forced to look for other jobs in the last three years since he is not receiving his public servant salary anymore.</p><p>“What do we expect from teachers who haven’t received their monthly payment for three years?” Hamoud asks himself. “We count the days, the months, the years waiting for a glimmer of hope to be able to withstand more. But it is hard to work when we are busy asking ourselves how to feed our own children,” he says.</p><p>When he heard about the UNICEF-supported conditional cash assistance project for school- based staff and teachers, Hamoud regained some hope. </p><p><a href="https://www.unicef.org/yemen/stories/it-hard-work-when-you-are-asking-yourself-how-feed-your-own-children">https://www.unicef.org/yemen/stories/it-hard-work-when-you-are-asking-yourself-how-feed-your-own-children</a></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Map: iMMAP, Protection Cluster: </span>Child Protection Area of Responsibility - Yemen: Thematic 3W (Who, What, Where) in 2018</p><p><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/child-protection-area-responsibility-yemen-thematic-3w-who-what-where-2018">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/child-protection-area-responsibility-yemen-thematic-3w-who-what-where-2018</a></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/wfp">World Food Programme</a>, <a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/logistics-cluster">Logistics Cluster</a>: UNHAS Flight Schedule, October 2019</p><p><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unhas-flight-schedule-october-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unhas-flight-schedule-october-2019</a></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/usaid">US Agency for International Development</a>: Yemen: Health Fact Sheet - September 2019</p><p>USAID supports life-saving maternal, child health and family planning services, and a stronger health system that reaches the most vulnerable populations.</p><p>In Yemen,19.7 million people lack access to basic health services.

While the former pretends to be completely biased in favour of the legitimacy, which requested its interference, the latter has adopted a clear position in favour of its military militias in the south.</p><p>It is true that there is a difference between them reflected in some of their positions, statements and media policy, but that remains within the details, and not the objectives. Their objectives are very much shared, at least in the short and medium terms.</p><p>There is an explanation circulating that the coalition wants the situation to remain as it currently is, where Aden, part of Abyan, along with Ad Dali, and Lahij remain in the hands of the STC and the forces of “legitimacy” remain on the doors of Zinjibar. This leaves it unable to regain its temporary capital until it agrees to talks with the new rebels in order to legitimise their reality. This opinion is reinforced by the statements made by Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, which continuously reiterate the call for immediate and unconditional dialogue. This simply means legitimising the <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190911-socotra-uae-continues-to-train-militias-amid-coup-plot-against-yemen-government/">coup</a> and including those who staged it in the legitimate government, which still remains committed to its position of refusing any dialogue before the current situation is brought to an end.</p><p>The legitimate government has no other choice but to remain committed to this position, exercise political manoeuvres and play all of the cards it has. These include threatening to lodge a complaint at the <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190829-yemen-condemns-uae-airstrikes-on-government-forces/">UN Security Council</a> against the UAE’s actions as well as filing suits against it in international European courts, thus exposing its crimes in several forums.</p><p>On the ground, it must take certain steps to impose a fait accompli and invest popular and tribal support in strengthening its political and military position. It needs to avoid the trap of relying on the game of time and waiting for the situation to cool down, which is what the coalition wants.</p><p>It should not agree to dialogue before legitimacy and its civilian and military institutions are restored to Yemen and the rebel militias are disbanded.</p><p><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190913-the-saudi-uae-game-in-yemen/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190913-the-saudi-uae-game-in-yemen/</a></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>He said al-Burkani refused to condemn the army's targeting.

The People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen existed from 1967 to 1990, when it was reunited with the north and was the only communist Arab country in the world.</span></p><p><span>The political landscape has changed drastically since the days of Soviet patronage but assisting me in understanding the current, fluid situation was the UK spokesperson for the STC, Saleh Al-Noud, who spoke to MEMO over the weekend at a pro-UAE demonstration in London.</span></p><p><span>“Saudi versus the UAE?</span></p><p><span>However, these ambitions are at odds with the pro-unity stance of coalition leader Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni government.</span></p><p>When asked about these tensions, the STC spokesperson acknowledged that “To a degree, I think there is a slight difference.” The UAE, he said, is clear in what it wants to achieve in Yemen in terms of creating stability and fighting against terrorism. “Evidence has shown that there is some relation with the legitimate government… it’s a card that it has played in the past,” he insisted, in reference to the Islah links and Al-Qaeda affiliations.</p><p>Proof of ongoing collaboration, Al-Noud suggested, is a “massive army in the city of Marib” which is an Islah stronghold situated in a northern province of the same name. “They should be fighting with the coalition against the Houthis,” but when tensions arose in the south, the <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190905-islah-militias-move-towards-yemens-south-as-uae-sends-more-troops/">Islah militia headed in that direction</a>, despite being “ready, able to fight and fully equipped” to tackle the Houthis.</p><p><span>The Saudis were not exclusive in their support of the Muslim Brotherhood-aligned Islah Party in this current conflict. “Initially, even the Emiratis backed it,” explained Al-Noud, but once it became clear that they had their own agenda, such support ended.</span></p><p><span>Indeed there is speculation that with both countries deploying more troops in the south, such actions may raise the prospects for clashes and escalation of the conflict from mere disagreements to something more serious between the Gulf neighbours.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t think they will come to that,” said Al-Noud dismissively. He believes that the Saudis have bigger concerns in supporting the so-called legitimate government. “It’s what gives the Saudis and the coalition the mandate to be involved.” Hence it is in Saudi interests to keep it going. The reality is, though, that it is a fragile government which presents the Saudis with a serious problem in terms of maintaining some legitimacy and involvement.”</span></p><p>Regional autonomy</p><p>Concerning the contested city of Aden, its British-based spokesperson says that the STC is open to dialogue with the Yemeni government and has “no problem with a government,” but it needs to be “restructured and re-evaluated.” He went as far as to say that the STC is open to Hadi remaining in authority over the south, on the condition that it is a “transitional period and in that period, we run the south,” including its own security.</p><p>It would be a regional government, with no military presence in the south, so that it can focus more on the north to show that it has some legitimacy.

One substantial hurdle is that both the Houthis and the government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi will most likely lose influence as a consequence of a peace agreement. At the same time, the involvement of regional actors in the conflict, such as Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), complicates negotiations. Nevertheless, the EU, including Denmark, should push for a comprehensive peace agreement and an end to the Saudi-led military campaign. However, this is only one element in bringing a sustainable peace to Yemen. A second point of focus should be support to long-term political and economic development, including local development due to the Yemen’s fragmented political reality.</p><p>Political fragmentation </p><p>Economic collapse</p><p>Locally led development can help stabilize Yemen</p><p>Yemen has a long tradition of local development, and extended family networks continue to show remarkable innovation in stretching limited resources. However, whereas the political and economic fragmentation underscores the need for locally relevant approaches, local sources of authority should not be seen as a panacea for all Yemen’s problems. While some local authorities work to mitigate the consequences of the conflict, others are benefitting from its continuation through smuggling, skimming off aid, or taking advantage of the collapse of the central state to keep taxes or incomes from natural resources.</p><p>The political and economic fragmentation means that local actors are increasingly focused on their own areas, whereas the Yemeni central state, which has never had much of a presence outside the larger cities, is seen as obsolete at best and an obstacle at worst.The Yemenis must decide whether there is a future for a united Yemen, but regardless of the overall political structure, locally led decentralization can help stabilize Yemen.</p><p>What can be done? </p><p>First, in order to work effectively in Yemen, with its high degree of political and economic fluidity, it is crucial to prioritize the building of close links with local actors. </p><p>Second, the limited capacity of formal state structures should not lead to the establishment of parallel donor-funded structures.</p><p>Finally, an end to the Saudi-led military intervention is a precondition for peace, but it will not in itself bring peace to Yemen. The international community needs to commit itself to long-term engagement in Yemen if the cycle of continued internal violence is to be broken, as the current conflict has exacerbated political, cultural and economic cleavages – by Maria-Louise Clausen</p><p><a href="https://isnblog.ethz.ch/conflict/achieving-a-sustainable-peace-in-yemen-lies-with-locally-driven-initiatives">https://isnblog.ethz.ch/conflict/achieving-a-sustainable-peace-in-yemen-lies-with-locally-driven-initiatives</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp8 Saudi-Arabien / Saudi Arabia</span></h2><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>Amnesty raises concerns over Anthony Joshua fighting boxing rematch in Saudi Arabia</span></p><p>Rights organisation calls on British boxer to be prepared to speak out about kingdom's 'abysmal human rights record'</p><p><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/amnesty-raise-concerns-about-anthony-joshua-fighting-rematch-saudi-arabia">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/amnesty-raise-concerns-about-anthony-joshua-fighting-rematch-saudi-arabia</a></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Saudis are instructed not to tweet or retweet any info or videos except that from official Saudi news agencies as enemies may benefit from exposing magnitude of damage at oil fields!

With Russia that stubbornly remaining afloat despite the profound post-Cold War existential crisis and the Yeltsin presidencies and continuing unabated to sell gas and oil to the rest of the world, the United States, prisoners of the grip of their neocons, had to necessarily take possession of the countries of the Arab world and of the neighboring North Africa so as to be able to control the local oil supply routes and then launch the definitive attack on their enemy par excellence.</p><p>The peoples of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Iran were therefore trampled so that the destruction of Russia could take place, which would have gone from being a united and sovereign country to a western protectorate divided into at least three parts. This would have been the final move of the Brzezinski doctrine.</p><p>However, something has definitely gone wrong: of the seven countries in question, only Tunisia has been subverted quickly, completely and essentially without blood.</p><p>And then Yemen. It must have been the penultimate country on the list to fall, before the great attack against Iran and before the biggest attack against Russia. But here, too, things did not go as the Americans had thought.</p><p>With Libya reduced to the chaotic condition of a civil war of all against all, Syria that slowly but evidently was heading for victory against its enemies and Iran that extended its influence far beyond simple regional borders, in Washington someone, drugged of poker, thought it was appropriate to raise, sparking a proxy war against the Yemeni population. This did not work either</p><p>Richard Black, Virginia state Senator, is among the few western politicians to whom the brain still runs fine and who maintains a natural sense of honor. Always opposed to the war against Syria, a few hours ago he declared:</p><p>"Saudis tried using cruel bombardment to install a puppet regime in Yemen. They thought they could muscle the poor Houthi tribesmen, but they were wrong. The dramatic success of their attack on Saudi oil production is a huge victory for the Houthis of Yemen and a huge loss for Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammad bin Salman."</p><p>We can say that it is a mistake in which not only the Saudis have fallen, but also the Americans. Black then continued:</p><p>"The U.S. has backed Saudi Arabia's losing ventures. Cut them loose now and end America's brutal war against the people of Yemen.</p><p>The point is just this: Black understands what the Saudis seem unable to understand. And with them, their sponsors in Washington.

Despite Abu Dhabi’s movement in apparent lockstep with Riyadh militarily and diplomatically, after the Saudi-led intervention began in 2015 on behalf of the internationally recognized Hadi government, it has become apparent over the last 18 months or so that, in reality, Saudi and Emirati interests in Yemen were never identical.</p><p>US Changing Course on Yemen, with Iran on Its Mind</p><p>These events prompted Washington to take a fresh look at its policies and its friends in the Gulf, and some changes with regard to both seem to be in store.</p><p> Indeed, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-aligned-houthis-strike-major-saudi-oilfield-11566043672">increasing pace and scope</a>of Houthi drone and missile attacks against Saudi oil and other economic infrastructure, despite having caused little serious damage so far, highlight the kingdom’s vulnerabilities in the event of increased tensions. This factor has probably influenced the administration’s change of course and may have helped persuade the White House to try to convince, or compel, the Saudis to join the talks with the Houthis.</p><p>The administration’s new tack on Yemen may prove to be well timed.

Yemen did not attack Saudi Arabia in 2015. It was the other way around. If you start a war and the other country fights back, you should not be entitled to complain about how unfair the whole thing is.</p><p>The establishment reaction to the Yemeni oilfield strike reminds me of a hearing in the House Foreign Affairs Committee just before the US launched the 2003 Iraq war. As I was arguing against the authorization for that war, I pointed out that Iraq had never attacked the United States. One of my colleagues stopped me in mid-sentence, saying, “let me remind the gentleman that the Iraqis have been shooting at our planes for years.” True, but those planes were bombing Iraq!</p><p>The neocons want a US war on Iran at any cost.

Iran is involved in multiple regional conflicts, which could ignite in the event of a US strike.</p><p>"What could start as a limited tit-for-tat has the potential of quickly turning into a regional conflagration," an expert told Insider.</p><p>Attacks on a major Saudi Arabian oil plant may driving the US and Iran ever closer to open war, after the US blamed the Islamic Republic for attacks on Saudi Aramco's facilities.</p><p>The US is building a case of Iranian guilt for the Saudi Aramco strikes, just as it did for June's tanker bombings, which could be a justification for retaliation strikes. But some experts say that a military strike would not only set off other conflicts in the region, but work against the US's interests.</p><p>Ali Vaez, the Director of the Iran Project at Crisis Group, told Insider the most likely scenario is, "a strike against one or several [Islamic] Revolutionary Guard Corps facilities, maybe even some of Iran's nuclear installations," pointing out that the latter would be risky, given that there are UN inspectors in Iranian nuclear facilities "all of the time." But the IRGC — an elite, paramilitary branch which the US sees as responsible for attacks at the Port of Fujairah in May, as well as June's attacks — is the assumed target for limited strikes.</p><p>Alternately, the US could order a "massive aerial bombardment" against Iran's air defense systems and nuclear infrastructure.</p><p>But none of these options, said Vaez, is ideal; "The best course of action, of course, is not to stumble into a conflict," which he said the US is doing right now as a result of its Iran foreign policy — or lack thereof.</p><p>Although the US would see a limited strike as a warning — "a bloody nose operation," according to Vaez — Iran would almost certainly retaliate.</p><p>Their response would almost certainly include using its proxies — Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and militia groups in Syria and Iraq — to attack US forces or allies in the region.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/us-iran-strike-middle-east-2019-6?r=US&amp;IR=T">https://www.businessinsider.de/us-iran-strike-middle-east-2019-6?r=US&amp;IR=T</a></p><p><span>(* A K P)</span></p><p>China Slams as Irresponsible US Accusations of Iran Involvement in Saudi Oil Attack</p><p>China's Foreign Ministry has censured as “irresponsible” the US accusations that Iran was behind the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia’s key oil installations.</p><p>"Pondering who is to blame in the absence of a conclusive investigation, I think, is in itself not very responsible,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular news briefing in Beijing on Monday.</p><p>“China's position is that we oppose any moves that expand or intensify conflict," she added.</p><p>The spokeswoman also urged relevant parties to exercise restraint and “avoid taking actions that bring about an escalation in regional tensions.”</p><p><a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/09/16/606318/China-raps-irresponsible-US-accusations-Iran">https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/09/16/606318/China-raps-irresponsible-US-accusations-Iran</a></p><p><span>(* A K P)</span></p><p><span>Sen.

Instead, the Islamic Republic’s regional policies are in many ways a continuation of the Pahlavi epoch and not purely a reflection of a <a href="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/defenddemocracy/uploads/documents/FDD-Summit-Brian-Hook.pdf">revolutionary mindset</a>. </p><p>The Shah’s Regional Agenda</p><p>After consolidating power within Iran by the mid-1950s, the Shah’s attention turned to growing Marxist and radical pan-Arab threats to his throne across the Arab world. </p><p>Of all Imperial Iran’s regional engagements, none is more interesting than Lebanon, which Iranian leaders both before and after 1979 have viewed as a key country in terms of projecting their influence in the Middle East.</p><p>The Shah’s policies were more or less in line with the centuries-old approach of Persian kings, who often bestowed upon themselves the extra-territorial title of the “Sultan of the Shia.”</p><p><span>Post-Revolutionary Continuity</span></p><p><span>After 1979, Lebanon remained at the heart of Iran’s regional strategy, now coupled with the internationalism of the revolution.

This concludes that Coalition forces did not target the house.</span></p><p><span>In another report on extrajudicial killings, Coalition jets are cited as striking a Hodeidah hospital, killing seven civilians.</span></p><p><span>On that matter, Mansour said: “Upon verification, it was found that Coalition forces did not target any hospital in Hodeidah on the presented date… On that date, Coalition forces carried out an air raid against Houthi militia concentrations 100 kilometers from Hodeidah using a precision-guided bomb that struck the target accurately.”</span></p><p><span>In another report, Mansour tackled claims on a 2018 airstrike resulting in a number of deaths and injuries in Sanaa.</span></p><p><span>“Upon verification, the panel found credible Coalition intelligence on a Houthi militia site used to store and equip ballistic missiles in Sanaa to strike Saudi Arabia.”</span></p><p><span>“Accordingly, the Coalition carried out an aerial mission on a legitimate military target using a precision-guided bomb that struck its targets accurately, noting that the target struck was 17 kilometers away from Sanaa,” Mansour noted.</span></p><p><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/13256">http://en.adenpress.news/news/13256</a></p><p><span>My comment: Self-whitewashing by the Saudi fake “investigation” team continues.</span></p><p><span>(* A K)</span></p><p><span>Yemeni medics: 135 bodies found after Saudi-led airstrike</span></p><p>Yemeni medics say the final death toll from Saudi-led coalition airstrikes last week on a detention center operated by the Houthi rebels has reached 135 people.</p><p>The attack, which wounded 40 others, was one of the deadliest in more than four years of war in Yemen.</p><p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-7453129/Yemeni-medics-135-bodies-Saudi-led-airstrike.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-7453129/Yemeni-medics-135-bodies-Saudi-led-airstrike.html</a></p><p>My comment: What is the real figure?
