The individuals who spoke to AP about the investigations did so on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.</p><p>Yemeni activists said the actions by the U.N. agencies are welcome but fall short of the kind of investigation needed to track the millions of dollars in supplies and money from aid programs that have gone missing or been diverted to the coffers of local officials on both sides of the conflict since the start of the civil war.</p><p>Over the past three months, the activists have been pushing for aid transparency in an online campaign called “Where Is The Money?” They demand that U.N. and international agencies provide financial reports on how the hundreds of millions of dollars pouring into Yemen since 2015 have been spent. Last year, the agency said international donors pledged $2 billion for humanitarian efforts in Yemen.</p><p>The WHO probe of its Yemen office began in November with allegations of financial mismanagement against Nevio Zagaria, an Italian doctor, who was chief of the agency’s Sanaa office from 2016 until September 2018, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the investigation.</p><p>The only public announcement of the probe came in a sentence buried in the 37 pages of the internal auditor’s 2018 annual report of activities worldwide. The report did not mention Zagaria by name.</p><p>According to several people who spoke to the AP, close ties between U.N. staffers and local officials on both sides of the conflict are common.</p><p>A confidential report by a U.N. panel of experts on Yemen, obtained by the AP, said Houthi authorities constantly pressure aid agencies, forcing them to hire loyalists, intimidating them with threats to revoke visas and aiming to control their movements and project implementation.</p><p>Officials said it’s unclear how many staffers may be aiding combatants. The officials said several incidents in recent years indicate the U.N. staffers may have been involved in the theft of aid supplies.</p><p>Internal U.N. reports from 2016 and 2017 obtained by the AP show several incidents where trucks carrying medical supplies were hijacked by Houthi rebels in the battleground province of Taiz. The supplies were later given to Houthi fighters on the front lines fighting the Saudi-led coalition or sold in pharmacies in territory controlled by the rebel group.</p><p>An official who help draft the reports said it was “obvious there were some individuals who were working with Houthis behind the scene because there was coordination on the movement of trucks.”</p><p>Another official said the U.N.’s inability or unwillingness to address the alleged corruption in its aid programs harms the agency’s efforts to help Yemenis affected by the war.</p><p>“This is scandalous to any agency and ruins the impartiality of U.N.,” the aid official said -by Maggie Michael</p><p><span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/dcf8914d99af49ef902c56c84823e30c">https://www.apnews.com/dcf8914d99af49ef902c56c84823e30c</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-7321487/UN-workers-accused-fraud-theft-handling-Yemen-aid.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-7321487/UN-workers-accused-fraud-theft-handling-Yemen-aid.html</a></span></p><p><strong>and</strong></p><p><strong>(** B E H P)</strong></p><p><span>‘To the hands of aid workers’: Yemenis accuse aid agencies of widespread corruption</span></p><p>AP uncovered a UN investigation into dozens of employees accused of corruption. Yemenis say they believe its just the tip of the iceberg</p><p>The breadth of alleged corruption described in the report is breathtaking for a country where 80 percent of the population requires some form of humanitarian assistance.</p><p>But Yemenis told Middle East Eye that they believe the allegations are only a snapshot of widespread corruption among those who are meant to be helping their country, aided by combatants on all sides.</p><p>Hamid al-Baday, a Sanaa resident, said he believes endemic corruption in Yemen’s aid community has increased steadily since 2015 when the number of international NGOs operating in the country started to rise.</p><p>Baday is a teacher, but like other public servants, has not received a regular salary since August 2016 and relies on food aid. He is part of a group of Yemenis who have launched a campaign, calling for greater transparency from aid agencies.</p><p>“Most Yemenis are in dire need of food and only officials and aid workers enjoy their lives as they receive salaries in US dollars in addition to the corruption inside the organisations,” he told MEE.</p><p>“If those billions arrived for needy people, there would not be anyone in need in Yemen but it arrives to the hands of aid workers.”</p><p>MEE contacted more than one aid worker in Sanaa who were skeptical that the UN employees would have kept sensitive information on computers or hard drives.</p><p>While occasional disputes break out between aid organisations and the Houthis, most of the time, residents say they seem to be working in close concert in northern Yemen.</p><p>In fact, aid workers tell MEE that the Houthis control the work of UN aid agencies and international NGOs so closely that no project can be implemented without the Houthi government’s approval.</p><p>Their work is overseen by the Houthi-run National Authority for the Management and Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Recovery (NAMCHA), based in Sanaa.</p><p>A UN aid worker told MEE on condition of anonymity for security concerns that while UN agencies have received billions of dollars in donations since 2015, the Houthis have made it difficult to get that money to needy people.</p><p>“The Houthi NAMCHA observes all projects and we cannot start any project until NAMCHA agrees on it and many times NAMCHA imposes projects and INGOs agree on it," he said.</p><p>NAMCHA, he added, has all the details about projects, staff, budgets, movements and everything related to the work of UN and INGO agencies.</p><p>“We work under the control of the Houthi government and definitely the Houthis know everything. Corruption happens everywhere, not only in the UN agencies. But the Houthis don’t fight it,” the source added. “If they don’t fight it, that means they are involved in it.”</p><p>In June, a dispute between the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the Houthis broke out over the agency’s concern that food was being diverted away from Yemenis who needed it for profit.</p><p>The aid worker said NAMCHA had not announced any investigations into WFP's accusations.</p><p>“UN and international NGOs are the main income resource for the Houthis as they pay millions of dollars in taxes and fees for NAMCHA so they are not stupid to stop a major resource of incomes,” said the aid worker.</p><p>The revelations of the WHO’s investigation come three months after Yemeni activists, including Baday, launched a campaign online, called "Where is the money", calling for organisations to provide financial reports about how they spend billions of dollars in donations.</p><p>“The corruption has many faces and one face is that traders sell aid food of the UN and INGOs in the market while needy people do not receive it,” said Baday.</p><p>He said he believes the UN and international NGOs are not transparent because they don’t make their financial reports public and demanded that they do so.</p><p>“If there is no corruption in the UN and INGOs, they would have published their financial reports as reactions to the popular demands on social media,” he said.</p><p>A source in the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation declined to comment on the allegations from aid workers that the Houthis are aware of corruption among international NGOs and UN agencies and don't stop it because they benefit.</p><p>Instead, he said that the Houthi government is doing its best in fighting the corruption of UN and international NGOs, but it does not plan to stop the humanitarian work.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hands-aid-workers-yemenis-accuse-aid-agencies-widespread-corruption">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hands-aid-workers-yemenis-accuse-aid-agencies-widespread-corruption</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Don’t let rhetoric fool you: Yemen’s Houthis are much more politically progressive than you think</strong></p><p>Houthi manifesto document sheds light onto the group's much-discussed ideology.</p><p><span>W</span>hen the Houthi—or Ansarullah movement of Yemen is mentioned in the headlines regarding the brutal war currently unfolding in its fifth year since March of 2015, their infamous slogan (known as the “sarkha,” or scream) is often highlighted, ostensibly to portray them as extremists. But how many of us have actually read their official views and policies?</p><p>Sure, “Death to America, Death to Israel” doesn’t exactly invoke liberal beliefs, however the historical and cultural context behind these sharp words goes over the head of the typical Westerner. In the opinion of those sympathizing with this populist Yemeni movement, the sarkha was created as a reaction to “Western imperialism,” specifically the wars waged by NATO states and allies in the Middle East. It refers to those governments, not ordinary citizens. </p><p>In late March of 2019, the “Supreme Political Council” of the “National Salvation Government” (established by the Ansarullah-led authorities in Yemen’s capital city to fill the political vacuum) released a comprehensive reform plan titled the “National Vision to Build the Modern Yemeni State.” At 82-pages in length, it explicates the movement’s goals and visions for improving the conditions in Yemen</p><p>The document begins with a summary of its purpose and its goal: “A modern, democratic, stable and unified Yemen which rests on having strong institutions, the realization of justice, the pursuit of development and a dignified life and standard of living for Yemeni citizens, the protection of the independence of the nation and seeking world peace and appropriate equal cooperation with the other countries of the world.”</p><p>The terms “democracy,” “justice,” and “world peace” are not ones most would associate with the Ansarullah movement, however due to inherent cultural barriers, much of the Anglo-American press has a blind spot concerning key political changes unfolding in Yemen. Westerners must consider the possibility that progressive values have existed within the Ansarullah movement since its inception.</p><p>The report (available in Arabic, English, and French) is packed with statistics and infographics showing the vast cultural and economic benefits that will come to Yemen upon implementation of the reform plan. This is a trajectory carefully constructed by a political class and intelligentsia who have studied Western democracies, hoping to apply many of the same values to Yemeni civil society and government.</p><p>This includes total freedom of press and freedom of expression, as well as a system that enables a bipartisan parliamentary system where no party or political group is above all others. As a prime indicator, detainees held behind bars “for reasons of opinion” are slated to be released. Amid the chaos of the war, Ansarullah <span><a href="https://cpj.org/2019/05/cpj-calls-on-houthis-in-yemen-to-release-all-detai.php">has been accused of holding prisoners of conscience.</a></span></p><p>Other objectives of the Ansarullah-backed National Salvation Government include: raising female participation to 30% of the entire labour force by 2030 from a dismal 6% currently (according to latest <span><a href="https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Yemen/Female_labor_force_participation/">2018 report by the Global Economy</a></span>); instituting a mass literacy campaign; establishing mandatory and free education for the children of the poor; making five Yemeni universities amongst the best universities in the Arab world; and improving Yemen’s world ranking in technology innovation.</p><p>And lastly, no statecraft manifesto is complete without thoughts on international relations. The document does not present any radical foreign policy plan, rather it primarily stresses the importance of establishing diplomatic ties with countries based on bilateral agreements. There is no specific ideological imprint on it. It reads like a typical government document that could be from any developed nation on earth. </p><p>Why the media has been silent on the publication of the “National Vision to Build the Modern Yemeni State” has yet to be answered; this is puzzling since it is the only document that can be considered a manifesto for the Houthi Ansarullah group. It is secular and progressive in its wording and tone, and the values presented are those that we in Western society hold dear to our hearts. It offers a rare glimpse into the objectives of Ansarullah– something political analysts have been unable to decipher for years.

While its true impact remains officially unknown, collating data across multiple studies suggests that <em>at least 1 million and as many as 6 million Muslims </em>may have been directly and indirectly killed since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, through a sequence of inter-state wars, civil conflicts, and military interventions involving major powers, as well as Muslim and non-Muslim regimes.</p><p>Although death toll figures are often hotly contested due to their moral and political implications, even the most conservative figures demonstrate a colossal scale of deaths, raising urgent questions about the legitimacy of Western and non-Western militarism.</p><p>The escalation suggests that this uptick in mass violence in different parts of the world, many instances of which are genocidal in character, is not an unhappy coincidence but rather a product of a wider pattern of relationships integral to the way the modern world system has developed.</p><p>War in Yemen: a genocidal campaign</p><p>One <span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01436597.2018.1539910">new study</a></span> published earlier this year pinpoints the genocidal nature of the US-UK backed Saudi war on Yemen. Authored by genocide scholar Professor Jeffrey Bachman of the School of International Service at the American University in Washington DC, the paper examines the scale, pattern and intentionality of the coalition bombing campaign across Yemen.</p><p>Genocidal violence in Syria</p><p>Bachman is also the author of an earlier major genocide study focusing on reconceptualising the nature and impact of the US government’s relationships with genocidal regimes — <em>The United States and Genocide: (Re)Defining the Relationship</em>, published by Routledge.</p><p>NATO’s genocidal military intervention in Libya</p><p>Just as unrest was breaking out in Syria, conflict was also breaking out in Libya, eventually prompting NATO intervention to topple Colonel Qaddafi.</p><p>Post-9/11 genocidal wars</p><p>The eruption of this sequence of regional conflicts from Libya, to Yemen, to Syria followed directly from the destabilization of the region that had begun with the 2003 Iraq War.</p><p>Politicization of the body count</p><p>At the time of publication, the PSR study was attacked by a number of researchers associated with the IBC project. T</p><p>The extent of complicity</p><p>It is not entirely surprising that some social scientists are actively being coopted by Western government agencies to promote models which underplay the violent impact of Western wars.</p><p>In all these conflicts, Western states have been directly complicit through various mechanisms of geopolitical interference, proxy warfare, aerial bombardment, and sponsorship of parties engaged in violence.</p><p>But it is important to note that complicity does not solely belong to Western states. Complicity also involves, often principally, multiple non-Western states engaged in exacerbating mass violence, including major rival powers like Russia, as well as Muslim regimes such as the Gulf states, Iran and Turkey.</p><p>Equally, this often does not obviate Western complicity in genocidal violence against Muslim groups. Complicity frequently extends to cases where Western powers may not be directly involved, but are nevertheless engaged in other mechanisms of indirect support. </p><p>The coming tipping point</p><p>The total number of Muslims who have died since 9/11 in wars for which Western states bear significant culpability is truly staggering. Unfortunately, while we can be reasonably certain of the direct death toll, the scale of indirect deaths remains unknown and we are forced to rely on probable estimates. These estimates are not suggested here as final, but rather as tentative, yet still plausible (and very likely highly conservative), figures which further urgent excess mortality research might be able to firm up.</p><p>At a minimum, focusing purely on the minimum conservative figures based on direct deaths, around which there can be little room for doubt, we have an alarming direct death toll of <em>around 1.2 million Muslims </em>from post-9/11 conflicts in which Western powers along with Muslim regimes, terrorist groups and rival non-Western powers are complicit.</p><p>However, these figures are not only likely to be a severe undercount on their own terms of the actual direct death toll; due to reliance on methods which tend to produce more conservative estimates, they do not account for the volume of deaths that will have been produced as an indirect consequence of wars due to the destruction of health, water and other critical infrastructure, and the impact of direct war casualties on societal functions; they also exclude certain conflicts, focusing on some more well-known conflicts </p><p>This implies that total direct and indirect deaths of Muslims across these six theatres of war a<em>mounts to between 5.3 and 5.7 million people</em>. The full statistical range suggests that <em>at least </em>1.2 million and <em>more likely </em>just under 6 million Muslims have died in the sequence of regional conflicts since 9/11. Once again, this analysis cannot provide precision, but gives a conservative sense of the likely order of magnitude – by Nafeez Ahmed</p><p><span><a href="https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/the-global-pandemic-of-anti-muslim-genocidal-violence-c9e735d4575e">https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/the-global-pandemic-of-anti-muslim-genocidal-violence-c9e735d4575e</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Saudi crown prince seeks to fast track trial of Khashoggi suspects</strong></p><p>Confidential Emirati document reveals Mohammed bin Salman is concerned the journalist's murder could become a heavily debated topic during the upcoming US election</p><p>The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman is determined to “fast track” court proceedings against the murder squad sent to kill Jamal Khashoggi, before Donald Trump’s re-election campaign starts in earnest.</p><p>Mohammed bin Salman, who is thought by the CIA and Turkish investigators to have ordered the killing of Saudi journalist Khashoggi, wants to close the chapter as soon as possible, according to a report based on Emirati intelligence.</p><p>“It was a wise step for Riyadh to move quickly to close the case and indict those responsible before the start of the American presidential election,” the document says. “Otherwise the killing could have been turned into one of the presidential debate topics.”</p><p>The report is one of a monthly series written by the <span><a href="http://www.epc.ae/">Emirates Policy Centre</a></span>, a think tank with close links to the Emirati government and security services.</p><p>Entitled “Monthly Report on Saudi Arabia, Issue 24, May 2019”, the document is of limited circulation and intended for the Emirati leadership.

It’s also based on similar, though not identical, worldviews in which political Islam and Iranian influence form two destabilizing forces in the Middle East. Nevertheless, just like in romantic relations, the more they are becoming intense and weighty, the more difficulties they reveal.</p><p>The recent tension in the Gulf affords a glimpse into one of many disputes between Saudi Arabia and the UAE on appropriate responses to common challenges, this time with Iran. While Saudi Arabia took a public stance using confrontational language vis-à-vis Iran, the UAE remained more vague in its media coverage of events and did not point an unequivocal finger of blame towards Iran. </p><p>An additional dispute between the two countries relates to the war in Yemen.</p><p>Despite the increasing tension and apparent disagreements between the countries, their relationship is yet far from crisis, as it is based on deep ideological and strategic partnership. The disagreements at this point mainly revolve around methods of action and degrees of force that each of the sides is interested in applying, whether in regard to military action, diplomatic decisions or social processes. Of the two, the UAE behaves as the "responsible adult" in its tactical choices, while Mohammed bin Salman has been portrayed as more reckless. </p><p>In the past, both the UAE and Saudi Arabia demonstrated restraint in conducting their foreign affairs.

But what if they can convince Washington to pick up the slack?</p><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) may have finally learned what Washington will not: that armed interventions with ambiguous aims, unreliable allies, and no exit strategy are doomed to disaster.</p><p>Such interventions will rapidly deplete a nation of its blood and treasure while yielding an abundance of dangerous second- and third-order consequences. </p><p><span>The narrative around the UAE’s withdrawal from Yemen has been carefully managed in the American media with the help of some sympathetic Washington-based think-tanks. The shift in policy has been cast as a “mission accomplished” moment for the UAE. But the UAE is getting out of Yemen not because it is winning—or has won—but because the country’s leadership understands they cannot win. </span></p><p><span>“Little Sparta,” as former secretary of defense James Mattis referred to the UAE, possesses a military that is significantly more competent and capable than that of its main ally in Yemen, Saudi Arabia. However, the UAE and its proxies have failed to defeat Yemen’s Houthi rebels, and while they’ve made some gains against Yemen’s al-Qaeda franchise, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), these will prove fleeting. Such failures come despite the fact that the UAE has spent tens of billions of dollars in Yemen arming and training various militias and security forces.</span></p><p>While the primary reason for this shift is the UAE’s recognition of the futility involved, there were additional reasons for the change. The UAE’s armed forces are small and <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-yemen-s-war-is-a-mercenary-heaven-are-israelis-reaping-the-profits-1.6938348">dependent on mercenaries</a> for everything from ground troops to general officers. The country’s involvement in the war has strained its armed forces and has left it with little spare capacity to deal with a potential conflict with Iran, which provides limited—but important—aid to the Houthis. </p><p>Additionally, the war in Yemen has cost the UAE billions of dollars at a time when its own economy is slowing.</p><p>It is to the credit of the UAE’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Zayad, that he and his government have recognized the ineffectiveness and danger of continued military involvement in Yemen’s interlocking wars. Rather than doubling down, as the U.S. has done so many times in its own failed wars, the UAE has decided to cut its losses and shift its policy to something more pragmatic and achievable. </p><p>Instead of further enabling Saudi Arabia’s aggressive, high-risk, and counterproductive strategy in Yemen, the UAE seems to be recognizing the merits of the subtle, nuanced, and largely de-escalatory policies of its neighbors Oman and <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Dohas-Foreign-Policy-is-Economic-Policy-Analysis-595678">Qatar</a>. </p><p>Without the military involvement of outside powers, it is probable that Yemen’s warring factions will agree on an uneasy and patchwork peace that will in time become more comprehensive and enduring. Yemen’s factions and political parties have a long history of embracing compromise and de-escalation.</p><p>The UAE’s change of heart may mark the beginning of the end of the wars in Yemen. This is not to say that Yemen will be peaceful or unified in the near future. However, as the most competent and capable member of the Saudi-led coalition, the UAE’s withdrawal, even if only partial, will force Saudi Arabia to re-evaluate its own failed strategy – by Michael Horton</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/why-the-uae-cut-their-losses-and-pulled-out-of-yemen/">https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/why-the-uae-cut-their-losses-and-pulled-out-of-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p><span>UAE military drawdown raises hopes of Yemen breakthrough</span></p><p>Saudi ally scales back presence in war-torn country as efforts continue to end conflict</p><p>The question is whether the move by the UAE, until now a key part of the Saudi-led coalition battling Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen, will bolster efforts to end the conflict or leave a void that leads to an escalation of the violence. Mr Obad has little hope it will be the former. “We heard about the withdrawal of Emirati forces as a step towards peace, but we didn’t feel it. The battles are still ongoing,” said Mr Obad, a father of three. “The warring sides try to prove to the world that they seek peace, but their hands remain on the trigger.” His pessimism is not without cause.</p><p>The UAE had been discussing a drawdown for more than a year, but the process gained momentum after the Stockholm agreement was sealed.</p><p>here has also been speculation that the UAE redeployment was in part motivated by a desire to bring home troops and military assets in case the heightened tensions between the US and Iran in recent months trigger a wider conflict. One western official said this fear would lead all parties to de-escalate to avoid creating a “second front”. “I think there is an alignment across the region that peace makes sense . . . for Iran; for Saudi, because it de-escalates its border with Yemen; for the UAE because of its reputational damage,” one western official said. “It is an optimistic view . . . but it is not outside the realm of the possible.” Martin Griffiths, UN special envoy to Yemen, said this month that the conflict was “eminently resolvable”.</p><p>Much will depend on whether the Saudis and Houthis still believe they can achieve a military solution. Some analysts say the rebels, who control northern Yemen, might attempt to take advantage of the UAE’s drawdown to advance south. And while Riyadh insists it wants to end the fighting, there have been reports that it is deploying troops to fill the gap left by the Emiratis.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3a8e2934-ae31-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2">https://www.ft.com/content/3a8e2934-ae31-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Has the UAE jumped the Saudi ship in Yemen?</p><p>Abu Dhabi has realised that the war in Yemen will not be settled militarily. Four years into the coalition’s involvement, there is no indication of a victory any time soon. On the contrary, the UAE has become an occupying force opposed by the Yemenis, who accuse it of seeking to divide Yemen into two distinct entities.</p><p>The ballistic missile and drone attacks by the Houthis have posed a new threat which Abu Dhabi did not take into consideration when it agreed to join the Saud-led coalition. There is also no doubt that the UAE has started to read US intentions more precisely, as President Donald Trump is not intending to engage in a war with Iran, especially while he is preparing a re-election campaign.</p><p>We do not know the exact degree of coordination between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, but we do know that Saudi Arabia tried to dissuade the Emirates from withdrawing from Yemen, but to no avail, apparently. The UAE has started to reconsider its positions and it seems that it does not want to be cannon fodder in an upcoming war. Distancing itself from Saudi Arabia and its policies in the region has become its means of survival in advance of the storm clouds gathering.</p><p>In short, the UAE has realised that the Saudi boat is no longer safe and that it will, almost inevitably, sink; this has pushed Abu Dhabi to jump ship and seek safety. It would not come as a surprise if Riyadh eventually follows suit and also pulls out of Yemen, prompting a similar change in policy with regard to Iran.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190806-has-the-uae-jumped-the-saudi-ship-in-yemen/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190806-has-the-uae-jumped-the-saudi-ship-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>The UAE Withdraws from Yemen</p><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: A UAE decision to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-a-e-moves-to-extricate-itself-from-saudi-led-war-in-yemen-11562094272">withdraw the bulk of its forces from Yemen</a> shines a spotlight on hard realities underlying Middle Eastern geopolitics.

This should mark the beginning of the end for the failed US-backed, Saudi-led war on Yemen.</p><p>The drawdown was not a last-minute decision and had been discussed extensively with Riyadh. It came after the failed attempt to defeat the resistance movement of Ansarullah amid international condemnations for the ongoing human rights violations and war crimes in the war-torn country by the Saudi-led coalition.</p><p>Indeed, behind the drawdown is a disastrous failure of decision-making that led to the war on Yemen in 2015; the signature initiative of the Crown Prince MBS. Thanks to his leadership, Saudi cities and infrastructure are now targets for a once-ragged army that has developed increasingly sophisticated drones and missiles. The war is the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world.</p><p>The Trump administration’s decision to sell billions in arms to Riyadh without congressional approval has only encouraged the crown prince to continue the quagmire too. </p><p>On the other hand, the war on Yemen has exposed the tenuous nature of Saudi Arabia’s relationships with its principal Muslim allies. The most important of them, Pakistan, surprisingly refused to send its army to assist the regime. </p><p>In the prevailing environment, expect the Saudi coalition fighting in Yemen to be forced more into a stalemate following the UAE’s decision. Riyadh and Abu Dhabi had promised a swift campaign in what has now become one of the fiercest battles in the devastating conflict</p><p>Last but not the least, the Saudi coalition’s inability to win or even to advance in Yemen has a two-pronged diagnosis: The fact that the Ansarullah are well-situated to repel foreign fighting forces; and the fact that the Saudi military suffers from its own systemic ineffectiveness and divisions – for instance, the UAE’s failed efforts to bring its power to bear in the fight war and its recent decision to withdraw. </p><p>Which is to say: The illegal war on Yemen has been a disaster for all involved parties, and so ending it is both the smart thing to do as well as the right thing to do under international law and UN Charter.

The Yemeni people face high rates of malnutrition, cholera outbreaks and lack of medical supplies.</p><p>Firstly, because medical facilities in Yemen are lacking essential materials such as clean water, diseases that are easily treatable are deadly. About 80 per cent of the Yemeni population is malnourished, forced to drink unclean water and cannot afford health care, making them more vulnerable to diphtheria, cholera and other diseases. The current war has destroyed infrastructure and health care in Yemen.</p><p>Fact 2: Aerial bombardment hospitals in Yemen have been repeatedly destroyed and it is difficult for hospitals to provide electricity and running water permanently in light of airstrikes. The ongoing fighting did not allow the damage to medical structures to be addressed in order to address the needs of the Yemeni people. Families are often asked to take the sick and wounded to hospitals without the help of ambulances. All 22 governorates of Yemen are affected by the fighting.</p><p>Fact 3: In less than a year of fighting in Yemen, airstrikes hit 39 hospitals. Troops on both sides of the conflict blocked access to medicines and medical supplies from abroad, preventing the flow of medicines needed to treat diseases, such as cholera. This puts the Yemeni people, especially children, at risk; 144 children die every day from curable diseases and more than one million children are starving or malnourished.</p><p>Fact 4: Rural facilities, such as those in the northern highlands, cannot provide enough food for patients. Lack of food in many hospitals prevents successful treatment of malnutrition.</p><p>Fact 5: The cholera epidemic began in Yemen in 2016</p><p><span><a href="https://www.uprising.today/ten-facts-about-healthcare-in-yemen/">https://www.uprising.today/ten-facts-about-healthcare-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p>(B H)</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/echo">European Commission's Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations</a></span>: ECHO Factsheet – Yemen (Last updated 20/07/2019)</p><p>Yemen remains the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. After more than 4 years of a deadly conflict, millions of Yemenis suffer the consequences of intense fighting compounded with looming famine, outbreaks of epidemics and preventable diseases. Civilians face constant threats to their lives, safety, well-being and basic rights. The conflict has been marred by repeated violations of international humanitarian law, including mass civilian casualties and widespread destruction of infrastructure.</p><p>Since the beginning of the conflict in 2015, the European Union has allocated €440 million in humanitarian aid to the Yemen crisis. In 2019, a total of €115 million has been allocated to humanitarian organisations to boost lifesaving efforts.</p><p>The EU’s humanitarian aid programmes provide life-saving assistance, such as food, water, emergency shelter, and hygiene items, to people in war-affected areas and to displaced populations.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/echo-factsheet-yemen-last-updated-20072019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/echo-factsheet-yemen-last-updated-20072019</a></span></p><p>(B H)</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/wfp">World Food Programme</a></span>, <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/logistics-cluster">Logistics Cluster</a></span>: Logistics Cluster: January - June 2019 Training Overview</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/logistics-cluster-january-june-2019-training-overview">https://reliefweb.int/report/world/logistics-cluster-january-june-2019-training-overview</a></span></p><p>(* B H)</p><p>War Is The Enemy Of Breastfeeding</p><p>The babies arrive small and skinny. To a health worker's eye, it's clear they're not growing well, though it's often only a health crisis like a fever or severe diarrhea that leads their mothers to make what is almost always a long trek to the Al Salam Hospital in Khamir, Yemen.</p><p>"By then, the babies are too weak to breastfeed," says Fiona Bay, a nurse with Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) at the hospital.</p><p>The neonatal unit of Al Salam in the war-torn country is seeing an increasing number of malnourished infants, and providers say that mothers are reporting that they cannot breastfeed their babies. Studies on breastfeeding in a conflict zone are scarce, but a few suggest that war and violence are tremendous obstacles to a mother's ability to breastfeed her baby.</p><p>"Breastfeeding is about emotions as well," says <span><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3t5_A1_CGlI">Jane Hancock in a YouTube presentation</a></span>. She is a nurse with MSF at the Al Salam Hospital in Yemen. "When you are living in a stressful environment, you are <em>not</em> going to produce breast milk. And this is a very stressful environment."</p><p>The undernourished and sickly infants who make it to the hospital in Yemen can almost always be stabilized in a few days, says Bay, and their mothers are sent home better educated about breastfeeding. But no one has looked at how many infants in war zones who never get to the hospital have health problems, or even die, because of inadequate breastfeeding.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/08/06/748589823/war-is-the-enemy-of-breastfeeding">https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/08/06/748589823/war-is-the-enemy-of-breastfeeding</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span>Film: Kampf ums Überleben im Jemen</span></p><p>Krieg und Zerstörung machen das Leben im Jemen sehr schwer.

The latest attack targeted Munir Al Yafee (Abu Al Yamama) him and his companions were victims of coward actions as well as those who lost their lives in the Sheikh Othman police explosion which went off at the same time.<br /> Investigations proved that both attacks were the make of the terrorist militias in coordination with the Muslim brotherhood (Islah Party) pockets, who are supported by the government and are allowed to operate freely in the south.<br /> Therefore the people of the south declare here from this square that they will no longer tolerate those heinous acts and announce the following :<br /> First: The government must leave the capital Aden and all the cities of the south immediately.<br /> Second: President Abedulrabbo Mansour Hadi and the brothers in the Arab coalition to transfer all powers to the southern territory peacefully and hand it to the peoples legal representative; the Southern Transitional Council.<br /> Third: To evacuate all the northern military units that are stationed in the south and transferee them to the battlefronts in the war against the Houthis in the north.<br /> Forth: To implement the Tripartite Commission Agreement which was agreed between President Hadi the Arab coalition and the Security Belt Forces, which states to remove all camps from the capital Aden except the Support Security Forces to protect the security and stability of the city.</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/11966">http://en.adenpress.news/news/11966</a></span></p><p>My comment: How a mass rally could issue a statement?

Aden was the target of two terrorist attacks targeting Sheikh Othman Police Station and Al-Galaa Camp of Al-Berika while our soldiers were preparing for the graduation ceremony of a new patch before heading to the battels of honor against the expansive Iranian agenda, side by side with our brothers of the Arab Coalition. <br /> In that traitorous attack, a group of most brave and noble soldiers of the security and military forces martyred and among them the brave hero of the south brigadier “Muneer Mahmoud Mohamed (Abu Yamama)”. Those martyrs sacrificed their lives and soles for the dignity and independence of the south. <br /> Dear heroes all over the south. We are paying our condolences to you. At the same time, we are calling for you to be fully alert to defend our lands, our people and our religion. Be alert to guarantee the freedom, safety, stability and independence of our nation. <br /> Brave warriors of the south. Your delegated commandership of the Southern Transitional Council asserts to you from Aden, capital of the South, that we are with you, doing the best we can to maintain and preserve the safety and security of our homeland. <br /> The council’s leadership announces a permanent meeting status to identify those who are behind this vicious act. We assure you that we will work on stabilizing matters on the ground. The council’s leadership understands the public anger and the massive loss but this will only make us more persistent to avenge those heroes. While we are patiently discussing all related issues, we demand you to exercise self-control and be patient so that our enemies don’t affect us. </p><p><span><a href="https://en.smanews.org/southern-transitional-council-issues-a-statement-about-the-two-traitorous-terrorist-attack-of-sheikh-othman-police-station-and-al-galaa-camp-of-al-berika">https://en.smanews.org/southern-transitional-council-issues-a-statement-about-the-two-traitorous-terrorist-attack-of-sheikh-othman-police-station-and-al-galaa-camp-of-al-berika</a></span></p><p>(A P)</p><p>Southern Lawmakers Demand International Investigation on Northern Occupation Troops Crimes Against Southern People</p><p>Southern lawmakers demand Un and other International Human Rights Bodies to quickly protect the southern people from brutal crimes of northern occupation troops. <br /> According to them, vicious crimes against the southern people started with fanatic “Fatwa” of Muslim Brotherhood leaders considering the southern as atheists.
