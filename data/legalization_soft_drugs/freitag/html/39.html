I cried so hard — I was terrified.</p><p>When war first escalated in 2015, I was living happily with my family in Taiz city. It saddens me how the city I loved, the city that holds all my memories since I was a child turned overnight into a ghost town full of death and fear.</p><p>Bombs fell everywhere</p><p>It all started with a bright blue spark that lit up the sky and invaded our houses and the rooms we hid in silently before we heard the crack. That was the first missile to hit nearby.</p><p>After that many bombs fell everywhere, we thought it could be our house any minute. We tried not to panic but panic was all we could feel.</p><p>I still remember that blue light like a nightmare I never imagined coming true and that I would have to live through with the ones I love.</p><p>The next day I went to a friend’s house to say goodbye. She was travelling abroad. We could hear tanks in the streets nearby, roads were blocked, and we were trapped inside her house, away from our families who kept calling to check if we were okay.</p><p>I won’t forget the terror in the children’s eyes, my friends’ brothers and sisters who were with us. I remember vividly the heavy sounds of gun fire and tanks screeching just a few kilometers away.</p><p>We were trapped for 3 days, inside the house, there was no one else with us, just women and children hiding across the stairs, away from windows. We managed to survive with the limited food available for us all.</p><p>“I cried so hard”</p><p>I still remember the amount of fear, oppression and humiliation that day brought. I cried so hard, I cried and cried, all along the way back. I was terrified!</p><p>That day was sadly just a warning of what was to come — the feelings of fear, paralysis and vulnerability.</p><p>And five years later, that feeling of being trapped is one I and other Yemeni women feel constantly.</p><p>What I and others do strive to do though, is to fight that feeling and do all that is in our power to lead, to help others, and to feel hope that this conflict will end, and our lives can return to normal. Life on the move</p><p>As I have moved from place to place to seek shelter, I often took all my savings, my survival kit — this would support my large family.</p><p>Being on the move before I hadn’t received my salary. We would stay in family houses often too small for 30 people. Some family members left and joined the many displaced families who used schools as shelter.</p><p>At one point everything seemed calm and people started to feel safe until one day 6 missiles fired by jets from above hit a nearby mosque destroying it completely. Most of the injured were women and children.</p><p>While a close relative of mine was helping to rescue the injured women, another airstrike hit and took his life. We were so scared for the many whose lives were lost and in danger, we didn’t even find time to mourn him properly (photos)</p><p><span><a href="https://medium.com/@Oxfam/no-woman-should-cry-again-not-the-way-i-did-my-life-as-a-yemeni-woman-ac8cbcafbe13">https://medium.com/@Oxfam/no-woman-should-cry-again-not-the-way-i-did-my-life-as-a-yemeni-woman-ac8cbcafbe13</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span>Yemen: The doctor on the front line after years of war</p><p>Dr Mekkia Mahdi works at the health clinic in Aslam, an impoverished town in the north west of Yemen.</p><p>It is only 60km (37 miles) from the border with Saudi Arabia, but is on the front line of Yemen’s health emergency.</p><p>The BBC spent time with her on the morning rounds, as she checked on the progress of her vulnerable patients.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-51774538/yemen-the-doctor-on-the-front-line-after-years-of-war">https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-51774538/yemen-the-doctor-on-the-front-line-after-years-of-war</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1 Am wichtigsten / Most important</span></h2><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>YEMEN DATA PROJECT AIR RAIDS SUMMARY MARCH 2020</strong></p><p>25 Children Killed Amid Sharp Rise in Bombings</p><p><em>Saudi-led coalition air raids reach highest rate in more than a year</em></p><p>February saw the highest number of air raids in a single month since December 2018 and one of the deadliest air raids for children since the coalition's air campaign began in 2015.</p><p>155 Saudi-led coalition bombings in the month resulted in 58 civilian casualties, 43 of them children - the highest number of casualties in a single month since August 2019.

No air raids were recorded in Al-Hazm in February, which pro-Houthi fighters reportedly sized control of on March 1st from anti-Houthi forces. </p><p>Saudi coalition air raids in February more than doubled from the previous month, a continuation of the near fourfold increase seen in January from the record monthly low of 18 bombings in December 2019.<br /> Civilian casualty numbers jumped from 4 in January to 58.<br /> The highest number of air raids recorded in a single month remains September 2015 at 920, which was also the deadliest month in the air war when at least 756 civilians were killed.<br /> April 2015 saw the highest number of civilian casualties (fatalities and injured) in a single month at 1,745.</p><p><span><a href="https://mailchi.mp/b053fb64ac3f/march2020-yemen-data-project-update-633499">https://mailchi.mp/b053fb64ac3f/march2020-yemen-data-project-update-633499</a></span></p><p><strong>(** A K)</strong></p><p><strong>US-, britische Truppen in Aden - weitere sollen in strategischen Gebieten Jemens eintreffen</strong></p><p>Nach Angaben der von den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten (VAE) unterstützten Separatisten im Südjemen, sind Hunderte von US-amerikanischen und britischen Streitkräften in der Hafenstadt Aden als erste Gruppe einer großen Streitmacht eingetroffen.</p><p>Washington und London wollen unter dem Deckmantel der Terrorismus-Bekämpfung ihre Kräfte in den ressourcenreichen Gebieten des arabischen Landes stationieren.</p><p>Laut Fadi al-Murshidi, Medienvertreter des sogenannten Übergangsrats des Südens (STC), kamen rund 450 US-amerikanische und britische Soldaten in Aden an, berichtete die al-Masa-Presse.

However, following the fall of al-Jawf, some media reports indicated that the Houthis are conducting negotiations with Marib tribes to hand over the province peacefully and avoid escalation, as tribal leaders in Sanaa who are aligned with Houthis are still in contact with tribes in Marib.

Well, for one, Yemen’s civil war has been raging for years, with no end in sight, and with war, especially civil war in a poor and developing nation, comes a myriad of negative consequences, including poor healthcare and rampant diseases. At this point, Yemen is considered a failed state, and there is no clear government to provide goods or care for the Yemeni people.

Initially, I thought they were trying to improve their position on the ground in anticipation of a return to the negotiating table,” he said. </p><p>“Now, it appears that at least some factions within the Houthi movement are once again seeking a military victory or, at least, to secure complete control in the north.”</p><p>The partition of Yemen — the main demand of hard-line factions in southern Yemen — would only complicate the situation in the country, Feierstein argues. </p><p>“I have always been clear that I believe secession would be a wrong step for Yemen,” he said. “First, there’s no reason to believe that Yemenis would agree to return to the two states that existed pre-1990; second, I don’t believe that a divided Yemen would offer greater security, political, or economic stability to the Yemeni people than a united Yemen could offer.”</p><p>The former ambassador’s third reason for rejecting partition is that he believes a federal system that grants regions the right to self-rule would be preferable.</p><p>Feierstein blasted those who speak fondly of the former president’s rule and those who push to empower his relatives and loyalists. “The root causes of the current conflict can be found in the record of Ali Abdullah Saleh’s rule,” he said.</p><p>“I believe that Al-Qaeda initially believed it would be able to expand as a result of the anti-Saleh movement, the security collapse and the beginning of the civil war,” he says. “But Yemenis are not extremists. Most Yemenis are not attracted to Al-Qaeda’s vision. Therefore, Al-Qaeda has largely failed in its efforts to deepen its roots in Yemen.” </p><p>And Feierstein does not agree with the government’s repeated demand to designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization. “It’s clear from popular attitudes toward the Houthi movement that most Yemenis disagree with their strategy, their tactics, and their vision,” he says. “But that’s different than being a terrorist organization. The Houthis need to be defeated as an anti-Yemeni movement.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1640706/middle-east">https://www.arabnews.com/node/1640706/middle-east</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Yemeni operation .. to free Jawf or defend Saudi borders?: AA</p><p>"Was the al-Jawf swift operation to liberate [al-Yatma] or to defend Saudi borders?</p><p>The Anadolu Agency (AA) has shed light on the massive operation recently launched by the Yemeni internationally-recognized government to restore al-Yatma in the Yemeni northern governorate of al-Jawf, shortly after Houthi seizure.</p><p>"Was the al-Jawf swift operation to liberate [al-Yatma] or to defend Saudi borders?" under this headline the AA reported on Thursday that Yemen's official army and tribesmen restored the area, near Saudi borders, and defeated Houthis.</p><p>"Thanks to Saudi-outflowed weapons and concentrated airstrikes on Houthi gatherings in different areas of Khab &amp; al-Sha'af district, in range of which al-Yatma is located, the Yemeni government restored the lead," a military source told the AA.</p><p>"The coalition aircraft paved the way for the operation in al-Yatma, with some 15 focused, successive airstrikes on Houthi gunmen, facilitating its restoration within hours," the source added.</p><p>The operation was widely hailed by Yemenis on social media, in support of the army and in a bid to recover from the shock following the loss of al-Hazm (Jawf provincial capital) and large swaths of Nihm, known as the eastern gate of the capital Sana'a.</p><p>With supporters of the legitimate government pleased about the army's advance, chances have lessened to ask why the Saudi-led coalition balked at launching a similar operation to retake Nihm, which was seized by Houthis last January.</p><p>Nihm is of far greater strategic importance than al-Yatma for the Yemeni government in terms of the military equation's balances, as its restoration is connected to the core goals and aims of the battle fought by the government against the Houthi group.</p><p>Besides the fact that it is a window for the Yemeni army to advance toward and restore Sana'a from Houthis, Nihm also serves as the first line to defend the government's strongholds in Marib and al-Jawf. Following its loss late in January, the internationally-recognized government has incurred one of the strongest blows since the war outbreak in 2015.</p><p>Because of scarce resources and acute lack of ordnance in most fighting fronts, the government forces are now putting aside any advance or restoration of more territories, merely taking a defense position to fend off Houthi attacks in Taiz, Dhalea, Baydha and Marib, where fronts have been inactive for some two years.</p><p>These facts further raise doubts as to the coalition's goal, while deepen the belief among Yemenis that agendas have been a stumbling block to restoring the Yemeni areas and cities from Houthi hands.</p><p>With prolonged war and frozen fighting at most of the country's fronts, Yemenis have begun raising the question: why the battle is not won with the Houthi group that controls Sana'a and heavily populated areas in northern Yemen.</p><p>Aden coup, which was plotted by the United Arab Emirates last August against the government, and the overthrow of strategically important areas in north and east of Yemen (Nihm and al-Hazm) in Houthi hands have brought to surface charges against Arab coalition.</p><p>Accusations of diverting from its main mission (namely defeating the Houthis and restoring the Yemeni State) to a strategy giving top priority to defending the Saudi borders, along with coalition member states' economic and political avarices, have been further unveiled by the Emirati role in Yemen's south and west.</p><p><span><a href="https://debriefer.net/en/news-15590.html">https://debriefer.net/en/news-15590.html</a></span></p><p><span>(B P)</span></p><p><span>ACLED Regional Overview – Middle East (1 - 7 March 2020)</span></p><p><span>In Yemen, Houthi forces continued their offensives in Al Jawf governorate, making major territorial gains.

In 2012 the governing and opposition parties chose Vice President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi as the sole consensus candidate for president. Two-thirds of the country’s eligible voters confirmed him as president, with a two-year mandate. In 2014 Houthi forces aligned with forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh occupied the capital, Sana’a, igniting a civil conflict between Houthi forces and the Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) that continued through the year.</p><p>The primary state security and intelligence-gathering entities, the Political Security Organization (PSO) and the National Security Bureau (NSB), came under Houthi control in 2014, although their structure and operations appeared to remain the same. The ROYG staffed the PSO and the NSB in areas under its control. By law the PSO and the NSB report first to the interior minister and then to the president; coordination efforts between the PSO and the NSB were unclear.</p><p>The Criminal Investigation Division reports to the Ministry of Interior and conducts most criminal investigations and arrests. The paramilitary Special Security Forces was under the authority of the interior minister, as was the counterterrorism unit. The Ministry of Defense supervised units to quell domestic unrest and to participate in internal armed conflicts. Civilian authorities did not maintain effective control over security forces. Houthis controlled most of the national security apparatus in sections of the north and some former state institutions. Competing tribal, party, and sectarian influences further reduced ROYG authority, exhibited in August when United Arab Emirates (UAE)-funded Security Belt Forces (SBF), many of which aligned with the secessionist Southern Transitional Council (STC), took over Aden and several other southern territories.</p><p>In 2014 the Houthi uprising compelled the ROYG to sign a UN-brokered peace deal calling for a “unity government.” The ROYG resigned after Houthi forces, allied with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh’s General People’s Congress (GPC) party, seized the presidential palace in 2015. Houthi forces then dissolved parliament, replacing it with the Supreme Revolutionary Committee. Hadi escaped house arrest and fled to Aden, where he declared all actions taken by Houthi forces in Sana’a unconstitutional, reaffirmed his position as president, pledged to uphold the principles of the 2014 National Dialogue Conference, and called on the international community to protect the country’s political process.</p><p>After Houthi forces launched an offensive in southern Yemen and entered Aden in 2015, Hadi fled to Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia formed a military coalition, Operation “Decisive Storm,” on behalf of the ROYG. Peace talks in Kuwait in 2016 between the Houthis and ROYG ended inconclusively. In 2017 Houthi forces killed Saleh after he publicly split from the Houthis and welcomed cooperation with the coalition. In December 2018 direct talks between the ROYG and Houthis under UN supervision in Sweden led to agreements on a ceasefire in and around the city and port of Hudaydah, as well as on prisoner exchanges and addressing the humanitarian situation in Taiz. These agreements were not effectively implemented; hostilities–including Houthi drone strikes and coalition airstrikes–continued throughout the year.</p><p>Significant human rights issues included: unlawful or arbitrary killings, including political assassinations; forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary arrest and detention; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners; arbitrary infringements on privacy rights; criminalization of libel, censorship, and site blocking; substantial interference with freedom of assembly and association; the inability of citizens to choose their government through free and fair elections; pervasive corruption; recruitment and use of child soldiers; pervasive abuse of migrants; and criminalization of consensual same sex sexual conduct between adults.</p><p>Impunity for security officials remained a problem, in part because the government exercised limited authority and in part due to the lack of effective mechanisms to investigate and prosecute abuse and corruption. The ROYG took steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, but had limited capacity due to the ongoing civil war. Houthi control over government institutions in the north severely reduced the ROYG’s capacity to conduct investigations.</p><p>Nonstate actors, including the Houthis, tribal militias, militant secessionist elements, al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and a local branch of ISIS committed significant abuses with impunity. Saudi-led coalition airstrikes resulted in civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/yemen/">https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/yemen/</a></span></p><p>My comment: By the US Dep. of State, but nevertheless seems to be better than could be expected. – The Houthis are no “non-state actors”.</p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>The role of Israel and UN in Saudi war of aggression against Yemen</p><p>The US, UK-backed neo-colonialist war against Yemen enters its fifth year. The Saudi alliance of aggression has pulverised entire swathes of Yemeni territory, decimated infrastructure, bombed hospitals into oblivion – all with armaments and weapons systems supplied by the UK/US military industrial complex.</p><p>Despite the illegitimacy of this aggression, NATO member states and UN agencies have done little more than to offer lip-service to the inevitable dire “humanitarian” consequences of such a punitive war that collectively targets the Yemeni people and popular resistance movement, standing firm against decades of corrupt and resource-plundering Saudi/US/UK coalition occupation.</p><p>Indeed, the UN ostensibly decries the starvation of children and widespread disease that thrives in the quagmire of Yemen’s war. However, <span><a href="https://21stcenturywire.com/2016/04/03/yemen-un-whitewashing-saudi-coalition-war-crimes-and-international-human-rights-violations/">the UN is complicit</a></span> in the collective punishment of the Yemeni people in its continued adherence to Resolution 2216 which is based entirely upon the legitimacy of fugitive President Mansour Hadi who not only resigned in early 2015 but eventually fled to Riyadh where he called upon the Saudi regime to bomb the Yemeni people into submission. The UN effectively maintains the sadistic “humanitarian” blockade and sanctions on the Yemeni people.</p><p>This hybrid war against Yemen is one of the worst crimes against humanity of our lifetime.</p><p>Recently, I had the privilege to meet with and interview the [Sanaa gov.] Yemeni Ambassador in Damascus, Naif Ahmed Al Qanes. I had the opportunity to ask a few questions that are rarely discussed in a compromised Western media cartel that, like the UN, effectively conceals the ugly underbelly of the UK/US proxy neo-colonialist project in Yemen. </p><p>My first question addressed the involvement of Israel in the war against Yemen. The Ambassador replied in depth:</p><p>Israel has been present since the first day of the aggression against Yemen. Israeli pilots participated directly in targeting Yemeni air-defences to disable them and prevent their use in resisting this aggression.</p><p>Israel’s involvement has been ongoing. Their military experts and pilots are an integral part of the UK/US-backed Saudi coalition. Israel actually lost a number of their pilots in the targeting of our airbase in Asir.</p><p>The focus of the Israeli decision makers, research centers and Zionist intelligence agencies is related to the southern section of the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb straits. After some degree of normalisation with the Gulf States, Israel maintains a historic enmity with Iran. Israel perceives the Ansarullah popular resistance movement to be a proxy of Iran and their control of the Bab El Mandeb straits is tantamount to a stranglehold over the Zionist regime – by Vanessa Beeley</p><p><span><a href="https://thewallwillfall.org/2020/03/11/the-role-of-israel-and-un-in-saudi-war-of-aggression-against-yemen/">https://thewallwillfall.org/2020/03/11/the-role-of-israel-and-un-in-saudi-war-of-aggression-against-yemen/</a></span></p><p>My remark: A clear pro-Houthi viewpoint.</p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p>US Aircraft Carrier Enters Red Sea for Allegations of Protection of International Navigation</p><p><span>The warship USS Dwight D.

Yemeni Women are no exception, yet they are able to find their strength.</p><p>Hunger is cruel to everyone, but it’s not completely blind. Women — especially in times of war — are more at risk to the suffering it bestows. They eat last and least and are often forced to drop out of school or marry early when there is not enough food.</p><p>Yemen is no exception, and as the nation’s conflict drags into its fifth year, women find themselves in increasingly difficult circumstances. But women are resilient, so despite the suffering, they find ways to remain hopeful and strong.</p><p>In Yemen, women and girls face challenges similar to women in any vulnerable country: pregnancy makes them more susceptible to malnutrition and their role as caregivers can make them overly sacrificial. But Yemen’s war has burdened them with additional ones as well. Fleeing violence, women have lost their communities and thus critical support systems, and too many girls have been forced to drop out of school because it is something their family can no longer afford.</p><p>Education upended</p><p>Hannan’s story exemplifies this problem. Hannan dropped out of school a year after the conflict started when she was just 14. War had made school unaffordable, so she stayed home to care for her siblings instead. Last year, aged 18, she got married.</p><p>WFP is working to make these stories less common by supporting school feeding programmes that help keep girls in school. The free snacks give parents incentive to send their children to school. WFP is currently expanding to reach 1.2 million kids across Yemen with daily nutritious snacks, and have just started a pilot programme to provide kids in school with sandwiches and fresh fruit.</p><p>The pilot, which was launched in Aden in February, employs women to make the sandwiches and sources all ingredients for the packed meals locally — giving markets a much-needed boost. Meanwhile, the sandwiches provide a child with about half of their daily calorie needs, making them hugely important in improving the nutrition of children. WFP plans to expand the programme to other parts of Yemen too.</p><p>A mother’s struggle</p><p>Among women, mothers are particular vulnerable to the hardships of war. Mothers are often more vulnerable to hunger because they sacrifice their share of food to ensure their children have enough. This can leave them at risk of malnutrition and if they are breastfeeding, they then often can’t produce enough milk for their babies.</p><p>In Yemen, sometimes even when mothers give up everything, they still can’t provide their families with enough — a burden that takes its toll. Nesreen lives with her husband and two children in Aden in a camp for internally displaced people (IDP). She receives monthly cash assistance from WFP, but recent price increases have left her struggling to buy enough food.</p><p>“When the prices increase, we skip meals. We cannot afford to have lunch and sometimes we do not have dinner,” said Nesreen.</p><p>Having enough to eat is critical for any child, but it’s especially important for children aged two and younger. Not having the right nutrients in the first 1,000 days can have a detrimental impact on the rest of their lives.</p><p>WFP runs nutrition centres across Yemen, providing around 3 million pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and children with special nutritional support to both treat and prevent malnutrition – by Annabel Symington</p><p><span><a href="https://insight.wfp.org/inside-the-lives-of-women-living-through-the-crisis-in-yemen-e45d5662972">https://insight.wfp.org/inside-the-lives-of-women-living-through-the-crisis-in-yemen-e45d5662972</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Yemen’s ‘Cash for Nutrition’ programme</p><p>With rising humanitarian needs, continued access challenges and funding shortfalls, national institutions are playing an increasingly important role in providing humanitarian aid. At the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 the long-standing divide between humanitarian and development interventions was challenged, with a call for new collective responses that both meet humanitarian needs and protect human and social capital. As the Yemen response shifts towards more protracted crisis programming, the need for a social protection system that provides a reliable, predictable, effective response to the country’s poorest and most vulnerable people is becoming increasingly urgent.</p><p>The Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project (ECRP) was the first World Bank project to test this approach before developing a full emergency response package. Approved in 2016, the ECRP works through UN agencies, national social protection institutions, the private sector and local communities. It is also increasingly driving transformational policy reform to improve nexus programming and build local governance capacity for social assistance delivery.</p><p>The Social Fund for Development ‘Cash for Nutrition’ intervention</p><p>One key Yemeni institution supported under the ECRP is the Social Fund for Development (SFD). Established in 1997, the SFD is a quasi-governmental organisation with a strong reputation as an independent and neutral actor able to operate across the country. Its objectives are to improve basic services, enhance economic opportunities and reduce the vulnerability of poor Yemenis through a community-led development approach.</p><p>Policy lessons for protracted crisis contexts</p><p>The conflict affected not only the welfare of the population being served by the ‘Cash for Nutrition’ programme, but also the implementation of the programme itself. The programme has reacted to the challenges presented by the security situation by becoming more flexible.</p><p>While conflict may destabilise markets and mean that in-kind aid delivery is preferable in the short term, in countries in protracted conflict cash transfers may often be feasible, reflecting the resilience of economic activity even in the face of increased transportation and transaction costs.</p><p>This study offers some important findings that further the evidence base on cash and nutrition programming. Compared to the conditional cash transfer programmes popular in development circles in stable countries, the ‘Cash for Nutrition’ programme demonstrated the effectiveness of a flexible approach labelled ‘soft conditionality’. </p><p>The success of the ‘Cash for Nutrition’ programme also highlights the importance of local institutions for sustainability – by Lamis Al-Iryani, Sikandra Kurdi, Sarah Palmer-Felgate</p><p><span><a href="https://odihpn.org/magazine/yemens-cash-for-nutrition-programme/">https://odihpn.org/magazine/yemens-cash-for-nutrition-programme/</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp4 Flüchtlinge / Refugees</span></h2><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Yemen: UNHCR Operational Update, 12 March 2020</span></p><p>As part of the emergency response in Marib, UNHCR through partner YARD distributed Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) kits consisting of food supplies, hygiene kits and dignity items, reaching a total of 1,241 internally displaced families.</p><p>The first round of cash assistance for IDPs is nearly complete.
