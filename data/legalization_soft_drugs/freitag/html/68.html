Beim Vorrücken stießen sie auf keinen Widerstand, da die Garde den Komplex kampflos geräumt hatte, wie einheimische Quellen berichteten. "Einige der Gardisten sind sogar zum STC übergelaufen." Präsident Abed Rabbo Mansur Hadi und die meisten seiner Minister arbeiten Berichten zufolge allerdings aus Riad in Saudi-Arabien.

"They want to keep the discussion in terms of the peace process to be limited to basically a coup discussion ... ignoring old grievances and what is happening in the south."</p><p>What will this lead to?</p><p>But Ramani, the researcher, said that in seizing Aden, the STC had made their presence indelible at any future peace initiative.</p><p>"Their indispensability would be guaranteed, and they could be invited to a UN peace settlement for the first time. This is an especially coveted goal after they were left out of the [December 2018] Stockholm agreement." </p><p>For Ramani, the STC considers dialogue with Saudi Arabia productive if Riyadh refrains from further military attacks. </p><p>"But if Saudi Arabia uses coercion to forces an STC withdrawal from Yemen, dialogue will likely break down." </p><p>Osama al-Rawhani, deputy executive director of The Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies, said this week's events in Aden are going "to represent a radical change in Yemen's conflict".</p><p>"It's adding different layers of complexity and it is very obvious how, starting from the coalition's position towards what happens in Aden, reflects the unclear intentions of Saudi's intervention in Yemen," he added.</p><p>"Now, the government which the Saudi claims to help regain its legitimacy has no capital," added al-Rawhani, calling for "clarity on what is next".</p><p>"Now, the STC has taken over Aden, who is going to run the country?" he asked.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/fighting-aden-key-questions-answered-190812115346659.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/fighting-aden-key-questions-answered-190812115346659.html</a></span></p><p><strong>(** A B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Preventing a Civil War within a Civil War in Yemen</strong></p><p>Fighting within the anti-Huthi front threatens to make an already multi-faceted conflict even more complex and intractable. Clashes in Aden reveal tensions within the Saudi-led coalition and highlight the pressing need to address Yemen’s “southern question” now rather than wait until a post-conflict political transition.</p><p>Clashes in the port city of Aden between secessionists and loyalists of the internationally recognised president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, threaten to tip southern Yemen into a civil war within a civil war. Such a conflict would deepen what is already the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and make a national political settlement harder to achieve. In the past, half-measures helped de-escalate simmering tensions in the south; today’s circumstances require robust diplomatic intervention from the UN, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to avoid the worst and help forge a durable solution.</p><p>The Huthis claimed responsibility for the strike. But members of the Southern Transitional Council (STC), secessionists who see themselves as a southern government-in-waiting and claim control of the Security Belts, blamed it on Islah, Yemen’s main Sunni Islamist political party, which is sometimes described – not entirely accurately – as “Yemen’s Muslim Brotherhood”. STC media outlets speculate that Islah and the Huthis are conspiring to destabilise the south together, despite the fact that they are on opposite sides of the wider war.</p><p>STC officials further claim that while they respect Hadi’s legitimacy, Islah members, whom they describe as terrorists, have infiltrated Hadi-aligned military forces, including the Presidential Guard, as well as other government institutions. The Presidential Guard is stationed at the presidential palace, near the location of al-Yafei’s funeral. After reports of gunshots directed at the mourners, STC-aligned fighters and Guardsmen exchanged fire at the palace entrance and near the airport. The STC claims that eleven of its members were killed. </p><p>The parties have issued a welter of statements that may seem contradictory. Bin Breik reaffirmed the STC’s affiliation with the Saudi-led coalition</p><p>Ahmed al-Maysari, the Hadi loyalist interior minister, claimed on 7 August that his forces had fended off a coup attempt and that the Saudi-led coalition continued to support the Hadi government. </p><p>Aden’s convoluted situation reflects the internal politics of Yemen’s anti-Huthi coalition, united against a common enemy but fragmented and lacking a shared identity. The Hadi government wishes to regain control of all Yemen. The STC, giving voice to southern grievances against perceived northern domination dating to the end of Yemen’s brief 1994 civil war, wants an independent south. Framing Islah and the Huthis as two sides of one “northern” coin, the STC alleges Islahi infiltration of the Hadi loyalists when in fact these forces are largely southerners only loosely allied with Islah. The group’s rhetoric is also likely designed to garner support from the UAE, which reviles the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p>South Yemen’s tangled politics, in turn, reveal the differing interests of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,</p><p>Saudi officials concede that the UAE and its southern allies have produced most of the war’s notable military successes, including the push toward the Red Sea port city of Hodeida in 2018. Yet some in Riyadh are nonetheless displeased by Abu Dhabi’s support for the STC, which they worry undermines Hadi and diverts attention from the fight against the Huthis.</p><p>The imperative of defeating the Huthis explains why the sides struck a balance in Aden,</p><p>At the moment, the balance of power on the ground appears to lie with the STC but outright victory is by no means assured for the secessionists. Both the STC and the Hadi government claim to have the upper hand militarily. While the STC has a larger number of affiliated forces in Aden and across the south, it is not clear that all its supporters will answer bin Breik’s call to overthrow the government.</p><p>Other southerners view the STC and especially its leadership as biased toward al-Dhale, a part of the south whose military forces were pitted against those from Abyan, President Hadi’s home governorate, in the brutal southern civil war of 1986. There are echoes of the past in today’s political alignments and fighting.</p><p>Full-fledged support from Abu Dhabi or Riyadh for either side could be a game changer. </p><p>For too long, Yemen’s southern question has been an afterthought for diplomats. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/preventing-civil-war-within-civil-war-yemen">https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/preventing-civil-war-within-civil-war-yemen</a></span> = <span><a href="https://lobelog.com/preventing-a-civil-war-within-a-civil-war-in-yemen/">https://lobelog.com/preventing-a-civil-war-within-a-civil-war-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B E P)</strong></p><p><strong>Oil’s Impact on Tensions in Southern Yemen</strong></p><p>Now, tensions between the Hadi government and the STC have come to a boiling point in Aden after Houthis’ successful attack on a military parade last week.</p><p>Such moves could reflect the balance of power in Yemen in a way that may radically alter the course of the war. The further extension of control by forces in southern Yemen will reinforce the secession movement there. The stakes are particularly high due to the Hadramout’s role in oil production—those who control the country's vital resources will have the most power to impose their political visions and goals.</p><p>The question of oil control has also impacted the recent history of Yemen all the way from the unification of North and South Yemen in 1990. A glance into this past suggests possible pathways and outcomes for what may shape up to be the most recent contest for the Hadramout’s resources.</p><p>The major revenue stream from Yemen’s oil—though primarily from the south—continued to secure loyalty to Saleh while motivating subsequent incursions into the south. In 2015, for example, Al-Qaeda controlled the coast of Hadramout, where the most important oil export outlet is located. Although the legitimate Yemeni government had announced that the production and export of oil has ceased for 18 months, <span><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/economy/2015/9/16/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%82-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%83%D9%84%D8%A7">news reports</a></span> indicated that al-Qaeda continued to market and sell oil in Mukalla. </p><p>According to the report, Al-Qaeda leaders had been in contact with local agents or ships at sea to complete deals. Other data <span>indicated</span> that the value of exports of crude petroleum in 2015 was $715 million and the value of petroleum gas exports was $715 million.</p><p>None of the previous reports and data mentioned who the agents are, but, <span><a href="https://lobelog.com/who-will-benefit-from-yemeni-oil-exports/">according to a similar report</a></span>, Ali Mohsin Al-Ahmar, current Vice-President, managed to push Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi aside and in 21014 negotiated energy contracts directly with China. Ali Mohsin's sons also acted as agents in Marib to sell Yemeni energy products. This leads to the belief that Al-Ahmar might have cooperated in making these deals, especially since Ali Mohsen is known to have a <span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/yemens-second-in-command-may-have-a-second-coming">relationship with extremist clerics</a></span> and militants who were tied to terrorist activity in Yemen.</p><p>However, oil production in Yemen overall has been declining due to the recent crisis. There are still significant reserves: according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).</p><p>Much of recent revenue goes to the pockets of influencers in both legitimate and illegitimate ways. For instance, in 2017, the executive director of <span><a href="http://www.sepocye.com/Arabic/">Safer</a></span>, a state-owned oil company, said that the security units responsible for protecting the oil fields in Marib—the region adjacent to Hadramout—were <span><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/economy/2017/6/11/%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A8-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%81-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9">stealing and looting oi</a></span>l. The company's chief executive pointed out the presence of military commanders behind these operations, and that the looted quantities were transferred to areas under the control of the Houthis. According to the same source, these oil tankers had been under the protection of the 107th Brigade, which is responsible for protecting oil in the "safer" area and receives salaries from the Yemeni government. And while the Masila basin in Hadramout, which holds 80 percent of Yemen’s oil reserves, is protected by military forces from Hadramout, Al-Ahmar controls the state-owned PetroMasila responsible for operating the Mesila oil fields.</p><p>provinces mirror microstates, including the Al-Mahra and Marib provinces, which refuse to supply revenue to the government. Hadramout has formed its own military forces, as did Shabwa and Aden with the support of the Arab alliance, especially the UAE. </p><p>The presence of local forces in Southern Yemen and the expanding powers of local governors increase the chances of southerners getting their demands, even independence.</p><p>Yet these ambitions are hampered by the region’s weighty economic value. The country's resources–most of them in Hadramout and Shabwa–remain in the hands of the government, military commanders, and powerful loyalists. These groups have strong ties with other parties to the conflict in Yemen–including the Islah party in some cases and al-Qaeda in others.</p><p>As the past few years demonstrate, within the conflict developing between the STC and Hadi’s government oil is likely to play a major role in the calculations of both parties. And in the upcoming months, these considerations are likely to continue shaping the political fate of Hadramout and the surrounding regions of South Yemen – by Muneer Binwaber </p><p><span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/oils-impact-on-tensions-in-southern-yemen">https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/oils-impact-on-tensions-in-southern-yemen</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>Proxy Conflict in Yemen and the Battle for Aden</p><p>The situation in Yemen continues to devolve into anarchy, with Emirati-trained forces battling troops from the Saudi-supported internationally recognized government.</p><p>Fighters from the Southern Transitional Council (STC), whose objective is to secede from Yemen, seized control of military bases and government installations in Aden, one of the most important cities in the country. </p><p>The splintering of the Saudi- and Emirati- supported force reflects a broader divergence of interests between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, although talks are ongoing to forge consensus in Yemen.</p><p>For years, the international community has pushed for a negotiated settlement in Yemen without success and the country continues to slide toward collapse.</p><p><span><a href="http://www.soufangroup.com/intelbrief-proxy-conflict-in-yemen-and-the-battle-for-aden/">http://www.soufangroup.com/intelbrief-proxy-conflict-in-yemen-and-the-battle-for-aden/</a></span><span> = <a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/soufan-center/proxy-conflict-in-yemen-and-the-battle-for-aden">https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/soufan-center/proxy-conflict-in-yemen-and-the-battle-for-aden</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Films: The Heat: Yemen crisis</strong></p><p>Yemeni separatists take control of the strategic city of Aden, just weeks after the UAE says it’s pulling its forces out of the country.

The separatists, which have strong control of the South, claimed that the Yemeni government is targeting their leadership after exploiting their forces in the fight against the Houthis and al-Qaeda, while the Saudi-backed government blamed the escalation on the UAE due to its support for the secessionists. In response, Saudi Arabia targeted separatists in Aden on Sunday and re-emphasized its commitment to the Yemeni government. However, the Saudis’ offer to mediate the southern conflict is raising alarm bells across Yemen, as any attempt to recognize the STC will be detrimental to Yemen’s government.</p><p>Notably, the STC has been careful not to ruffle any feathers with the Saudis as it needs their support for its secessionist project.

Besides further complicating the country's multi-dimensional war, it could have far-reaching effects on the eventual outcome. </p><p>Firstly, it is a major blow to the already fragile credibility of the government headed by Abd Rabbou Mansour Hadi and to the Saudi-led coalition which supports him as Yemen's "legitimate" president.</p><p>Whether independence would be a good idea is debatable to say the least and it has minimal support at an international level. So far, the "southern question" has not been viewed as a priority and the general approach has been to keep it on the sidelines pending a solution of more urgent problems.</p><p>Saturday's events look set to change this. If the separatists can maintain their hold on Aden the "southern question" will become impossible to ignore – and that appears to have been the primary objective.</p><p>In <span><a href="https://al-bab.com/blog/2019/08/houthis-foes-fight-amongst-themselves-yemen#stc">a letter</a></span> to the UN Security Council last week the STC made three specific demands:</p><ol><li>"Credible southern representation" in the political process towards ending the overall conflict.<br /> 2. A sustainable political solution for southern Yemen, including a process for self- determination.<br /> 3. More international aid for the south.</li> </ol><p>One problem with placating the southern separatists is that it could make a political solution for the whole of Yemen more difficult.

"Yesterday we treated a woman who had a bullet wound and she was eight months pregnant. At least five people were dead on arrival at the hospital, one of them a child." Sixty-two of the people treated by MSF required emergency inpatient care.</p><p>"The city’s a battlefield. We can hear the sound of heavy weapon fire and tanks are moving around the streets," Seguin said. “Our hospital is stretched to the limit. Our teams are working around the clock to take care of the many people wounded by the fighting, and we can’t get anyone in to replace them. The city’s paralyzed and some personnel aren’t able to get to the hospital because the fighting’s really fierce and the roads into the city are cut off. Given all of this, we’re worried we won’t be able to get supplies through to the hospital."</p><p>The fighting also threatens the port of Aden, the only fully functional port in the country, through which imported goods and some humanitarian aid—including MSF’s supplies—are brought into Yemen.</p><p>"If the situation continues to deteriorate...there’s also a risk of prices being impacted and, consequently, people’s access to basic essentials when there’s already inflation," said Seguin.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/yemen-msfs-hospital-aden-overwhelmed-influx-patients-wounded-intense">https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/yemen-msfs-hospital-aden-overwhelmed-influx-patients-wounded-intense</a></span></p><p>(* A P)</p><p>Two hundred thousand civilians directly threatened by militia infighting in Aden</p><p>District of Crater launches distress call to Red Cross</p><p>Hundreds of families have been trapped in the Aden district of Crater for days now, with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) launching a distress call.</p><p>Citizens of Crater have launched appeals to the International Red Cross to get them out of the city.</p><p>They said that they had been trapped for four days in the Jabal al-Badari area overlooking the water foundation and the Qatiee area, and could not get out of their homes because of the clashes between Saudi-backed and UAE-backed mercenaries.</p><p>The warring parties reportedly refuse to provide safe passage for the displaced civilians, they said.</p><p>In the distress call, the civilians confirmed that their stock of water and food has run out, and that quick movements must be made in order to save them.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.uprising.today/two-hundred-thousand-civilians-directly-threatened-by-militia-infighting-in-aden/">https://www.uprising.today/two-hundred-thousand-civilians-directly-threatened-by-militia-infighting-in-aden/</a></span></p><p><span>(* A P)</span></p><p><span>Film: C</span>ontinued Clashes Cause Shops To Close As Well As the Main Streets of Aden</p><p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GziDTPmjMM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GziDTPmjMM</a></span></p><p><span>(* A P)</span></p><p>CLASHES BETWEEN SAUDI-BACKED AND UAE-BACKED FORCES RAGING IN ADEN (MAP UPDATE)</p><p><span><a href="https://southfront.org/clashes-between-saudi-backed-and-uae-backed-forces-raging-in-aden-map-update/">https://southfront.org/clashes-between-saudi-backed-and-uae-backed-forces-raging-in-aden-map-update/</a></span></p><p><span>(* A P)</span></p><p>Southern Yemen separatists seize government camps in Aden</p><p>Yemen’s southern separatists took control of all government military camps in Aden on Saturday, an official said, as fighting raged between nominal allies who have turned on each other, complicating U.N. efforts to end a devastating war.</p><p><span>Battles had resumed at dawn, marking a fourth straight day of clashes between the separatists and government forces in the port city that is temporarily hosting Yemen’s internationally-recognized authorities.</span></p><p>Saturday’s clashes initially centered on the all-but empty presidential palace in the predominantly residential Crater district, near Aden International Airport and in a neighborhood where Interior Minister Ahmed al-Mayssari lives, residents said.</p><p>The separatists also took over his house, which he had already vacated, officials said.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/southern-yemen-separatists-seize-government-camps-in-aden-idUSKCN1V007B">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/southern-yemen-separatists-seize-government-camps-in-aden-idUSKCN1V007B</a></span></p><p>and also <span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7344097/Southern-separatists-overrun-barracks-Yemens-Aden.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7344097/Southern-separatists-overrun-barracks-Yemens-Aden.html</a></span></p><p><span>Films: </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1cMKSoK_v4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1cMKSoK_v4</a></span></p><p>(A P)</p><p><span>Not to the surprise of anyone, </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hashtag_click">#Yemen</a></span><span>’s President did not even bother to address his people despite the raging war that’s been ongoing for days in Aden.

Therefore, the southern transitional council is assuming its responsibilities delegated by the people as the council tried to drive these governments to assume their responsibilities but in vain.</p><p>Unfortunately, these governments continued their conspiracies against our southern people as they surrendered battel fronts on the southern borders to Al-Houthis, giving them the chance to return to the south, in addition to using live bullets against our unarmed citizens during the funeral of martyrs of Al-Gala Camp terrorist Attack, Brigadier Muneer Mahmoud (Abu Yamama) and his companions.</p><p>For these reasons, the council’s presidency decided the following:</p><p>First: Declaring general mobilization among the people and southern resistance forces to go to Maasheek and dismiss this terrorist and corrupt government loyal to Al-Eslah terrorist party and to end its crimes against our people. At the same time we assert the legitimacy of president Hady and to help this legitimacy to get rid of Al-Eslah party domination.</p><p>Second: The council asserts partnership with the Arab Coalition led by Saudi Arabia and UAE in their war against Iranian agenda in the region represented in Al-Houthi expansion, in addition partnership with the international society in war against terrorism.</p><p>Third: The council demands all military and security personnel of the south to stand with the southern cause and southern rights and not to be against this right under any conditions.</p><p>Fourth: The council demands all governors, police chiefs and directors of public facilities in all southern governorates to resume their tasks effectively in their geographic domains and to face all types of corruption as those who will fail will be questioned by the people.</p><p>Fifth: The council asserts the protection of lives and properties of northern citizens residing in the south without any breach for southern security or stability.</p><p>Sixth: the council asserts that the south is for all southern and under these critical conditions we should lineup to avoid the conspiracies of those who intend harm to us and to our cause.</p><p>Mercy for Martyrs, quick healing for the injured and dignity for our southern people</p><p><span><a href="https://en.smanews.org/southern-transitional-council-issues-a-statement-concerning-assaults-of-yemeni-government-forces-on-unarmed-citizens-in-aden">https://en.smanews.org/southern-transitional-council-issues-a-statement-concerning-assaults-of-yemeni-government-forces-on-unarmed-citizens-in-aden</a></span></p><p>My comment: This is calling for a coup.</p><p><strong>(** A P)</strong></p><p><strong>Statement of the Southern Public Uprising in Aden</strong></p><p>Our southern people and its political and military leaderships proved their good will through supporting the efforts of our brothers in the Arab Coalition to fight for the Arabic agenda, end Al-Houthi coup and restore the legitimate authority of the Yemeni government in Sanaa. For all that, we sacrificed thousands of martyrs. But ground facts indicate that this government is only fighting the south, its people and its figures in a vicious unhuman war. <br /> In that war, the south sacrificed noble martyrs, the last of them was brigadier Muneer Mahmoud Al-Yafaie (Abu Yamama) and his companions, who martyred in two mean terrorist attacks by Al-Houthis, ISIS and Muslim Brotherhood government. They all collaborated in this crime that shook the whole south. <br /> This war exposed conspiracies of the Yemeni government against the south that hosted it generously in Aden. The government works effortlessly on destroying our homelands, denying us our rights and starving our people. <br /> If this government is to remain, this means that all terrorist groups and militias will be supported by this government to spread chaos and jeopardize the victories we achieved by the hands of our brave resistance. This government works only on paving the way to reoccupy the south through its agents and terrorists who come to the south under different descriptions just to enable occupation to return. Therefore, our people, in this critical moment of our history, will take decisions that preserve our history, national identity and dignity. The crowds demand the following: <br /> This government should leave Aden and the whole south immediately <br /> President Hady and the Arab Coalition are required to transfer full authority peacefully to the southern people and enable them, through the Southern Transitional Council, their delegated representative, to exercises administration of our lands and fortunes without delay as we will not accept anything but our demands. <br /> Evacuating all northern military unites stationed in the south and sending them to battel fronts against Al-Houthis in the north. <br /> Activating the agreement of the tripartite committee (president Hady and the Arab Coalition) indicating that all military camps should get out of Aden and sent to battel fronts, except for Backup and Support troops that will remain to keep law and order as agreed. <br /> All southern officials, political figures, military personnel, civilian administrators and diplomats who work for the government are demanded to be at the side of their people and to achieve the people’s demands as this critical moment needs all efforts. <br /> The southern people have sovereignty over his entire national soil as the people is the source of all powers. We assert our rightful demands of independence and restoring our federal state according to the international borders of pre- May 21st, 1990.</p><p><span><a href="https://en.smanews.org/statement-of-the-southern-public-uprising-in-aden">https://en.smanews.org/statement-of-the-southern-public-uprising-in-aden</a></span></p><p>(A P)</p><p>Commander of Abian Security Belt: “It Is Time to Listen to the Will of Our Patient Southern People”</p><p>Our decision is clear and final.

Since August 7, fighting has intensified in parts of the city leaving civilians trapped in residential areas especially in the Crater area. Scared residents are unable to flee to get to safety and many are running out of food and water. One of the city’s main water tanks has reportedly been damaged by the fighting, cutting off supplies of drinking water. “There has been heavy, continuous shelling. We’re still hearing clashes in my neighbourhood. The water supply has stopped for days. People have small water tanks with enough water to last for one or two day’s maximum. There isn’t enough water and this is one of the main concerns. There is no way to get out of the city. Roads are closed and it is not safe. People are scared. We hope this will end soon,” says Amgad, NRC staff member.</p><p>The fighting is taking place in densely-populated residential areas and civilians are caught in the crossfire, with residents at threat from indirect fire from heavy weapons. </p><p>NRC currently has nine Yemeni staff members who are trapped by the fighting in the Crater area. We are extremely worried about their safety and well-being. Our staff are trapped in their homes.</p><p>If the fighting continues the impact will be felt across the country.
