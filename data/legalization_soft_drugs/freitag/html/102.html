The Saudi-led coalition’s bombing campaign in Yemen is now the subject of a major Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigation by <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/">Bellingcat</a>, an investigative journalism organisation. The fruits of this investigation, released in a dedicated <a href="https://yemen.bellingcat.com/">website</a>, provide insight into bombing patterns. These bombings, alongside the blockade on the ports of Aden and Al-Hudaydah and ground operations, have often caused grave harm to civilians, including the destruction of essential civilian infrastructure and specially protected objects. They also raise serious questions about compliance with international humanitarian law (IHL), as recently highlighted in the September 3 <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/GEE-Yemen/A_HRC_42_CRP_1.PDF">Report</a> of the Group of Eminent International and Regional Experts on Yemen (Group of Experts), released by the UN Human Rights Council, which found an array of violations by all parties to the conflict in Yemen.</p><p>The Bellingcat investigation can contribute to the legal analysis of the Saudi-led coalition’s air war, allowing a granular analysis of practices that have been alleged to be unlawful. The evolving scale of the analyses, as more are released over time, may be unprecedented. Yet even with access to more post-strike information than has been available to researchers, legal experts, and NGOs in previous (and especially ongoing) armed conflicts, questions remain regarding how those outside government can “prove” violations of the law of armed conflict. Below is an initial reflection on the legal significance of this investigation, in anticipation of a methodical engagement in the coming year by the <a href="https://www.glanlaw.org/">Global Legal Action Network (GLAN)</a>, of which I am a co-founder.</p><p>In an era of sophisticated misinformation, there are good reasons to be skeptical, even wary, of intelligence gathered from publicly available sources. Its many sources, which include images and videos released by news agencies as well as those uploaded by individuals, vary in reliability. While satellite imagery, image quality permitting, is a generally accepted as reliable public source of visual information, “user-generated content” (UGC) includes videos and photographs uploaded by unknown, and potentially partisan, sources. Only a rigorous methodology of discovery and verification, including a replicable analysis whose steps can be retraced by any person, can ensure UGC’s reliability and inferential value.</p><p>Moreover, OSINT should not be perceived as substituting for primary evidence: witness testimony, bomb fragments, verified photographs and videos of the scene received from witnesses. In addition, OSINT’s revelatory effect should not be seen to travel the physical and moral distance between the technologically equipped investigator and the theatre of war. It can be tempting, but it would be presumptuous, to think one can fully know the conflict reality through the use of technologically advanced tools.</p><p>With these limitations in mind, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/09/digitally-dissecting-atrocities-amnesty-internationals-open-source-investigations/">NGOs</a> and UN fact-finding missions have been using OSINT in their research for some years</p><p>Through OSINT methodologies, we have more evidence of the conduct of hostilities during an ongoing conflict than at any time in modern history. OSINT may constitute a distinct and important evolution in the methods and actors involved in the collection of evidence. It can excavate a treasure trove of visual data. </p><p>The Limits of OSINT and the Law’s Thresholds</p><p>So we know that air strikes have struck locations at times when large numbers of civilians congregate. We know that they led to massive casualties. We know that the official coalition position, and its purportedly objective investigative unit, sometimes provide erroneous accounts of these same strikes (or in some cases deny that they occurred at all). This may be enough to convince an objective lay observer that civilians and civilian objects were targeted, that the law of armed conflict has been violated, that the violations are serious, and that they may be attributable to decision makers at different levels of the command structure, who may be individually liable. It will be frustrating for those observers, whose good faith and judgement should not be easily dismissed, that, in fact, even the most rigorously-analysed and revelatory analysis derived from OSINT will find it very difficult to meet the law’s thresholds.</p><p>In order to find a violation of the fundamental principle of <span><a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/470-750061?OpenDocument">distinction</a></span> between military and civilian objects, which prohibits launching an attack directed against civilians or civilian objects, at both the level required for a violation of IHL and, even more so, at the level of a war crime, access to information that cannot be adduced through OSINT may be necessary. Especially in the case of aerial bombardment, the distance between the action and its consequences seems to weaken the capacity to draw reasonable inference from the observable results.</p><p>Conclusion: Reasons to Further Engage OSINT</p><p>Extensive and rigorous OSINT analysed by non-governmental actors (be they journalists, committees of experts associated with intergovernmental bodies or NGOs) aims to identify, describe, visualize, and present the facts – in this instance related to air strikes in the conflict in Yemen. This rich factual data provides an unprecedented opportunity for applied and more precise analysis of the legality of the conduct of hostilities of a particular party to the conflict.</p><p>One may still feel, however, a sense of frustration that an exhaustive presentation of an air strike leading to extensive civilian casualties still does not yield a clear legal finding of an IHL violation (or war crime). This is an invitation to do two things: first, to identify ways in which OSINT can be further improved to illuminate and identify legally salient factors, painting a fuller, more granular, and more authoritative picture of the circumstances in which the attack came about and the attacker’s decision making; and second, to consider the ways in which the infamous indeterminacy of the law of war continues to serve, from the construction of fundamental principles to the establishment of individual liability, the privileged position of the attacking party, as long as its decision-making process is supported by even a veneer of military professionalism – by Ioannis Kalpouzos</p><p><span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/66258/the-yemen-project-open-source-investigations-and-the-law-of-war/">https://www.justsecurity.org/66258/the-yemen-project-open-source-investigations-and-the-law-of-war/</a></span></p><p>my comment: This seems to be frustrating, but it’s hardly acceptable. Impunity for documented war crimes is not acceptable.</p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia won’t attack Iran.

Buying the weapons, rather than deploying them, is the point. These multimillion-dollar purchases maintain commercial relations with western allies from whom it imports arms, and who in return turn a blind eye to Saudi’s human rights abuses, assassinations and kidnappings, because there is too much money at stake. Saudi Arabia’s entire foreign policy model is based on using its wealth to buy friends and silence.</p><p>And so Saudi must continue to play on US fears about Iran, ensuring that its bodyguard is always <span><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/15/trump-locked-loaded-iran-saudi-arabia-1497452">“locked and loaded”</a></span>, as Trump stated in a sabre-rattling tweet after the drone strikes. </p><p>Bellicose in the extreme, and yet aware that it is highly unlikely to suffer the consequences of its pugnaciousness, Saudi is currently locked in escalating conflicts with Iran, <span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/qatari-saudi-arabia-border-why-so-serious-2019-7?r=US&amp;IR=T">Qatar</a></span> and Yemen, propping up military regimes in <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/03/sudanese-crackdown-comes-after-talks-with-egypt-and-saudis">Sudan</a></span> and <span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-saudi-islands/egypts-top-court-waives-legal-challenges-to-red-sea-islands-transfer-to-saudi-idUSKCN1GF0HP">Egypt</a></span>, messily meddling in Lebanon, and continuing to fund random Sunni hardline endeavours all over the world – and generally getting away with it.

The expert report answers this question</strong></p><p>Investigations have been provided by prominent foreign newspapers over the past period, indicating the involvement of the UAE and its local arms in Aden in carrying out and managing the wave of assassinations that have taken place in the southern Yemeni city of Aden since it was liberated from Houthi militias in the second half of 2015.</p><p>It did not stop there, but those accused of participating in the carry-out of assassinations who were arrested made confessions in the prosecution confirming the involvement of transitional leader Hani Ben Brik and the UAE behind them in assassinations of religious, political and military figures in Aden.</p><p>Recently, the experts' report confirmed the involvement of the UAE and the system of local armed figures and formations in carrying out assassinations and the report stopped long when the assassination of General Jaafar Mohammed Saad, former governor of Aden, which was the beginning of a series of assassinations witnessed in the city during the next three years.</p><p>The report of leading experts said it investigated the killings and murders of 90 southern resistance leaders, prominent government officials, clerics and scholars in the southern Yemeni city of Aden between October 2015 and May 2019.</p><p>The report, which is being considered by the Human Rights Council at its current session, added that all the cases investigated were targeted at critics of the United Arab Emirates and the southern secessionist movement supported by it and they openly supported the legitimate government.</p><p>The first assassination and liquidation in Aden took place in December 2015, shortly after the city was liberated from Houthi militias, where Aden's governor, Maj. Gen. Jaafar Mohammed Saad, was assassinated, the report said.</p><p>The expert said that of The Islamic State claimed responsibility for Saad's assassination, but the report said the real killers were not yet identified.</p><p>The report pointed out that the assassination of Jaafar Saad came after the selection of Aydros Zubaidi for the post of governor of Aden in a consensus between the president and the UAE, adding that "Jaafar Saad was replaced by Governor Aydros Zubaidi, who was already chosen for this position before Jaafar's death."</p><p>The report confirmed that the group of experts conducted 48 interviews, 33 of them with victims and witnesses, as well as eight secondary sources and interviewed 3 witnesses who were former members of the security belt or resistance, whom the UAE tried to pressure to carry out assassinations on its behalf, as well as interviews conducted by the expert group with five victims threatened with death by the parties concerned.</p><p>The Panel of Experts verified 78 separate evidences, including location, photographic evidence and documents, as well as open source materials, reports, videos, recordings, writings, as well as video recordings of relevant public statements and other written public statements made by the STC Southern and command the security belt. the Panel also received evidence of a number of assassination attempts and threats."</p><p>He noted the involvement of the southern transitional and Emirati leaders in the assassinations of 90 prominent figures in Aden, the assassination of Jaafar Saad was the beginning of a series of assassinations that opened the way for the UAE and separatists to take control of Aden and other neighboring areas, according to the report.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that Aydros Zubaidi, after his dismissal from his post as governor of Aden, announced the formation of the Transitional Council with Hani Ben Brik</p><p><span><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/171836">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/171836</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P T)</strong></p><p><strong>How the Government’s Ties with Islamist Groups Affects Yemen’s Unity and Stability</strong></p><p>Terrorist groups have been present in Yemen since the beginning of the 1990s, the same period that Abdullah Ibn Husayn al-Ahmar founded Al-Islah, the Yemeni branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. These were the first years of unity between the old North and South Yemen. Southerners had many concerns about integration, related to issues of tribalism, sectarianism, and religious extremism. Although the Yemeni Socialist Party, the ruling party in South Yemen before the unification in 1990, welcomed the Islah Party, it did so only after Islah ceased describing this Communist outfit as a party as “infidels”.</p><p>The civil war in Yemen in 1994 came about after southerners’ felt their fears and suspicions had been vindicated; they were not equal partners in a union but an occupied area. The North’s victory provided space to terrorist groups and Islamist elements like the Islah Party to pursue the rejectionist course. Recently, southerners have been fighting a battle similar to the war of 1994, and there are growing fears that terrorist groups and their allies might exploit the situation again.</p><p>The Roots and Influence of the Islah Party in Yemen</p><p>Al-Islah was founded only a few months after the declaration of Yemeni unification in 1990. Islah represented tribal and religious interests, rather than strictly political ones. The Islah founder, Abdullah Ibn Husayn al-Ahmar, was the shaykh of the Hashid tribal federation.</p><p>Therefore, when the Islah party emerged, Saleh made it into an ally of his General People’s Congress (GPC) party, rather than allowing it to become an opposition party. Islah’s rapport with the Yemeni ruling party and its religious hostility to the Socialist Party fueled tension between all these parties and accelerated the conflict that ultimately led to the war in 1994. As a result of Saleh’s victory in the war, Islah’s influence in Yemen’s administration has grown.</p><p>The Interrelation of State and Islamists in Yemen</p><p>Despite serious disagreements over tactics and strategy between the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Qaeda, there is an essential commonality in ideology. According to the <span><a href="https://www.counterextremism.com/content/muslim-brotherhood%E2%80%99s-ties-isis-and-al-qaeda">Counter Extremism Project</a></span>, these similarities increase the likelihood of cooperation between the two organizations.

Klar ist der Drohnenangriff auf die Anlagen des größten Ölexporteurs der Welt zu verurteilen. Ohne Frage. Der wirtschaftliche Schaden soll enorm sein. Dass dadurch das teuerste Unternehmen der Welt, die staatliche Ölfördergesellschaft Aramco, weniger Wert sein wird, ist nicht zu vermeiden.

Der verantwortliche Offizier dürfte allerdings Glück haben, wenn er mit dem Leben davonkommt, wie ein amerikanischer Militärfachmann anmerkte.</p><p>Doch unabhängig davon, woher die Raketen kamen und ob wirklich Iran sie angeordnet hat – für Saudi-Arabien ist asymmetrischer Krieg eigentlich nichts Neues.

Doch genau darin liegt das Problem: Gegen derartige Angriffe mögen die Saudis sich verteidigen können, nicht aber gegen tieffliegende Drohnen und Marschflugkörper ohne vorhersehbare Flugbahn. Die bleiben buchstäblich unter dem Radar. Erst wenn sie über dem Horizont auftauchen, werden sie sichtbar – doch dann ist es meistens schon zu spät, um zu reagieren.</p><p>Auf solche Angriffe waren die Saudis schlicht nicht vorbereitet.

This is reminiscent of the claims that one of the 9/11 hijackers’ passports survived the attack on the World Trade Centre.</p><p>What the Saudis did state, though, was that 18 drones were launched against the Abqaiq oil facility and seven cruise missiles targeted the Khurais oil fields, three of which fell short. Satellite images provided by the US government of the attack sites revealed at least 17 separate impact points.</p><p>However, this is not sufficient evidence that the attacks came from Iranian territory. Retired General Mark Hertling told CNN that the images “really don’t show anything, other than pretty good accuracy on the strike of the oil tanks.”</p><p>Furthermore, the evidence made public does not suggest that the attacks came from the north or north-west (which would have us believe that the source was either Iran-aligned Iraqi territory or from <span><a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-aramco/saudi-oil-attacks-came-from-southwest-iran-u-s-official-says-raising-tensions-idUKKBN1W2187">south-west Iran</a></span>, which would be north-east of the attack sites). They also do not point to the south, which would be the most likely trail leading to the Houthis in Yemen.</p><p>It appears more likely that the <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/16/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-oil-attack.html">targets were struck from the west</a></span> when one looks at the close-up images of the tanks from the Abqaiq facility against the arrow indicating due north. This may corroborate an announcement by Houthi spokesman Saree following the attack, that after careful intelligence gathering and monitoring, it was implemented with “the cooperation of honourable and free men within the Kingdom”, a likely reference to the 15-20 per cent of the population who form the Saudi Shia community concentrated mainly in the oil rich but socio-economically deprived east of the country.</p><p>Dr Stephen Byren, writing in the <span><a href="https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/09/article/how-iran-precisely-targeted-saudi-oil-facilities/">Asia Times</a></span>, is of the opinion that the Houthis did not carry out the attack, but he certainly believes that, “Saudi Arabia was infiltrated by well-trained operators who were close to the targets and were able to guide the terminal phase of the attacking cruise missiles (and maybe the drones) via video transmitted from the missiles and drones.”</p><p>This theory adds credence to the idea of local involvement. Arguably, the targets were carefully selected. With regard to the Abqaiq oil processing plant, at least 11 of the 17 points of impact were tanks containing liquid gas; the piping, <span><a href="https://www.moonofalabama.org/2019/09/damage-at-saudi-oil-plant-points-to-well-targeted-swarm-attack.html">it has been suggested</a></span>, was configured such that any damage to one or a group of tanks, would not affect the overall production process, as it would simply be re-routed to the next tank. However, with all tanks in this particular area being taken out, production was interrupted. “The targeting for this attack was done with detailed knowledge of the process and its dependencies… they may have been launched from within Saudi Arabia.”</p><p>This is not to say that Iran did not have a rational motive to carry out the attack. </p><p><span>I</span>t is their advanced weaponry and defence systems that the Saudis are ultimately employing and relying upon for their state security. The Gulf, after all, is one of the most monitored areas in the world, with US-supplied radar systems and missiles facing Iran, not only in Saudi territory, but also in other Gulf neighbours and on US ships fitted with Aegis air ballistic defence systems. If true, this attack exposes the failure of the US defence systems as deployed there.</p><p>The question that must be asked is this: how were almost two dozen missiles and drones not detected, especially if they came from Iran? A former US Navy officer who has experience in the region told <span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-account-saudi-attack-embarrassing-failure-2019-9?r=US&amp;IR=T">Business Insider</a></span>, “It’s very hard to imagine a salvo of 17 shots from Iranian territory not being picked up via some land and sea radars.”</p><p>If there is concrete evidence of Iranian involvement, it should be available from US radar data gathered in the Gulf. A NATO military official posted to Saudi Arabia acknowledged that such data can be obtained easily if the US wanted it, but, “If they haven’t released that info, it’s because either they don’t have it or the Saudis asked for a delay for domestic political reasons.”</p><p>Although, as the <span><a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2019/09/19/saudis-couldnt-stop-attack-on-oil-facilities-even-with-top-us-defenses/">Military Times</a></span> points out, the multitude of US made Patriot air defences in Saudi’s arsenal “are meant to shoot down hostile aircraft or shorter-range ballistic missiles. Patriots provide ‘point defence’ — not protection of wide swaths of territory — and it’s unclear whether any were positioned close to the oil sites.”</p><p>In spite of the billions which Saudi Arabia has spent on US-made defence systems, and its reliance on US intelligence, the US does not have “an unblinking eye over the entire Middle East at all times,” said Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p>Whoever was behind the attack, the truth is that the balance of power has changed with the human costs in Yemen pitted against the economic and political costs of the war for the Saudis.</p><p>The Yemenis, of course, are within their right under international law to defend themselves against foreign aggression. In their eyes, an attack on an oil producing facility that contributes to the Saudi war machine — which has included 17,000 air raids and the dropping of 50,000 bombs, many on non-military targets — is entirely legitimate.</p><p>The fact that the drones were Iranian made or supplied should not be a reason to go to war with Iran. After all, Tehran has merely done the same as Washington by supplying arms to one of the belligerents in the conflict.</p><p>Avoiding war with Iran becomes increasingly difficult, however, when there are policymakers intent on justifying military action, especially without providing credible, concrete evidence.

They face a dilemma of whether and how to respond, given the risk of starting a chain reaction that puts the Gulf at the forefront of targets for counterattack and sets the region on fire, potentially drawing in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Israel.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/saudi-arabia/after-aramco-attack-middle-east-one-step-closer-its-1914-moment?utm_source=Sign+Up+to+Crisis+Group%27s+Email+Updates&amp;utm_campaign=589dd951bd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_09_20_10_43&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_1dab8c11ea-589dd951bd-359782889#iran">Iran</a></span> – by Ali Vaez and Naysan Rafati</p><p><span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/saudi-arabia/after-aramco-attack-middle-east-one-step-closer-its-1914-moment?utm_source=Sign+Up+to+Crisis+Group%27s+Email+Updates&amp;utm_campaign=589dd951bd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_09_20_10_43&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_1dab8c11ea-589dd951bd-359782889#iraq">Iraq</a></span> – by Maria Fantappie</p><p><span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/saudi-arabia/after-aramco-attack-middle-east-one-step-closer-its-1914-moment?utm_source=Sign+Up+to+Crisis+Group%27s+Email+Updates&amp;utm_campaign=589dd951bd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_09_20_10_43&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_1dab8c11ea-589dd951bd-359782889#gulf">Gulf</a></span> – by Elizabeth Dickinson</p><p><span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/saudi-arabia/after-aramco-attack-middle-east-one-step-closer-its-1914-moment?utm_source=Sign+Up+to+Crisis+Group%27s+Email+Updates&amp;utm_campaign=589dd951bd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_09_20_10_43&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_1dab8c11ea-589dd951bd-359782889#yemen">Yemen</a></span> – by Peter Salisbury</p><p><span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/saudi-arabia/after-aramco-attack-middle-east-one-step-closer-its-1914-moment?utm_source=Sign+Up+to+Crisis+Group%27s+Email+Updates&amp;utm_campaign=589dd951bd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_09_20_10_43&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_1dab8c11ea-589dd951bd-359782889#us">United States</a></span> – by Daniel Schneiderman</p><p><span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/saudi-arabia/after-aramco-attack-middle-east-one-step-closer-its-1914-moment?utm_source=Sign+Up+to+Crisis+Group%27s+Email+Updates&amp;utm_campaign=589dd951bd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_09_20_10_43&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_1dab8c11ea-589dd951bd-359782889#oz">Israel</a></span> – by Ofer Zalzberg</p><p>Yemen</p><p>From the very beginning, Yemen’s Huthi movement (who call themselves Ansar Allah) has claimed responsibility for the attacks on Khurais and Abqaiq. The group justifies these attacks as a response to what it describes as Saudi Arabia’s siege of Yemen by land, air and sea, as well as four and a half years of Saudi-led bombardment that have caused thousands of civilian casualties and massive destruction. They reject U.S. claims that they lack the technical sophistication required to launch such an operation, pointing to the long-range drones they unveiled earlier this year, which they say are home-made.</p><p>Senior Huthi leaders have threatened for some time to launch more effective and sophisticated assaults on Saudi Arabia’s oil and transport infrastructure. They say attacks will continue until the Saudis agree to direct talks with them and the Sanaa-based government and to mutual de-escalation. They accuse the internationally recognised government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi of being little more than a front for Saudi and U.S. interests that is hence unable to negotiate a settlement of Yemen’s war. They may now be tempted to launch a strike that clearly originates from Yemen in an attempt to show that they have the capacity to hit deep in Saudi Arabia and with accuracy. Some in the movement believe a regional conflagration would work to their advantage, drawing Saudi and U.S. attention away from the war in Yemen and giving Saudi Arabia reason to quickly end the war on its southern flank so that it can focus on other fronts. Yet many others want to avoid this outcome, not least because they worry it could bring new levels of destruction.</p><p>The Huthis’ Yemeni critics say it is the northern rebels who are a front for external interests, namely the Islamic Republic’s, pointing to their immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks as proof of close coordination between the movement and its purported Iranian handlers.</p><p>Regardless of the provenance of the attacks, the risks for Yemen are clear. <span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/203-saving-stockholm-agreement-and-averting-regional-conflagration-yemen">Crisis Group has warned repeatedly</a></span> that absent a wide-ranging political process, including direct Huthi-Saudi talks aimed at de-escalating cross-border attacks and opening political space for intra-Yemeni discussions, Yemen will become more deeply enmeshed in the regional Cold War and become either a trigger for a regional hot war or the target of a U.S. attempt to strike at a symbol of Iranian expansionism. Military escalation on the part of the U.S. or its allies in Yemen would likely prove counterproductive, intensifying and lengthening the civil war to the detriment of Yemeni and Saudi Arabian civilians alike, and to any hope of a stable region.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/saudi-arabia/after-aramco-attack-middle-east-one-step-closer-its-1914-moment">https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/saudi-arabia/after-aramco-attack-middle-east-one-step-closer-its-1914-moment</a></span> = <span><a href="https://lobelog.com/after-the-aramco-attack-a-middle-east-one-step-closer-to-its-1914-moment/">https://lobelog.com/after-the-aramco-attack-a-middle-east-one-step-closer-to-its-1914-moment/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Yemeni children considered covering themselves in oil?

The Saudis have been blasting and bombing wretched Yemen, one of this world's poorest nations, since 2015.</p><p>These US-supported attacks and a naval blockade of Yemen imposed by Saudi Arabia and its sidekick ally, the United Arab Emirates, have caused mass starvation. No one knows how many Yemenis have died or are currently starving. Estimates run from 250,000 to one million.</p><p>The black humor? The Saudis just claimed they were victims of Iranian "aggression" this past week after the kingdom's leading oil treatment facility at Abqaiq was hit by a flight of armed drones or cruise missiles. The usual American militarists, now led by State Secretary Mike Pompeo after the demented warmonger, John Bolton, was finally fired, are calling for military retaliation against Iran even though the attack was claimed by Yemen's Shia Houthi movement.</p><p>I studied US photos of the damaged Saudi oil installations. Its oil tanks appear to be precisely hit at the same place. After the attack, the Saudis claimed half of their oil production was knocked out; but a day later, they vowed production would be resumed within a week. Parts of so-called drones were shown that appeared way beyond the technological capabilities of Yemen or even Iran. The missiles may have been supplied by Ukraine.</p><p>The Saudis, like their patron in Washington, have a poor record for truthfulness</p><p>The pattern of so-called drone attacks against the Saudi oil installations is just too neat and symmetrical. The Israelis have a strong interest in promoting a US-Saudi War.</p><p>As a long-time military observer, I find it very hard to believe that drones could be guided over such long distances and so accurately without aircraft or satellites to guide them. In Yemen, which is just creeping into the 12th century, changing a flat tire is a major technological achievement. To date, Iran's missile arsenal has poor reliability and major guidance problems.</p><p>Adding to the questions, the Saudis have spent billions on US-made air defense systems. They failed to protect the oil installations. </p><p>Bombing Iran's oil infrastructure would be relatively easy and has been intensively planned since early 2002. But what next? So-called "regime change" (Washington's favorite euphemism for overthrowing disobedient foreign governments) rarely works as planned and can get the US into horribly messy situations. The CIA overthrew Iran's democratic government in 1953 and look where we are today.</p><p>Perhaps the attacks on Abqaiq may cause the reckless Saudi leaders to stop devastating Yemen and throttle back on their proxy war against Iran which has gone on since 1979.

For Riyadh, this must become a critical question since their country also happens to be the largest purchaser of U.S. weapons in the Middle East. This humiliating attack should make Riyadh rethink its use of the U.S. Patriot missile defense system to ensure its security.</p><p><span>U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, attempted to downplay the ineffectiveness of the Patriot system against the Yemeni attack that dealt a huge blow to the Saudi economy and reputation of American defense systems.

It is for this reason that Russian Senate Security and Defense Committee member Franz Klintsevich, in a jovial way to lure new customers, stated that “if Saudi Arabia had installed the Russian anti-aircraft systems, this would not have happened. The S-300 and S-400 missile systems, supported by the Pantsir S-1 would not have allowed any of the drones and missiles to hit their target.

This influence was further legitimized at the political level on the negotiating table that gathered the Yemeni parties in the Saudi city of Jeddah and kicked off Sept. 10. </p><p>As things stand now, it seems that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will be given further political legitimacy that would perpetuate their military influence in the country.

But the government had a change of heart and finally <a href="http://www.sabanew.net/viewstory/53531">welcomed the dialogue</a>.</p><p>In turn, the STC welcomed the <a href="http://stcaden.com/news/10218">Saudi-UAE joint statement</a> calling for the talks and expressed its readiness to attend the Sept. 10 Jeddah conference without any preconditions.</p><p>These talks, however, remain ambiguous since the legitimate government has yet to announce the names of its representatives in the negotiations, and there has been no media statement about what is taking place in the political corridors. The STC, on the other hand, seems to be moving more at ease and with clear support from the UAE as it had explicitly declared the names of members of its delegation in the talks and gave comments to the media.</p><p>Sources in the Yemen presidential office, who preferred to remain anonymous for political and security reasons, told Al-Monitor, “There are no direct talks between the government and the STC,” stressing that “the current negotiations are taking place between the government and Saudi officials in order to reach a compromise for direct talks between the two.”</p><p>“So far, there is no breakthrough in the talks since the STC has imposed a high ceiling on its demands, while the government is also not offering many compromises,” the sources added, excepting the talks to falter.</p><p>The STC is seeking participation in the internationally recognized government by assuming positions in the local administrations located in the provinces under government control, such as Shabwa, Seiyun, Hadramut Valley and al-Ghaydah.</p><p>In light of the foregoing, the STC is raising the bar so high on its demands that the government cannot meet them as it does not wish to make further concessions, especially after losing the capital, Sanaa, in September 2014 and now the temporary capital of Aden.</p><p>Two scenarios are likely to play out after the talks. First, perhaps there will be an agreement to allow the STC to formally exercise authority in the areas under its control, and the government would control Shabwa, Sayun, al-Mahra and Wadi Hadramaut.</p><p>The second scenario, which is closer to the current political reality, would be to involve the STC in the government at the expense of the Islah Party with senior positions such as the vice president, and entrust it with major ministries such as the interior in addition to managing the local authority in the governorates under its control – by Ammar al-Ashwal</p><p><span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/09/south-yemen-houthis-government-legitimate-uae-saudi.html">https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/09/south-yemen-houthis-government-legitimate-uae-saudi.html</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span>Sudan and Yemen: why strengthening collaboration, fostering trust and sharing risk is key</span></p><p>Sana’a, Darfur and New York: you may wonder what connects these three places?

The security council resolution 2216 gave rights to Saudi-led coalition members to use all necessary means and measures, including military intervention, to restore a president with neither popularity nor support by any Yemeni parties on the ground. Until today, the results of this intervention include ongoing reports of horrific abuses, such as arbitrary killing, rape, and torture in Yemen, committed by some UN member states, mainly the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, with an impunity that underscores the collective failures of the international community.<br /> Human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent. Almost all states are guilty of politicizing human rights to a greater or lesser degree. Yet it is something rarely discussed, let alone addressed, and clearly present in the Yemeni catastrophe.<br /><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/randi.nord/videos/10104858510483098/">https://www.facebook.com/randi.nord/videos/10104858510483098/</a></span></p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p><span>UNO-Sondergesandter äußert Hoffnung auf Ende der Kampfhandlungen im Jemen</span></p><p><span>Der UNO-Sondergesandte für den Jemen, Griffiths, hat Hoffnungen auf die Einstellung der langjährigen Kampfhandlungen geäußert.</span></p><p><span>Sollte die jüngste Initiative der Huthi-Rebellen ernsthaft umgesetzt werden, könne von ihr ein starkes Signal zur Beendigung des Kriegs ausgehen, teilte Griffith mit.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/huthi-initiative-uno-sondergesander-aeussert-hoffnung-auf.1939.de.html">https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/huthi-initiative-uno-sondergesander-aeussert-hoffnung-auf.1939.de.html</a></span></p><p><span>Meine Bemerkung: S. auch cp2.</span></p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p>STATEMENT BY SPECIAL ENVOY FOR YEMEN ON THE ANSAR ALLAH ANNOUNCEMENT</p><p>The Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, welcomes the initiative announced by Ansar Allah on 20 September, on the cessation of hostile military acts against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The country is characterized by a complete absence of mechanisms that allow for public participation in the political process.</p><p>King Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz’s carefully crafted image as a reformer is at odds with reality. Since taking office in 2005 the king implemented greater restrictions on political freedoms, cracked down on reform advocates and concentrated power in the hands of the ruling family.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is a leading violator of human rights in the world. Citizens’ basic human rights are violated every day. Torture is common, and arbitrary arrests are widespread. The government bans the formation of independent human rights and civil society organizations. Religious freedom in Saudi Arabia does not exist. Non-Muslims are banned from practicing their faith or even possessing its symbols and artifacts. The government also imposes severe restrictions on its citizens, and especially on those who do not follow the Wahhabi strain of Islam.</p><p>The religious policies of the Saudi government have contributed to the rise of extremism and terror groups worldwide, including Al-Qaeda and others. Saudis are leading contributors of money and support to international terrorist groups and make up the highest numbers of suicide bombers around the world, which often occurs with either the direct support or the tacit approval of Saudi authorities.</p><p>The Saudi educational system provides an ideological foundation for violence and future jihadists. The textbooks currently used in Saudi schools, including those in the U.S. and Europe, preach hatred toward other Christians, Jews, other religions, and even most Muslims.</p><p>Saudi Arabia leads the world in discrimination against women and is the only country that practices gender apartheid. Women are treated as the property of their male guardians, and are legally considered unfit to make their own decisions. The Saudi government does not allow women to vote, study most sciences, work in public, drive, play sports, hold senior public positions, travel alone, mix with men, or attend public gatherings.</p><p>Freedom of the press is severely limited by the Saudi government through direct intervention and the resulting self-censorship of reporters and editors. Independent media is not allowed in the country and those who operate on the internet are blocked and prosecuted.</p><p><span><a href="http://www.gulfinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/The-Crisis-of-Religious-Freedom-in-Saudi-Arabia.pdf">http://www.gulfinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/The-Crisis-of-Religious-Freedom-in-Saudi-Arabia.pdf</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>Western countries raise concerns over Saudi rights record</span></p><p>Two dozen mainly European countries voiced concern on Monday at alleged torture, unlawful detentions and unfair trials of critics, including women activists and journalists, in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>It was the second joint statement criticizing the kingdom read out at the U.N.

It is, in particular, Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, and the de facto ruler of the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ).</span></p><p><span>The once Saudi-held role of a Muslim world leader has been irreparably damaged, thanks to the intrigues and efforts of MBZ, who not only embroiled the kingdom in spearheading the fight against the aspirations of the Arab peoples of the Middle East and North Africa for freedom and democracy, but has consistently whispered into the ear of the erratic MBS that he could indeed become king, if only he heeded his advice.</span></p><p><span>MBZ’s recommendations have always led to disaster for Saudi Arabia. The conflict in Yemen has transformed into a war of attrition for the kingdom and a historic opportunity for the UAE.</span></p><p><span>While the former continues to bleed heavily, the latter has embarked on a campaign of dividing Yemen once more into two, if not more, entities, while seizing control of the country’s most strategic ports along the Red Sea coast and offshore. </span></p><p><span>Going to war in Yemen is believed to have originally been an MBZ idea. The plan was to use the pro-Iranian Houthis, who were then confined to the Saada enclave in northern Yemen, which borders Saudi Arabia’s most southern province, as a tool to destroy the Muslim Brotherhood affiliate in Yemen, the Islah party, which seemed destined to win power through the ballot box if Yemeni democracy were allowed to succeed. </span></p><p><span>The plan backfired because, seeing the trap set for them, Islah decided not to engage the Houthis, who at the time were allied with the troops commanded by the late former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. The long-time Yemeni autocrat was in cahoots with the Emiratis and the Saudis right from the start.</span></p><p>Apart from MBZ, there are no winners in Yemen today – by Azzam Tamimi</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/will-mbs-bring-end-saudi-dynasty">https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/will-mbs-bring-end-saudi-dynasty</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>Saudi National day</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Riyadh?src=hashtag_click">#Riyadh</a></span><span> is going GREEN!

Dieser "Friedensplan für den Persischen Golf und die Straße von Hormus" sieht seinen Worten nach vor, dass ein Bündnis der Anrainerstaaten für den Schutz der Handelsschiffahrt in den betreffenden Gebieten sorgt. Dieser Schutz ist auch das Anliegen der US-amerikanischen Operation Sentinel, die vom Vereinigten Königreich und Australien unterstützt und vom Iran abgelehnt wird (vgl. <span><a href="https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Strasse-von-Hormuz-Die-US-Operation-Sentinel-laeuft-4509513.html">Straße von Hormus: Die US-Operation "Sentinel" läuft</a></span>).</p><p>Eine "Einmischung von außen", so Rouhani gestern, sei "für den Persischen Golf problematisch und gefährlich" - und "ausländische Truppen" könnten "Probleme und Unsicherheit für unser Volk und unsere Region verursachen".

Saudiarabien will Dominanz über Jemen erlangen, über den Nachbarn, der schon immer als problematisch empfunden wurde. Problematisch, weil die Jemeniten sich nie der in Saudiarabien tonangebenden Wahhabiten-Ideologie unterjochen wollten. Anderseits benötigte die Wirtschaft Saudiarabiens ständig die Jemeniten als Arbeitskräfte.</p><p>Zwischen Saudiarabien und Iran eskalierten die Spannungen seit 1979, also seit dem Sieg des «politischen Islams» in Iran. Weshalb? Iran profilierte sich als Erfolgsmodell für etwas Neues, für ein vom Volk getragenes System. Dass diese «Volksverbundenheit» nur teilweise den Realitäten entsprach, erschien nebensächlich – selbst in den Jahren der Khomeini-Diktatur hatte das «Volk» in Iran eine gewisse Mitsprache.</p><p>Wichtiger war von Anfang an die wirtschaftliche Konkurrenz. Saudiarabien «verkauft» sich gerne als das Land mit den grössten Erdölressourcen der Welt</p><p>Qatar nahm bei der Vermarktung des flüssigen Gases die führende Stellung ein, Iran sprang, im Rahmen seiner (durch Sanktionen eingeschränkten) Möglichkeiten auf den Zug auf. Was letztendlich bedeutet: Wer Erdgas hat, ist auf dem aufsteigenden Ast, wer das nicht hat und mehrheitlich auf Erdöl angewiesen ist, auf dem absteigenden.</p><p>Saudiarabiens Reichtum ist nur noch Legende</p><p>Saudiarabien ist also, verglichen mit Iran, auf der Verliererseite. Und man kann davon ausgehen, dass auch der forsche Kronprinz Mohammed bin Salman das weiss. Er muss eigentlich auch wissen, dass Saudiarabien längst nicht so reich ist, wie es sich selbst nach aussen darstellt. Vielleicht ist Saudiarabien sogar ein Staat kurz vor einer Krise? Dafür spricht Einiges.</p><p>Vor fünf Jahren betrugen Saudiarabiens Devisenreserven 674 Milliarden Dollar. Im gleichen Jahr erlitt das Königreich ein Defizit von zwischen 90 und 100 Milliarden. Im Folgejahr waren es nochmals 70 Milliarden, danach weitere 50 Milliarden. Dann wurde die Rechnung wieder einigermassen ausgeglichen, weil der Ölpreis anstieg.

His father still lives in Yemen and is an important source of information, as well as a connection to his home country.</p><p>"My father lives in Aden," says Mohammed. "He cannot leave. He doesn't want to; it is his home country. Through him I hear about the frustration. To me, it's frustrating that our political leaders are not willing or committed to achieving peace, or creating prosperity."</p><p>But Mohammed is still optimistic that peace can be restored. Given the chaotic situation on the ground, with the constant power plays and an increasingly fragmented society, he's well aware how naive that must sound.</p><p>The social fabric is becoming looser and looser and people are fighting [based on] identity," he explains.
