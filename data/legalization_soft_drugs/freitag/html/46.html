The first step is to pass on “best practice” in favor of a critical, reflexive approach</p><p>Considering the realities of post-war reconstruction, instead of calling out failure, it may be more useful to focus on what was achieved given a catastrophic situation, limited capacities, and meager resources. After all, PWR is supposed to come to a place struck by the tragic destruction of livelihoods, market networks, health, sanitation, and education infrastructures, and turn all of those around. It must do so through processes implemented in an environment of insecurity, instability, fragile negotiated settlements, post-conflict competition between actors, rearrangement of power structures, existing war economies, new reconstruction economies, weak central governments, multiple donor priorities, and local perceptions of favoritism. </p><p>The Tragedy of Yemen<br /> It is widely acknowledged that the conflict in Yemen has led to one of the greatest preventable disasters facing humanity. The extent of the tragedy is difficult to measure due to the scarcity of reliable data, but the estimates are staggering. </p><p>Some Dos and Don’ts<br /> Yemen’s post-war reconstruction will not meet donor/recipient expectations and will face colossal challenges to avoid total failure. Based on the above and on the specific nature of Yemen’s politics, a number of steps can be taken to maximize the positive effects and minimize the inevitable negative outcomes.</p><p>Decentralize Reconstruction</p><p>Put Communities First</p><p>A second step is to put communities first, and the interests of international NGOs (INGOs) second. As much as we prefer to think otherwise, there exists a relief and reconstruction complex of some local, but mainly international, NGOs who do good, but also make massive amounts of money by acting as intermediaries for much of the funding coming into a country from donors.</p><p>Beware Donor Conditionality</p><p>Support Start-Ups and SMEs</p><p>Post-war reconstruction presents a country with an opportunity to create a new merchant class and diversify the accumulation of wealth. </p><p>Invest in Wartime Innovation</p><p>War pushed Yemenis toward innovation and entrepreneurial initiatives. One important example is in the energy sector. The destruction of the power system forced people to find alternative sources of energy</p><p>Heal the Environment, Prioritize Health</p><p>The environmental footprint of modern warfare is staggering. A bomb is not simply a bomb. Each one of the millions upon millions of bombs used in this war leaves a chemical residue </p><p>Weaken, Don’t Strengthen, Sectarianism and Regionalism</p><p>Finally, it is vital to continuously reflect on how we think when we approach reconstruction. Reconstruction is not an exact science. It is essentially an art whose key tool is a deep, localized understanding of the social fabric, political structure, cultural context, and economy of a country. Being an art, at its heart lie not theories and models (especially economic ones), but rather passion and imagination—a passion for human prosperity and wellbeing, and an imagination for how to achieve this in different localities. The hope now is that artists with imagination and passion as well as reflection and understanding will lead or significantly contribute to the process of Yemen’s reconstruction – by Abdullah Hamidaddin</p><p><span><a href="https://www.thecairoreview.com/essays/how-yemen-rises/">https://www.thecairoreview.com/essays/how-yemen-rises/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Inside east Yemen: the Gulf's new proxy war no one is talking about</strong></p><p>A battle for control of Mahra, Yemen's most eastern and quiet province, has ignited dangerous tensions within the Gulf </p><p>Men and women have staged regular protests against what they deem to be an “occupation” of their lands by <span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SaudiArabia">Riyadh</a></span>, that is spearheading a military coalition fighting the <span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/iran">Iran</a></span>-backed <span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Houthi">Houthi</a></span> rebels on the other side of the country.</p><p>Isolated by yawning ravines and sweeping moonscapes, Mahra, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Yemen">Yemen’s</a>most eastern province, had been spared the horrors of the five-year war that was triggered by the Houthis ousting the recognised Yemeni government.</p><p>It has also, until recently, seen little presence of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda and the<span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/isis"> Islamic State</a></span>.</p><p>The Mahri tribes, who speak their own unique language, have retained a strong sense of independence and, other than hosting displaced families, largely steered clear of the Yemen war that erupted in 2015.</p><p>But since late 2017, the often-forgotten region found itself embroiled in Yemen’s newest proxy war between Gulf countries.

The Saudis unfurled a further five main bases, some still under construction, and according to locals as many as 20 smaller outposts sparking alarm and outrage among the Mahri who accuse the Saudis of a land grab.</p><p>The Saudi authorities have repeatedly defended their actions saying heavy weaponry was being funnelled through the sea route or the notoriously corrupt border with <span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Oman">Oman</a></span> to the Houthi rebels who were firing missiles at Saudi Arabia that were reaching far as Riyadh.</p><p>Saudi’s presence has not just agitated the locals but, according to experts and foreign diplomats, caused a growing rift with neighbouring Oman, another regional powerhouse.</p><p>The resulting tensions have received little international attention, but could have wide-reaching and potentially devastating consequences for the region if both sides continue to fight for control of the area.</p><p>“Mahra was isolated and the last stable place in Yemen.

In a personal account from Sanaa, a Yemeni journalist shares his account of how life has changed for ordinary Yemenis under Houthi rule after half a decade of fighting.</p><p>War does not bring good things even when they say it will. This war has destroyed us while it was said, "it will help us." They told us about the plan to "build a modern Yemen," but this has been replaced by war and destruction carried out by various extremist religious militias.</p><p>There has been an end to political rights and freedom of expression, something Yemenis dreamed of before the troubles with the Houthis started in 2014. All the while there have been discussions around a peace settlement and legislative elections, the violence has increased and the number of poor and starving people is increasing day by day.</p><p>Extremist armed groups are practicing what appears to be ethnic and political cleansing in the areas they control. First it was their political opponents, now they are targeting their allies too.</p><p>In a way, the various parties in the war have all become similar. </p><p>Every armed party describes its activities as a "duty to maintain security against traitors and enemy agents," usually those who belong to another party. Yet not one of these "governments" cares to pay salaries, provide services or protect the rights of ordinary Yemenis. Instead, their roles are dedicated to imposing power by force, collecting money from people, squashing their opponents' rights, and occupying their property.</p><p>A choice between bad and bad</p><p>The reality in the capital, Sanaa, today is that you no longer have the right to demand payment of salaries for teachers and employees, or to demand health services. The world supported a militia while it eliminated everything related to law in my country, and turned the rest of the political forces into militias. Our choice is between bad and bad.

The al Houthi movement, which benefits from the infighting, has continued to take on the vestiges of a state and drawn closer to Iran.

Iran has expanded its influence in the Arabian Peninsula over the course of the Yemeni civil war. The Iranian-backed al Houthi movement threatens Red Sea security and asymmetrically threatens US Gulf state partners.

One of the most impoverished Arab nations faces the threat of falling apart as a result of conflicting interests and agendas by two of the most financially and militarily capable Arab countries in the Gulf. 10 raids launched by UAE jets on pro-Saudi forces in southern Yemen yesterday, killing and injuring hundreds according to STC (Southern Transitional Council) sources, have raised tension between the two sides to new and unprecedented levels.</p><p>Widening rift as interests diverge</p><p>Much has changed in terms of implementing own agendas and chasing individual interests and goals in the Yemen war. It looks like the UAE strongest man, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Zayed (MBZ) is sensing a historical chance to enforce his own agenda in Yemen, at the expense of his Saudi allies. Government forces managed to drive out STC militias from several districts in Aden, including the presidential palace and the airport, before the separatist militia was able to regain control of the city the following day, thanks to the deadly UAE air raids.</p><p>Four years into the military intervention in 2015, theoretically in support of Yemen’s internationally recognized government after the Houthi rebel movement seized the capital, Sanaa, and much of northern Yemen, MBZ seems adamant not to stay in the position of the Coalition’s underdog any more. This development is said to have enraged his Saudi counterpart Muhammad Bin Salman (MBS), already in much domestic and international trouble.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.insideover.com/war/uae-fractures-saudi-led-yemen-coalition.html">https://www.insideover.com/war/uae-fractures-saudi-led-yemen-coalition.html</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Yemen fighting brings Saudi-led coalition to brink of collapse</p><p>Michael Knights at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who spent months embedded with UAE forces in Yemen, told CNN that the Emiratis "are not willing to accept al Qaeda-type elements mobilizing and offering their services to the government."</p><p>The Emiratis have armed and trained another group in Aden -- the Southern Transitional Council (STC) -- which controls much of the city and ultimately wants independence for south Yemen. They distrust one of the Saudis' key allies in Yemen, the Islah party, which is an Islamist movement.</p><p>In turn, the Yemeni government is now accusing the STC and the Houthis of working together to "force the government and national army into side-battles that benefit Iran and its tools in Yemen."</p><p>The fighting and the bitter war of words leave Saudi Arabia -- as the senior partner in the coalition -- with yet another headache. </p><p>Efforts by the UAE and the Saudis to bring the government and the southern separatists to Riyadh for talks have so far come to nothing. Knights says one consequence is that the frontlines against the Houthis -- around the port of Hodeidah for example -- have been stripped of the best units, as both the government and the STC look to protect their positions in the southern provinces. A State Department official told CNN in a statement: "We support a negotiated resolution between the Republic of Yemen government and the Southern Transitional Council, and efforts to mediate the dispute.</p><p>"Further divisions within Yemen will only increase the suffering of the Yemeni people and prolong the conflict," the official added.</p><p>Knights does not expect peace to break out any time soon.

However, southern Yemen’s complicated history led to the development and strengthening of AQAP, and has turned the country’s southern population into the primary victims of suppression and terror, both from AQAP and its predecessors.</p><p>AQAP—arguably the most powerful branch of al-Qaeda—uses a large portion of southern Yemeni territory seized following the Yemeni <span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-al-qaeda-crescent-in-yemen">revolution</a></span> in 2011 as its base. A few years later, it further secured its position during the instability in the south caused by Yemen’s most recent conflict between Houthis and the Hadi government. However, the development of the AQAP stretches back much further than the current conflict, with its roots developing decades earlier.</p><p>The latest civil war provided a greater vacuum for AQAP to flourish in the south, allowing al-Qaeda to expand from the remote areas it controlled in the south to major cities, such as Hadramout province’s capital <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/04/world/middleeast/al-qaeda-al-mukalla-yemen.html">Mukalla</a></span>. AQAP’s rule there and elsewhere ushered in obscene levels of violence throughout the peninsula. During the takeover of Mukalla, AQAP targeted journalists and activists, conducted house raids, and kidnapped and killed anyone who they saw as a threat to their presence. </p><p>As the southern region’s challenging history demonstrates, southern Yemenis are the population that suffers most from the presence of AQAP, and while Yemen’s civil war is complicated, efforts to fight against terror should be clear-cut and internationally supported. Now that southerners are fighting back, the international community should not miss this chance to support Yemenis in their efforts remove the presence of these terrorists from their midst – by Summer Ahmed</p><p><span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/aqap-in-south-yemen-past-and-present">https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/aqap-in-south-yemen-past-and-present</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp15 Propaganda</span></h2><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Is US-backed dialogue the answer for Yemen?</p><p>Dialogue sometimes has adverse effects on conflicts. It can buy ill-intentioned parties time to expand their influence, ultimately working to the detriment of those seeking peace.</p><p>However, the United States’ willingness to have its ally engage in “secret talks” with the Houthis, whom it considers Iranian proxies, is raising serious questions about the efficacy of its foreign policy. Not only does it underline US President Donald Trump’s at times volatile policy moves, it brings to the fore Washington’s growing frustration with — and incoherent response to — a conflict that has turned into a dangerous front line in the showdown with Tehran.</p><p>At the heart of the problem is the Houthis’ agenda. The Iran-backed rebels have given no indication they are interested in peace, deploying rockets and drones at Saudi Arabia. Now Washington is asking Riyadh to forget about these flagrant attacks and join their nemesis at the negotiating table.
