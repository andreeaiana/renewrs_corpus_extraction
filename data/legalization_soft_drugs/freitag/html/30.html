The Saudis tried to settle Wahhabis in Zaidi territory?</em></p><p>That's right. ... It's been a Saudi solution to their internal extremist problem. People who are even more extreme than the ruling, the dominant group in Saudi Arabia, to export it. So we saw that most vividly in the 1980s, when people like Osama bin Laden and his followers moved to Afghanistan and were financed, encouraged to do so by the regime in Saudi Arabia. We've seen it more recently in Syria, where they've done the same thing. And in 1979 in Yemen, as you just said, they sent someone who just tried to overthrow the Saudi regime, amazingly. ... But they let him out and said, "OK, off you go to northern Yemen," and he set up a madrassa, sort of an academy, which over the years became a hotbed of extreme Wahhabism, which the local Zaidis didn't care for at all. And in reaction, they turned to Iran and asked for, really, not weapons or anything, but initially at least for instructors and literature. They thought they should get serious about their religion, and they sort of drifted more towards the sort of mainstream Iranian Shia variant.</p><p><em>So this guy Hussein al-Houthi was the leader of the Shias in Yemen who turned to Iran for religious inspiration?</em></p><p>That's right.</p><p><em>Were the Houthis engaging in terrorism?</em></p><p>There's no sign of that at all. As I said, their main occupation was smuggling and selling khat and weapons. I mean, but on a strictly commercial basis.</p><p><em>So here's where we get Saudi Arabia more directly involved. Yemen's then-president, Saleh, got the Saudis involved by sending his own forces across the border to hit the Houthis from the rear. The Houthis respond by sending a small invasion force into Saudi Arabia, and then we have a conflict.</em></p><p>That's right. The Houthis sent, it was a few, 300 men, I think from memory, went into Saudi Arabia. Then the Saudis sort of freaked out and declared a general mobile military mobilization and began bombing northern Yemen, bombing the Houthi territory. But actually, they lost. The Houthis defeated the Saudi ground forces that were sent against them. And the Saudi air force, it was bombing away and did hit some of the main Houthi city, Sa'dah. But otherwise it was militarily ineffectual. It was kind of a fiasco of a campaign on the Saudis' part.</p><p><em>What ties us to the Saudis economically?</em></p><p>A huge amount of money. Well, all sorts of things still. The one that really hits the eye is the enormous trade in weapons from us to them – Kris Boyd interviewing Andrew Cockburn</p><p><a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2016/09/28/qa-us-blessed-saudi-war-small-group-impoverished-smugglers-yemen">http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2016/09/28/qa-us-blessed-saudi-war-small-group-impoverished-smugglers-yemen</a></p><p>Comment: Very interesting article, information on the deeper background of the main conflict.</p><p><strong>28.9.2016 – AFP (** B H K)</strong></p><p><strong>Children starving in rebel-held Yemen fishing village</strong></p><p>With their eyes bulging, stomachs swollen and bones visible, children in the rebel-held fishing village of Al-Khukha are facing starvation as Yemen's conflict shows no signs of ending.</p><p>Even before the outbreak of violence in 2011, malnutrition was a chronic problem in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country.</p><p>The situation is so bad in Al-Khukha, near Hodeida on the Red Sea coast, that some doctors estimate as many as half of the village's children are at risk of dying.</p><p>"We have nothing to eat," Hayat Ahmed says over the cries of her famished son lying nearby on a makeshift rope bed.</p><p>She says men from the village used to go fishing in the waters between Yemen's Red Sea coast and the Horn of Africa.</p><p>"But they no longer go into the sea because of the war and air strikes," Ahmed adds.

Physical damage was endured in 274 health facilities (69 health facilities are totally damaged and 205 are partially damaged). The preliminary results of the 2016 HeRAMS show that only 45% of surveyed health facilities were fully functional and 17% have stopped functioning.</p><p>The HeRAMS results reveal a dramatic gap in health services’ availability. General services and trauma management services are available only in one third of the health facilities. Child health and nutrition services are available in approximately 4 out of 10 facilities. It was found that communicable diseases management was the most available category of health services (available in 55% of the surveyed facilities), while maternal and newborn health interventions were offered in 35% of the surveyed health facilities. Notably, noncommunicable and mental health services were the least available (in 18% of the health facilities).</p><p>HeRAMS also confirmed existing critical shortages in the health workforce. More than 33 000 health staff are working in 16 governorates with wide variations in the distribution among the governorates. 70% of 16 surveyed governorates report the level of staffing below the WHO benchmark of 22 health workers for every 10 000 population.</p><p><a href="http://www.emro.who.int/yem/yemen-news/health-services-decline-as-conflict-in-yemen-continues.html">http://www.emro.who.int/yem/yemen-news/health-services-decline-as-conflict-in-yemen-continues.html</a></p><p><strong>27.9.2016 – Save the Children (** B H)</strong></p><p><strong>YEMEN HOSPITALS RUN OUT OF MEDICINE FOR DANGEROUSLY MALNOURISHED CHILDREN</strong></p><p>Children going untreated in Yemen hospitals unless parents supply own medicine</p><p>Desperate parents are being asked to provide their own medicines to treat their malnourished babies and children, as Yemen’s hospitals run out of supplies and the health system has collapsed.</p><p>But Yemeni families told Save the Children staff they are so poor they can barely afford fuel and transport costs to get to hospitals. Even when families are able to borrow cash to get to hospital, they cannot then afford essential medicines once they get there.</p><p>Dr Abdullah Thabit who runs the Malnutrition Section of Al Sabeen mother and child hospital in the capital Sana’a said: “On Saturday two twins died because of a lack of medicine. The situation here is very critical, we receive more than three cases of malnourished children every day from different governorates.</p><p>“There are not enough rooms, no medicine and a lack of doctors. The hospital cannot provide salaries to bring more doctors. The salary is not enough because the cost of currency is going up and food is expensive.</p><p>“Meanwhile, we ask the patients to buy medicine themselves from outside the hospital. Some cannot afford the medicines so they leave and they don’t come back and we don’t know what will happen next, especially to their children.”</p><p>The hospital’s manager Dr Hilal AlBahri said: “Children are dying and we are out of medicine. The health system has already collapsed.”</p><p>Other parents have sold their possessions and taken out loans. Yemeni families told Save the Children staff they have lost their jobs and livelihoods as a result of the war so cannot afford food and medicine. Many are eating just one meal a day.</p><p>Save the Children therefore welcomes the UK government’s support at the UN Human Rights Council .</p><p><a href="http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/2016-09/yemen-hospitals-run-out-medicine-dangerously-malnourished-children">http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/2016-09/yemen-hospitals-run-out-medicine-dangerously-malnourished-children</a></p><p>Comment: The last sentence cited here is superfluous.

Die von Saudi Arabien geführte Koalition hat bestätigt, die beiden Angriffe verübt zu haben. Bei einem der beiden Angriffe wurde am 15. August 2016 das von <em>Ärzte ohne Grenzen</em> unterstützte Krankenhaus in Abs in der jemenitischen Provinz Hadscha getroffen. Der andere Angriff traf am 2. Dezember 2015 das Krankenhaus von <em>Ärzte ohne Grenzen</em> in Taiz. Die nun veröffentlichten Berichte beschreiben detailliert, was vor, während und nach den Luftangriffen passiert ist. <em>Ärzte ohne Grenzen</em> ist mit der militärischen Führung der von Saudi Arabien geführten Koalition in Kontakt und hat mehrfach die ernsten Folgen dieser Angriffe thematisiert.</p><p>Diese Angriffe führen nicht nur zu einem Verlust von Menschenleben und zu Zerstörung, sondern auch zu einer Unterbrechung der medizinischen Aktivitäten. Menschen, die ohnehin sehr verletzlich sind, haben so keinen Zugang mehr zu medizinischer Versorgung. Infolge der Bombardierung des Krankenhauses in Abs hat sich <em>Ärzte ohne Grenzen</em> <a href="https://www.aerzte-ohne-grenzen.at/presse/aerzte-ohne-grenzen-zieht-mitarbeiter-wegen-luftangriffen-aus-sechs-kliniken-im-jemen">aus sechs Krankenhäusern im nördlichen Jemen zurückgezogen</a>.</p><p>Auch wenn sich beide Bombenangriffe in vieler Hinsicht deutlich voneinander unterscheiden, trafen sie in beiden Fällen voll funktionierende Gesundheitseinrichtungen. In beiden Fällen wurde der geschützte Status medizinischer Hilfe nicht respektiert. Die internen Untersuchungen der Angriffe in Abs und Taiz kommen auch zu dem Schluss, dass die Neutralität und Unparteilichkeit der Einrichtungen vor den Angriffen gegeben waren. Es gibt deshalb keine legitimen Gründe für die Angriffe. Die Details der Berichte weisen eindeutig darauf hin, wie der Krieg im Jemen von allen Konfliktparteien geführt wird: Ohne jeglichen Respekt für ziviles Leben.</p><p><a href="https://www.aerzte-ohne-grenzen.at/article/sitzung-des-un-sicherheitsrates-zum-schutz-medizinischer-hilfe-aerzte-ohne-grenzen">https://www.aerzte-ohne-grenzen.at/article/sitzung-des-un-sicherheitsrates-zum-schutz-medizinischer-hilfe-aerzte-ohne-grenzen</a> = <a href="https://www.aerzte-ohne-grenzen.de/yemen-bericht-aerzte-ohne-grenzen-angriffe-krankenhaeuser">https://www.aerzte-ohne-grenzen.de/yemen-bericht-aerzte-ohne-grenzen-angriffe-krankenhaeuser</a></p><p><strong>27.9.2016 – Médecins Sans Frontières (** A K)</strong></p><p><strong>Member states must advance concrete measures to protect access to medical care in conflict zones</strong></p><p>After conducting internal investigations, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is releasing two reports describing attacks on medical facilities it runs or supports in Yemen. The two attacks combined resulted in the death of 20 people, most of them patients, and wounded 32 others. Both attacks were acknowledged by the Saudi-led coalition (SLC). The attacks were on a<a href="http://reliefweb.int/node/1711001">hospital in Abs, Hajjah governorate on 15 August 2016</a>, and on the <a href="http://reliefweb.int/node/1710991">MSF clinic in Taiz city on 2 December 2015</a>. The reports detail the actions taken before, during and immediately after the airstrikes. MSF is engaged with the military leadership of the SLC and have raised our serious concerns about the attacks.</p><p>Beyond the immediate loss of life and destruction caused by the bombings, the attacks led to a suspension of activities that left an already very vulnerable population without access to healthcare. As a consequence of the bombing of Abs hospital, <a href="http://www.msf.org/en/article/yemen-indiscriminate-bombings-and-unreliable-reassurances-saudi-led-coalition-force-msf">MSF withdrew from six hospitals in northern Yemen</a>.</p><p>While there are significant differences in the circumstances surrounding each incident, in both cases, the bombings hit fully functioning health facilities and the protected nature of the medical mission was not respected. <a href="http://reliefweb.int/node/1711001">The internal investigations of the Abs</a> and <a href="http://reliefweb.int/node/1710991">Taiz</a> incidents also conclude that the neutrality and impartiality of the facilities had not been compromised before the attacks and therefore there was no legitimate reason to attack them. The details of the incidents documented in these two reports are unambiguous indicators of how war is being waged in Yemen, where there is an utter disregard for civilian life by all warring parties.</p><p>UN Security Council (UNSC) <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2016/722">resolution 2286</a>, passed last May, condemned attacks on medical facilities in conflict situations and demanded that all parties to armed conflict comply fully with their obligations under international law.

A more detailed report will be released shortly. The objective of the investigation is to ascertain the facts surrounding the attack on the hospital and to establish whether the safety and security of staff and operations can be assured on the ground in Yemen. The investigation was carried out by an MSF humanitarian affairs adviser based at the organisation’s headquarters (HQ) in Barcelona, with critical support from past and present MSF staff involved in the Yemen operations at HQ and field level.<br /> For the purpose of this internal review, 35 interviews were conducted with key MSF staff from the Yemen mission and the Abs hospital project, including direct eyewitnesses of the attack, and with patients who were at the hospital at the time of the airstrike. Additionally, relevant internal and external documentation, Yemen context analyses and photographic material were reviewed.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>On Monday 15 August at 3.40pm local time, the Abs rural hospital in Hajjah governorate in northwestern Yemen was hit by an airstrike killing 19 people, including one MSF staff member, and injuring 24 others.

The other four attacks on MSF-supported medical services were: Haydan hospital, in the Sa’ada governorate, on 26 October 2015; a mobile clinic in the al-Houban district in Taizz on 2 December 2015; Shiara hospital in Razeh, also in Sa’ada, on 10 January 2016; and an ambulance belonging to the Al Jamhoory hospital in Sa’ada town on 22 January 2016.</p><p>On 15 August 2016, at 3.40pm local time, a plane launched a projectile at Abs hospital without previous warning or communication with the MSF mission.

The airstrike injured 9 people including a MSF health educator and the MSF guard. One of the wounded persons died of his injuries the following day. · The clinic was set up in a white tent, 5 m x 6 m, marked with a flag with the MSF logo. The airstrike hit the ground at 22 metres distance from the clinic. · At the moment of the airstrike, the clinic was closed. Normal clinic times are from 09:00 to 14:00. But on this day, the health staff and the patients left the location at around 13:40.</p><p>The team left early as there were only a small amount of patients due to other airstrikes in other parts of the neighbourhood earlier in the morning.· Of the people who were injured, 3 were next to the tent and the rest were at a short distance. Those present next to the clinic-tent included the person who died the following day and the MSF guard, who was seriously injured. Two of nine injured were transferred to Al Qaidah hospital; seven to Al Rasalah hospital. · The explosion was very heavy and felt by all the staff in the nearby MSF Mother and Child hospital. Staff started panicking and were scared, some started crying and wanted to go home. After phone discussion with the Hospital-Manager, it was decided to stop non-essential activities in the hospital and let the staff go home.</p><p>Following the airstrike a big part of the displaced population fled the area. In addition, the host community started to demand the displaced people leave the area, saying that it was because of them that MSF setup a clinic and that this led to the airstrike happening in the area. Most people are now displaced to Jabal Raimy and Al-Qahaaf.</p><p><a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/msf-incident-report-airstrike-taiz-health-clinic-houban-district-taiz-city-2-december">http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/msf-incident-report-airstrike-taiz-health-clinic-houban-district-taiz-city-2-december</a> and in full: <a href="http://www.msf.org/sites/msf.org/files/taiz_airstrike_clinic.pdf">http://www.msf.org/sites/msf.org/files/taiz_airstrike_clinic.pdf</a> = <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Yemen_Taiz_investigation_summary_final.pdf">http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Yemen_Taiz_investigation_summary_final.pdf</a></p><p>And summed up in various articles:</p><p><strong>27.9.2016 – Middle East Eye (** A K)</strong></p><p><strong>Saudi raids on Yemen hospitals violated international law: MSF</strong></p><p>The French NGO described the attacks on its health facilities as 'unjustified and unprovoked' despite providing coordinates and signs</p><p>A damning report from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has accused the Saudi-led coalition of violating international humanitarian law by repeatedly bombing its medical facilities in Yemen, forcing it to quit the country.</p><p>The strike, which killed 19 people and wounded 24 others and drew international condemnation, followed air raids on nearby areas, MSF said.

When it is spoken about, it is described in circles as among the most forgotten on the globe. But this is a misnomer. Yemen is not forgotten, it has been wilfully ignored. And given that some of the main players in the UN Security Council are trying their best to deflect from the issue, the lack of global regard for the matter is unsurprising.</p><p>From the onset, Saudi Arabia has been on a campaign to divert any attention from its crimes in the country at the UN Security Council - despite not having a seat there. Foreign Policy magazine described Saudi Arabia as having “succeeded in blocking actions to restrain its military conduct and highlight the humanitarian costs of the conflict”.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US and UK - the primary benefactors in the war in Yemen - consider the alliance with Saudi Arabia as so important that they are willing to sacrifice their self-respect to keep that alliance alive.</p><p>The story of a sectarian divide between Shia and Sunnis - a primary narrative in this war - frankly underwhelms in the face of another murky, unsubstantiated war for power and control.</p><p>Many observers say the US is only supporting Saudi Arabia as a way to balance their relations between Riyadh and Tehran in the region. The war does not live up to any international standards of scrutiny, nor is there is any endgame in sight.</p><p>The US however is still the gatekeeper of the conflict. The Saudis do not have the technical know-how to run a campaign of this nature on their own and need US expertise to continue its campaign. But little is likely to change.</p><p>Meanwhile, the rest of the world is waiting for an Aylan Kurdi moment before it is roused from its indifference.</p><p>The lack of mobilisation over the travesty in Yemen is hypocritical.</p><p>But on deeper inspection, it is clear that Saudi Arabia here, again, is a mere a servant of the empire.</p><p>The winners-losers of this conflict remain the same – by Azad Essa</p><p><a href="http://www.iol.co.za/pretoria-news/opinion/azad-essa-wheres-the-outrage-over-slaughter-in-yemen-2073429">http://www.iol.co.za/pretoria-news/opinion/azad-essa-wheres-the-outrage-over-slaughter-in-yemen-2073429</a></p><p>Comment: One point is wrong: This is NO Saudi-Iran proxy war.</p><p>27.9.2016 – Shafaqna (B P)</p><p>EDITORIAL: Justice for Yemen should not turn in a game of politicking</p><p>I am referring here to Taiz and the siege this one city has found itself under for several months.</p><p>War has come to Yemen.

Yemeni people and children can’t [feel] freedom anymore at all,” Yara says.</p><p>In the video she posted on YouTube less than a month ago, Yara says she remembers the day it all began as if it were only yesterday. She also tells viewers of her constant fears that her family will be killed, of her problems sleeping because of the constant bombing, and of her contempt for the Saudi-led coalition.<br /> “The Saudis are lying, they are lying to all the countries that are giving them money to fight against us and destroy our country.<br /> “They are telling them, ‘We are just helping [Yemenis],’ but they are not helping us, they are destroying us… destroying our schools, our factories, making children die – my family, all families, are maybe going to die,” she says.</p><p>Ten-year-old Yara is pleading for the US to stop selling weapons to the region.<br /> “I want America to stop the war.

Thus, it is understandable that the negotiations may have threats and opportunities for Ansarullah. By reviewing the pros and cons of Ansarullah entering the negotiations, the importance and significance of each threat or opportunity can be understood.</p><p>The supporters of Ansarullah’s presence in the political negotiations, argue that due to the weakened infrastructure of Yemen, and the loss of a part of Ansarullah during the Saudi war, it is reasonable for this movement to attend the negotiations in order to prevent more losses and also follow its goals at the negotiation table.</p><p>Another group of the supporters that have more realistic views believe that Ansarullah’s participation in the political bargaining process could be considered a practice to strengthen the political power of the movement.</p><p>Participating in the negotiations and forming a coalition government could be an achievement for this group as a general movement in Yemen. That being said, Ansarullah will not be able to take complete control of the government, but it could be part of the official governing power.</p><p>Although the opponents and critics of Ansarullah’s participation in the political negotiations do not disagree with the totality of the negotiations, they also do not consider the subjects present at the negotiation table in favour of Ansarullah, nor do they consider it the right time for this movement’s involvement in the negotiations.</p><p>The opposition group also believes that in the current anarchic situation, considering that Ansarullah itself is a power pole among multiple dimensions of power, the results of negotiations will not be sustainable. Hence, this opposition group argues that Ansarullah should insist on not delivering the weaponry and not giving back the seized cities.</p><p><a href="http://alwaght.com/en/News/68971/Should-Yemen%E2%80%99s-Ansarullah-Negotiate-with-Saudi-Arabia">http://alwaght.com/en/News/68971/Should-Yemen%E2%80%99s-Ansarullah-Negotiate-with-Saudi-Arabia</a>?</p><p>29.9.2016 – Eghtesad Online (A P)</p><p>Envoy rejects Saudi Arabia’s letter to UN as false</p><p>“Iran has not had policies on dispatching arms for Ansarullah fighters,” Khoshrou said in his letter to the UN Security Council on Wednesday.<br /> The Iranian envoy said that the Saudi Arabia’s letter included unsubstantiated claims that have not been verified by any independent entity. <br /> “These claims are raised against the numerous confirmed reports, documenting Saudi Arabia’s war crimes and violation of international law and international humanitarian law.”<br /> According to IRNA, the following is Ambassador Khoshrou's letter to the UN Security Council President:</p><p><a href="http://www.en.eghtesadonline.com/Section-news-2/3990-envoy-rejects-saudi-arabia-letter-to-un-as-false">http://www.en.eghtesadonline.com/Section-news-2/3990-envoy-rejects-saudi-arabia-letter-to-un-as-false</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp7a Iran und Golfstaaten / Iran and Gulf States</strong></span></h2><p>28.9.2016 – Press TV Iran (A P)</p><p>Iran Rejects ‘Baseless’ Allegations by Bahrain, UAE</p><p>Iran has dismissed as “baseless and absurd” the Emirati foreign minister’s allegations that Tehran is fueling regional insecurity, saying such remarks come despite Abu Dhabi’s deadly bombing campaign against Yemeni civilians.</p><p>Abbas Yazdani, the first secretary of the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations made the comments in an address to the world body’s General Assembly.</p><p>“It is absurd and hypocritical for the official of a country whose jet fighters are bombing innocent civilians in Yemen to accuse Iran of interfering in domestic affairs of other countries,” said Yazdani.</p><p>On September 24, Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan claimed during the UN General Assembly’s annual ministerial meeting that Iran is seeking to undermine regional security since it signed a nuclear agreement with the P5+1 group of countries last year.

Hitherto, there have been protests like this by foreign employees suffering from the knock-on effects of cuts in state expenditure following the drop in the oil price. In work camps far out in the desert workers complain that, not only have they stopped receiving money owed to them, but they are no longer even receiving supplied of food and electricity.</p><p>But today the cuts are for the first time hitting public sector workers who are Saudi citizens, 70 per cent of whom work for the government.

Nonetheless, Riyadh’s military campaign in Yemen has unsettled US officials. From Washington’s vantage point, Saudi bombardments and blockades have clearly failed to achieve Riyadh’s objectives while only offering extremists opportunities to usurp power within the fog of a civil war. At the heart of Washington and Riyadh’s differences on Yemen are their two contrasting threat perceptions. For Saudi Arabia, Iranian influence via the Houthis poses the gravest menace to the kingdom’s security. For the United States, however, the Islamic State and al-Qaeda represent the most serious threat out of Yemen.</p><p>According to <a href="http://english.aawsat.com/2016/08/article55357264/kerrys-plan-yemen-accepted-government-rejected-rebels">Matthew Tueller</a>, Washington’s ambassador to Yemen, "There is no military solution in Yemen, but a political one." Yet as the Saudis view Ansar Allah as Tehran’s proxy, Kerry’s proposed concessions to the Houthis are dangerous and misguided in the eyes of Riyadh officials, particularly as the rebels step up attacks against the kingdom. Despite Kerry’s efforts to pressure Saudi Arabia to approach Yemen more diplomatically, Washington has unquestionably enabled Riyadh’s military campaign against the Houthis, highlighted by the fact that the US has sold <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security-idUSKCN11D2JQ">$115 billion</a> in arms to the kingdom under Obama’s watch (more than any other US administration).</p><p>America’s next president must recognize how a diplomatic resolution to Yemen’s crisis serves long-term US interests. Effectively countering the Islamic State and al-Qaeda in Yemen requires a unified state to work with as a partner. To achieve this end, Washington must urge all sides in the Yemeni civil war, including the Saudis, to budge from their rigid positions and make necessary compromises.</p><p>However, without blocking arms sales to Saudi Arabia, it is unclear what Washington can do to pressure Riyadh into ceasing its bombing. It is also questionable whether the Houthis and Saleh loyalists will view the US as a legitimate peace broker given Washington’s tacit, albeit crucial, support for Riyadh’s campaign in Yemen. Finally, as the US military is engaged in operations against the Islamic State in Libya, Iraq and Syria, it remains to be seen how much attention Obama’s successor will pay to Yemen.</p><p><a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/09/yemen-war-saudi-arabia-washington-president-elections.html">http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/09/yemen-war-saudi-arabia-washington-president-elections.html</a></p><p>27.9.2016 – The Independent (* A P)</p><p>Watching Trump and Clinton debate Isis from my home in the Middle East was as predictable as it was absurd</p><p>'We have to knock the hell out of Isis – and we have to do it fast,' Trump told the world.

When examined alongside a similar backlash taking place in the United Kingdom, it becomes clear that the human toll caused by Saudi air strikes has widened the rift between it and its long-standing allies in the West.

All five of these wars now involve ISIS to some degree.</p><p>Neither Trump nor Clinton have seriously addressed U.S. policy for any of these five wars, and the Obama Administration has not publically stated its grand strategy for any conflict.</p><p>This lack of attention to America’s wars is dangerous in the case of all its wars, but it is particularly dangerous in the case of Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen. The United States is supporting a very different mix of forces in each country in different ways with what seems to be one narrow goal: denying ISIS the ability to control territory or the ability to establish some form of government and sanctuary. The key U.S. tools in each war zone mix air power and with U.S. train and assist efforts and arms transfers to local factions.</p><p>There is no prospect in any such war, however, that the United States will win a near term victory in either the broader strategic sense of fully defeating ISIS</p><p>Once again, the United States does not seem to be learning from its past. The real test of victory is never tactical success or even ending a war on favorable military terms, it is what comes next.</p><p>The U.S. backing of the Saudi-UAE led coalition in Yemen is limited largely to support of air operations, intelligence, and targeting data, and is the lowest level of U.S. involvement in its current wars – although a U.S. Marine amphibious force did prevent Iranian convoys from coming to Yemen at one point in the war. Yemen, however, is a military and civil strategic nightmare.</p><p>Any peace is almost certain to be temporary and unstable. Worse, Yemen is so poor, so limited in water, lacking in economic development, so tied to a narco-economy, and so highly populated that it has no clear path towards nation building its various factions can agree upon.</p><p>Yemen’s strategic position at the gates to the Red Sea and long border with Saudi Arabia do make it a potential strategic threat. At least for the foreseeable future, however, the most that one can hope for is to limit and contain its violence and role in terrorism and in the growing tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Any end to conflict is likely to be temporary or illusory, and serious nation building is likely to be impossible. The United States still needs a strategy for both the military and civil side of Yemen’s fighting and instability, and it still has to make hard choices, but the best real-world strategy is likely to be an awkward and unstable mix of containment and finding the least bad options – by Anthony H.

In an environment so hostile to investment, development and operations, we expect the construction sector to remain deflated for some time, after which only volatile and muted recovery can begin. Latest Updates And Structural Trends ■ We expect a resolution to the conflict in Yemen in the coming quarters. Over the long term we highlight the absence of a financially viable Yemeni state unless substantial overseas support is forthcoming. ■ We maintain a pessimistic view of construction industry growth, with an estimate for 2015 of -22.1% and a forecast of about -6% in 2016, with only a modest base affected recovery expected from 2017-2018. We forecast a deep economic recession until 2019. • The Yemeni hydrocarbons sector is at a virtual standstill, with pipelines and refineries under frequent attacks. In 2017 we expect the country to become a net oil importer. • Significant reconstruction and the recommencement of delayed projects are a rare bright spot on the horizon, with Middle Eastern and Asian investors likely to lead the recovery.</p><p><a href="http://www.spi-reports.com/product/462896-yemen+infrastructure+report+q4+2016.html">http://www.spi-reports.com/product/462896-yemen+infrastructure+report+q4+2016.html</a></p><p>28.9.2016 – Finder (A E)</p><p>Here Are Ways To Send Money To Yemen Better</p><p>Send and receive money across the equator in a jiffy to Yemen, Rep.</p><p>It wasn’t always easy to send and receive money across the Equator, but people all over Australia can rest assured it can be done in current times with a quick visit to a bank or money transfer service.</p><p>Although there are limited relations between Australia and Yemen, there are several reasons why it’s important to be able send and receive money between the two.</p><p><a href="https://www.finder.com/international-money-transfers/send-money-to-yemen">https://www.finder.com/international-money-transfers/send-money-to-yemen</a></p><p>26.9.2016 – Aljazeera Centre for Studies (* B P)</p><p>Transformations of Political Islam in Yemen: Revolution to Counter-revolution</p><p>The paper reviews the emergence and process of the Islah (Reform), a Muslim brotherhood party and al-Rashad (Guidance) a Salafi party. These parties, along with other Islamists, have experienced intellectual reassessments amid growing threats targeting the geopolitical future of Yemen. The paper touches on the relation between these parties within the country’s political spectrum and its regional outskirts in the Yemeni post-revolution era.</p><p>The Houthi (Ansarullah) group will not be reviewed since it is a militia-based body founded on sectarian origins linked to several regional powers. In short, it is perceived as one of the counter-revolutionary tools in Yemen.</p><p>Opposition under control: The Yemeni Alliance for Reform is defined as a popular political organization that seeks reform in all walks of life in the light of Islam and its guiding rules. The party’s first political confrontation with deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh occurred during Yemeni presidential elections in 2006.</p><p>Ramifications and transformation: The relation between Islah and the former regime has been marked with conditional support combined with calculated opposition. The popular uprising that broke out have forced decision makers in al-Islah party to respond to their supporters’ demand for deep-rooted changes. Alternatively, al-Rashad party and the Houthi group were ideologically diverse parties, prompting the need for finding out an Islamist party that would challenge al-Islah party.</p><p>After the breakout of the current fighting in Yemen, some Saudi-led alliance countries kept opposing any role to be played by Islah party in Yemen because they had classified the party as being linked to the Muslim Brotherhood group.The Islah party is facing a major challenge posed by some regional powers for dissociating the party from the so-called the “International Muslim Brotherhood Organization”, but a number of party leaders have denied any links to the organization.</p><p>The Salafists engaged in fighting against the Houthis who were backed by Saleh militias, for defending Damaj institute which is run by the group. The Salafists were finally forced to carry arms in the absence of any central government control.</p><p>As for Salafists linked to al-Rashad party union, the group joined political activity when they were about to be annihilated by the Houthi militias after facing imminent collapse. Thus, the party opted to reconciliation and normalization of relations, both at the domestic level and with the Western countries – by Saeed Thabit Saeed</p><p><a href="http://studies.aljazeera.net/en/reports/2016/09/transformations-political-islam-yemen-revolution-counter-revolution-160926100516607.html">http://studies.aljazeera.net/en/reports/2016/09/transformations-political-islam-yemen-revolution-counter-revolution-160926100516607.html</a></p><p>Comment: A clearly anti-Houthi and pro-Islah / pro-Salafist article. It is certainly strange to label the Houthis as “counter-revolutionary” and – as the only of the three parties mentioned here – as “sectarian” and as “militia-based”. The Houthi movement was just a political and religious movement at the time when it was founded. Its intention was the defending of Zaidism in northern Yemen. The Zaidis had been pummelled since decades by Salafists (or Wahabists, that is the same in that case) from Damaj institute which had been founded in Zaidite northern Yemen and was financed by Saudi sponsors, intending to spread Wahabism among Zaidites in Yemen. The Houthis became more and more militarised during the conflict with the central government. And Islah party also has militias – now fighting against the Houthis; these militia therefore often are labelled as pro-Hadi government, “loyalists”, “popular resistance”, what just is incorrect. – Damaj institute was founded for creating unrest in Yemen – as it really did.</p><p>27.9.2016 – AFP (A)</p><p>Brautvater wirft Granaten bei Hochzeit im Jemen</p><p>Ein Brautvater im Jemen hat der Hochzeit seiner Tochter ein tödliches Ende bereitet: Der frühere Offizier warf bei der Feier am Montag zwei Granaten in die Menge, wie ein Behördenvertreter und ein Verwandter am Dienstag mitteilten.
