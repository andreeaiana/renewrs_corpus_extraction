Suffering is palpable everywhere. But it is in the rebel-held highlands of Yemen’s north that the world’s worst humanitarian crisis has taken root and the spectres of cholera, hunger and Saudi airstrikes loom.</p><p>Strikes such as those on Dhamar that could constitute war crimes hit northern Yemen on an alarmingly regular basis. Saada province, the Houthi heartland on Saudi Arabia’s border, is targeted the most. Barely a street in the town of the same name has been left untouched: the post office, central market and countless civilian homes are gone.</p><p>Death comes from above at any time. Over a lunch of chicken, rice and sweet honeyed fatteh, the unmistakable thud of a nearby missile shook the windows of a restaurant. The diners paid no attention to the whine of the Saudi warplane even as it circled back for a second, third and fourth hit.</p><p>The scorched earth strategy has not brought Saudi Arabia any closer to winning this war.</p><p>Some now call Yemen Saudi Arabia’s Vietnam. But the truth is, without a steady supply of weapons, vehicles and technical expertise provided by the UK, US and other western nations, the current stalemate would be even worse for Riyadh.</p><p>Yemenis are well aware of where the bombs that fall on their heads originate from. Technical information and serial numbers from missile parts that survive explosions can easily be traced to western arms manufacturers.</p><p>At the bomb and mine clearance agency in Sana’a, weapons parts recovered from airstrikes glow hot in the sun. Among them are motor parts from four sensors from cluster bombs – explosives illegal under international law because the submunitions inside released on impact cause indiscriminate harm over a large area. The labels say they were made by the US Goodrich Corporation and manufactured in Wolverhampton, UK.</p><p>The Saudi blockade of Houthi Yemen’s airspace and land and sea borders keeps the north on a constant knife edge</p><p>At al-Sabeen women and children’s hospital, Jamila Mohammed Hamad, 36, says cholera now visits her family every year when the rainy season starts. She lost her three-year-old girl last summer. Now she is back in al-Sabeen’s cholera reception tent, praying her two-year-old niece survives. </p><p>Nowhere is the injustice more keenly felt than in Dahyan, the small village in Saada where a year ago a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/09/dozens-dead-in-yemen-as-bus-carrying-children-hit-by-airstrike-icrc">Saudi airstrike targeted a bus full of little boys</a> on their way to a school trip, killing 44 – by Bethan McKernan, Photography by Achilleas Zavallis</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/30/yemenis-living-under-the-shadow-of-death-by-airstrike">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/30/yemenis-living-under-the-shadow-of-death-by-airstrike</a></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Head of the International Expert Group in an interview with "Al-Masdar Online": We scratched the surface of human rights violations in Yemen</strong></p><p>Kamal al-Jandoubi, head of the Group of Leading International and Regional Experts on Yemen (GEE), said the team's reports have scratched the surface of human rights violations in Yemen since September 2014.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Al-Masdar Online, Al-Safari added that the eminent expert group had prioritized investigations based on the seriousness of the alleged crimes and chose to conduct in-depth investigations into symbolic cases of the most egregious violations.</p><p>He noted the difficulties faced by the Group during its previous investigations, and the lack of cooperation of some parties in its second mandate, in addition to the team's inability to reach Yemeni areas.</p><p>Al-Masdar online publishes the transcript of the dialogue with Mr. Kamal Jandoubi, chairman of the eminent expert group, conducted online by colleague Moaz Rajeh:</p><p>- The report said that the de facto authority had shown its willingness to receive the team and investigate violations in their areas of control. Do you think that this position is real or is it just an attempt to achieve a media and political gain, especially after the coalition and the government refused your arrival in Yemen?</p><p>When the parties to the conflict expressed their willingness to cooperate with the eminent expert group, they were already doing so. For example, we were allowed access to parts of Yemen under the control of the government, the coalition, and the de facto authorities in the first year of our term.</p><p>When we asked for access again in the second year, we received no response from the government and the coalition, while the de facto authorities again agreed to visit the expert group. The de facto authorities also responded to questions posed in writing by the eminent expert group (which are available on the website of the Eminent Expert Group).</p><p>The report referred to a number of cases that had not been verified. Are there other cases not addressed in the report?</p><p>We mentioned in our reports that we have scratched the surface of alleged violations in Yemen since September 2014.some cases and specific patterns the Group did not finish its investigations at the time to be included in the report In many of these cases, we have been denied access or other restrictions to reach the level of consideration of something that is certain.</p><p>The Panel of Eminent Experts prioritized investigations based on the seriousness of the alleged crimes and chose to conduct in-depth investigations into symbolic cases of the most egregious violations.</p><p>There are still countless other investigated examples of the areas we have covered, as well as countless other violations that can be investigated if time and resources permit.</p><p>What is based on your reports? What is her fate after she is presented to the Commissioner?</p><p>The report of the Eminent Expert Group refers to cases where the Panel found reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of international law had occurred, including possible international crimes, which, therefore, reached the required standard of proof that would allow the competent authority to conduct further investigation in accidents or related patterns of behavior.</p><p>We hope that the information we have documented will be useful to provide guidance to the investigations of the competent authority, which may consider prosecutions to be part of accountability measures.</p><p>What are the most prominent issues the team will focus on in the coming period?</p><p>We have identified a number of cases in which the Eminent Expert Group has not yet completed its investigations, particularly in some areas where the Panel has been prevented from pursuing its investigations for lack of access or other restrictions, as was the case with Hajjah and Al-Dhale’a.</p><p>In addition, we are closely monitoring the latest developments in the country and will decide on what should focus our investigations.</p><p><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/172076">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/172076</a></p><p>My remark „de facto authorities” is the twisted UN wording for the Houthi government at Sanaa.</p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Just How Swampy Are U.S-Saudi Arms Deals?</strong></p><p>Let's just say that Americans representing the kingdom are making a killing while pushing U.S. jobs overseas.</p><p>The old maxim that “the U.S. government exists to buy arms at home and sell arms abroad” was never truer than today. Our defense budget is soaring to previously undreamed-of heights and overseas weapons deals are setting new records.</p><p>Indeed, the arms sales industry has become so multi-faceted that while some American corporations push weapons, other U.S. firms are making money by acting on behalf of the buyers. Thus a Lockheed Martin-Raytheon team recently dispatched to Riyadh <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/politics/saudi-arabia-missile-purchase/index.html">to negotiate the finer points</a> of the ongoing $15 billion deal for seven Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries jointly manufactured by the two companies, found themselves facing not Saudis across the table, but a team of executives from the Boston Consulting Group. This behemoth, which has $7.5 billion in global revenues, is just one of the firms servicing Mohammed “Bone Saw” Bin Salman’s vicious and spendthrift consolidation of power in the kingdom. </p><p>Among other lucrative revenue streams, BCG enjoys a contract <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/world/middleeast/mckinsey-bcg-booz-allen-saudi-khashoggi.html">to overhaul the defense ministry’s arms buying practices,</a> a challenging task given the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of weapons MBS has on order. </p><p>For arms dealers doing business in the kingdom, the most visible overhaul to date has been the consolidation of control over Saudi weapons purchases, and all branches of the armed forces, in the hands of MBS himself. </p><p>Previously, <a href="http://jcpa.org/article/arms-for-the-king-and-his-family-the-u-s-arms-sale-to-saudi-arabia/">control in this area had been distributed</a> among different factions of the ruling family, thus enabling each to enjoy the financial rewards (read: kickbacks) traditionally attendant to such deals. But MBS has made it his business, in every sense of the word, to cut out potentially rival middlemen by centralizing all Saudi defense business under the umbrella of the <a href="https://www.intelligenceonline.com/international-dealmaking/2019/06/05/business-heavyweights-beef-up-gami-mohammed-bin-salman-s-military-procurement-authority,108359990-art">General Authority of Military Industries,</a> with management in the trustworthy (he hopes) hands of close relatives and henchmen such as Mutlaq bin Hamad Al Murashid<a href="https://www.intelligenceonline.com/international-dealmaking/2019/06/05/business-heavyweights-beef-up-gami-mohammed-bin-salman-s-military-procurement-authority,108359990-art">,</a> the Princeton-trained nuclear engineer charged with developing the Saudi nuclear program.</p><p>The Boston Group has cultivated a market in advising foreign governments on arms buying, promoting the fostering of their own military-industrial complexes, or, as BCG executives demurely expressed the strategy in a <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/arming-defense-companies-for-global-growth.aspx">2018 paper</a>: “Unlike the way business was done in the past, today’s buyers want the defense contractor to invest in their country’s infrastructure, help develop their local defense capabilities, and diversify their economies.”</p><p><span>So-called </span><a href="https://fas.org/asmp/campaigns/offset.html">“offset” agreements</a><span> have long been a feature of major weapons export deals in which the exporter undertakes to award sub-contracts for the weapon system in the purchasing country, or else offer some other quid quo pro in the form of business or technology transfer</span>. Their massive expansion<span> in recent times</span>, as highlighted in the BCG paper, brings an additional benefit for all parties involved. But it comes at a risk of sending U.S. defense jobs overseas, and opens up security vulnerabilities, since sensitive technology is now being shared with foreign arms manufacturers abroad.</p><p>But <span>the promise of a lucrative offset contract to a company in which an influential figure on the buy side has an interest could be a powerful inducement to swing the decision in a favorable direction, </span>an elegant solution to pesky prohibitions against bribery, including the hated 1977 <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.asp">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</a> that was inspired in part by revelations of arms-deals bribes by Lockheed and others</p><p>Even if the attackers had been obliging enough to send in ballistic missiles with a high-altitude trajectory, the THAAD would have offered little succor, since its infra-red seeker, as noted, cannot distinguish between actual warheads and decoys. Nor would the Russian S-400 system cheekily offered by Putin in the aftermath of the attack have fared better, and for many of the same reasons.</p><p>Such realities have found little place in the outpouring of commentary on the attacks, with little or no attention paid to easily available evidence. For example, published pictures of the damage at Abqaiq clearly show a number of liquified natural gas storage tanks pierced in the same place on their western sides. As former Pentagon analyst Pierre Sprey pointed out to me, this clearly shows that the attacks came from the west, not the north, as claimed in numerous media reports.</p><p>The consistent accuracy demonstrated by these impact holes indicates that the terminal guidance was not GPS, <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/was-iran-really-behind-attack-saudi-aramco-facilities/5689890">but rather human drone controllers,</a> manually steering the slow flying drones, via the drones’ video cameras, into the target. For control purposes they would have to have been in line of sight to the drones (the only alternative would be an easily detectable satellite link) so they could have been no further than 36 miles away at most, assuming the drones were flying at a likely 300 feet altitude. </p><p>Instead of such cogent analysis, we have been presented with unquestioning reports of Saudi “evidence” that the attacks came directly from Iran in the form of pictures of an alleged wrecked Iranian drone discovered somewhere close to the targeted area – by Patrick Cockburn</p><p><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/u-s-firms-cash-in-on-both-sides-of-saudi-arms-deals/">https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/u-s-firms-cash-in-on-both-sides-of-saudi-arms-deals/</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2><p>(* B H)</p><p>Choleraepidemie: Dramatische Lage im Jemen</p><p>Die Lage im Jemen hat sich wegen der steigenden Zahl von Cholera-Erkrankungen dramatisch verschlechtert.

Many of the men, who apparently surrendered to the rebels, were dressed in flip flops and the traditional, sarong-like clothing worn in Yemen and parts of Saudi Arabia. A handful wore tan camouflage uniforms. At least two of the men said on camera that they were citizens of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Other images showed burning armored vehicles with Saudi markings and weapons that the Houthis said they seized. Houthi fighters also are shown apparently launching attacks on coalition troops, clashes that left what appears to be corpses in Saudi military uniforms.</p><p>The Washington Post could not independently verify any of the images.</p><p>If claims about the attack are found to be credible, it is certain to fuel more concerns in Washington and Riyadh that Iran is behind the rebels’ growing military capabilities, which in recent months have included numerous drone and cruise missile attacks on Saudi soil.</p><p>It also would help bring credibility to the Houthis’ claims that they had orchestrated the largest ever assault on Saudi oil facilities, on Sept. 14, which temporarily shut down oil production and rattled the global economy.

It is why Al-Manar, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/AlmanarEnglish/status/1178293478675144704">close to Hezbollah</a>, is so excited. It is why Fars News in Farsi has broadcast the <a href="https://twitter.com/FarsNews_Agency/status/1178294025905942529">same video</a> of the captured men being paraded away from the battlefield, looking more like French at Dienbienphi surrendering to the Vietnamese, than a modern war.

The sheer number of destroyed vehicles shown on videos cannot be hidden for long if it <a href="https://twitter.com/SEEKINGTHETRU17/status/1178321317529038848">all happened</a> in one day.</p><p>The Najran attacks, and the frequent drone and missile attacks on Abha in southern Saudi Arabia is designed to do the same. It is about taking the war to Saudi Arabia and asserting the power of Iranian technology and Iranian advisors. If the Houthis are doing all this themselves they may be the strongest group of infantry since the Spartans. But they aren’t. They are the foot soldiers and Iranian technology has helped them become a formidable fighting force, able to withstand four years of siege and battle against not only Riyadh but also its allies.<br /> There is no reason the Houthis should have been able to accomplish this, but there was no reason the Vietminh should have outdone the French inn 1954. But they did.

Furthermore, air support and air-defense systems would be necessary to ward off American and Saudi responses. In addition to all this, troops and their equipment are needed together with the necessary training for such assaults that require coordination as well as quick and effective execution of orders. All these requirements were met as a result of the excellent preparation and knowledge of the terrain by the Yemeni army and the Houthis.</p><p>If the attack on Saudi oil facilities had such an impact, then the even more dramatic attack of this last Saturday will have forced Mohammed bin Salman and his American allies to face a very harsh reality. Saudi Arabia, it will now need to be recognized, does not have the capacity to defend its borders from Yemen, leaving the Houthis and the Yemeni army free to enter Saudi territory at will while showing little regard for the opinion and feelings of the Saudis and Americans.</p><p>This is a triple checkmate for the Houthis against Riyadh. Firstly, they showed that they had enough local support within Saudi Arabia to have ready internal saboteurs in the event of an all-out war with Iran or Yemen. Then they showed they have the capacity to cripple Saudi Arabia’s oil production. Ultimately, Yemen’s conventional forces could redraw the boundaries between Saudi Arabia and Yemen in the latter’s favor should Yemeni leaders decide to invade and occupy a strip of Saudi territory to secure a buffer zone, given that Saudi forces have been violating Yemen’s sovereignty and massacring civilians willy nilly for the last five years.</p><p>It bears reflecting on the significance of these events.

others.</p><p>According to human rights activists, the careless of the United Nations and international organizations in holding the coalition forces accountable for their crimes against Yemenis,

European officials since they had no “grasp of the Yemenis’ capacity,” and had always denigrated the impoverished Arab country, says a political analyst from Washington.</p><p>“The Europeans and Americans don’t have any grasp of the Yemenis’ capacity, the Europeans and Americans denigrate the Yemenis… They think they are too stupid to fight back, yet they have been fighting for some four and a half years, they think they are too stupid to deal with modern weapons,” Michael Springmann, a Washington-based author and former US diplomat in Saudi Arabia, said at a Friday edition of Press TV’s The Debate program.</p><p>“Who knows where the weapons came from, they have just shown that the Saudis and the American defenses and the multi-billion-dollar 21 century weapons that have been sold to them are useless if a group of disgruntled, poor, starving Yemenis get around them and strike at the heart of the Saudi economy,” Springmann added.</p><p>The Washington-based author also noted that the Europeans had no choice but to join the United States in pointing the finger of blame at Iran for the attacks since they are dependent on the US and Israel in the fields of politics and security.</p><p>“The Europeans don’t know [who was behind the attack] but follow the lead of the United States because the Europeans are weak on political independence and security independence; they are far too tied to the United States, they are far too tied to Israel,” Springmann said.</p><p>Michael Lane, the founder of the American Institute for Foreign Policy in Washington, was the other panelist on the program and said US accusations leveled against Tehran was “part of the entire array of pressure that the United States is putting on the economy of Iran.” (with interviews in

Der Krieg hat die Situation von Frauen verschlechtert. Dennoch besteht laut Frauenrechtlerin Suha Basharen Hoffnung.</p><p>Beruflich bedeutet der Krieg für Basharen, dass sie versucht, den Jemen trotz aller Widrigkeiten in ein besseres Land für Frauen zu verwandeln und Frauen dort Perspektiven aufzuzeigen. Als Frauenrechtsexpertin der internationalen Hilfsorganisation "Care" arbeitet sie daran, soziale und kulturelle Normen in ihrem Heimatland zu verändern. Wichtige Bereiche von Basharens Tätigkeit sind etwa Bildung in Sachen Gesundheit, die aktive Einbindung von Frauen in Friedensbemühungen sowie Ernährungssicherheit. Auch wenn der Krieg schrecklich sei, erklärt sie, eröffneten sich durch die Situation dennoch auch neue Möglichkeiten für Jemenitinnen.</p><p>"In großen Teilen des Jemens ist die Norm, dass Frauen sich um den Haushalt kümmern und Männer das Geld verdienen", so Basharen. "Das soll keine Entschuldigung für häusliche Gewalt sein, aber wenn diese Aufteilung nicht mehr weitergeführt werden kann, sorgt das oft für Frust. Die häusliche Gewalt hat während des Krieges zugenommen." Laut dem Bevölkerungsfonds der Vereinten Nationen (UNFPA) sind mehr als drei Millionen jemenitische Frauen und Mädchen gefährdet, Opfer geschlechtsbezogener Gewalt zu werden.</p><p>Basharen zufolge nehmen manche Familien nur noch eine Mahlzeit am Tag ein. "Sie wissen nicht, wann es das nächste Mal etwas geben wird." Zudem äßen oft zuerst die Männer und dann erst die Frauen, so dass manchmal nichts für sie übrig bleibe.

While observers claimed the Quds 1 was merely a Soumar smuggled directly from Iran, the missile has been changed by the Houthis. “This leaves the question of just who developed and built the Quds 1. The idea that impoverished war-torn Yemen would be able to develop a cruise missile without any outside assistance seems far-fetched.” Indeed.</p><p>The Houthis also have an arsenal of “Burkan” missiles that are alleged to be modified Soviet R-17E Scud rockets, according to a piece at The National Interest. </p><p>The Houthis, despite being isolated, certainly seem to have access to all sorts of goodies. The Quds 1 has a Czech TJ100 engine, according to reports. These engines are apparently ideal for drones or UAVs. They’ve been spotted on Iranian-made drones, the website Ars Technica says</p><p>The array of Yemeni drones and missiles, including their increasing use against Saudi Arabia shows that the Houthis are able to operate a sophisticated industrial production line for drones, or that they have found a way to easily smuggle them from Iran.

So zumindest klingt es in einem Trailer des Politmagazins »Frontline«, den der öffentlich-rechtliche US-Sender PBS auf seiner Homepage teilte. Für Dienstag ist die gesamte Dokumentation über den Thronnachfolger ankündigt.</p><p>»Es geschah unter meiner Verantwortung«, sagte der Kronprinz, auch wenn er nicht in das Komplott eingeweiht gewesen sei. Er könne eben nicht alles mitbekommen: »Wir haben 20 Millionen Menschen. Wir haben drei Millionen Regierungsangestellte.« Er wisse auch nicht immer, wer, wann, welche Flugzeuge benutze. »Ich habe dafür Offizielle, Minister, die diese Dinge verfolgen, und sie sind verantwortlich.«</p><p>In dem Trailer ist der Prinz nicht im O-Ton zu hören, seine Aussagen sind nur eingeblendet. Außerdem stammen die Äußerungen vom Dezember letzten Jahres. Das Gespräch fand laut »Frontline«-Journalisten Martin Smith in der Nähe von Riad statt, am Rande eines Rennens für Elektroauto, anscheinend ohne Kamera und Aufnahmegerät.</p><p>Vielleicht kommt die Sendung aber auch zwei Tage zu spät, denn der US-Sender CBS kündigte für den gestrigen Sonntag ein 60minütiges Interview mit Mohammed Bin Salman an. Möglicherweise hat der designierte König dort nach jW-Redaktionsschluss seine Aussagen vom Dezember wiederholt.</p><p><a href="https://www.jungewelt.de/artikel/363825.sand-in-die-augen.html">https://www.jungewelt.de/artikel/363825.sand-in-die-augen.html</a></p><p><span>(* A B P)</span></p><p>CIA Intercepts Underpin Assessment Saudi Crown Prince Targeted Khashoggi</p><p>Conclusion that Prince Mohammed bin Salman ‘probably ordered’ killing relies in part on 11 messages he sent to adviser who oversaw hit squad around time it killed journalist</p><p>How did the CIA conclude that journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed on the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman?

Maher Mutreb, the alleged ringleader on the ground, was on the crown prince’s personal security detail.</p><p>Smith also pressed Jubeir about the crown prince’s ties to Mutreb, Qahtani and the murder in the above exchange from The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“You went on television on FOX News on October 21 — and you said that none of those involved in Khashoggi’s death had close ties to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman,” Smith says.</p><p>“Because he has … these were security individuals. Security people have rotations, they sometimes serve — for specific times in terms of security or other issues,” Jubeir says.</p><p>“But these weren’t just security individuals,” Smith counters. “Mutreb, who traveled extensively with the crown prince, including in the United States, was on the scene. Are you saying that you didn’t know that the people that were involved in the murder were close to the crown prince at the time that you said that?”</p><p>“They — the crown prince has a lot of people who are close to him or who claim to be close to him. He has a lot of people who take their pictures with him,” Jubeir responds.</p><p>“You’re asking all these questions,” Jubeir says when Smith went on to ask him about Qahtani.</p><p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/frontline-raises-serious-questions-about-jamal-khashoggis-murder-in-contentious-interviews/">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/frontline-raises-serious-questions-about-jamal-khashoggis-murder-in-contentious-interviews/</a></p><p><span>Snippet: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/walid970721/status/1178105517262213121">https://twitter.com/walid970721/status/1178105517262213121</a></p><p><span>Comment: </span><span>Clips of trembling, panicked </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlJubeir?src=hashtag_click"><span>#AlJubeir</span></a><span> trying to defend the indefensible lies about </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JamalKhashoggi?src=hashtag_click"><span>#JamalKhashoggi</span></a><span> followed by betrayer Turki covering up the murder of his close friend of decades -- what a sight to see!</span></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahleah1/status/1178089507092078593">https://twitter.com/sarahleah1/status/1178089507092078593</a></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Call for justice in the US one year after Khashoggi's murder</p><p>Fiancee of murdered journalist says Saudi crown prince's statement on 2018 killing 'pure political manoeuvre'.</p><p>The fiancee of murdered Saudi journalist <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/jamal-khashoggi.html">Jamal Khashoggi</a> and the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html">United Nations</a> official who investigated his killing made an impassioned plea for justice on Thursday, days before the first anniversary of his death.</p><p>UN rapporteur <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/khashoggi-killing-rapporteur-callamard-present-report-190626070023848.html">Agnes Callamard</a>, who investigated the murder, urged Cengiz and others to be "patient and resilient", saying justice would only be won after a "long haul" given the current geopolitical climate.</p><p>"Accountability is not delivered in 12 months, that's summary justice.

They demanded that Iran fully comply with the nuclear deal Trump scrapped last year and “refrain from choosing provocation and escalation.”</p><p>As Washington dispatches troops to Saudi Arabia and warships to the Persian Gulf to prepare war against Iran, the content of this statement is unambiguous. The leading European imperialist powers are abandoning their initial criticisms of Trump for scrapping the 2015 treaty.</p><p>The European endorsement of US war threats against Iran will not strengthen peace, but encourage the Trump administration to step up its threats and provocations, risking a catastrophic war.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/09/25/euir-s25.html">https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/09/25/euir-s25.html</a></p><p>(* B K P)</p><p>Saudi Arabia will not go to war against Iran on its own</p><p>Moreover, in response to a question after a meeting with Bahrain’s Crown Prince on 16 September, Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-crown-prince-salman-bahrain-bilateral-meeting/">said</a> that he had not promised to protect the Saudis: “No, I haven’t. No, I haven’t. I haven’t promised the Saudis that. We have to sit down with the Saudis and work something out, and the Saudis want very much for us to protect them, but I say, well, we have to work.”</p><p>If there is a red line for Trump, then that seems to be American lives.</p><p>The question is, if Iran is proven to be behind the attack, how will the Saudis respond? They have failed to contain the Houthis in Yemen with the help of a coalition of several countries, plus US weapons and logistical support. If they couldn’t do that, how will they contain Iran if they respond on their own? It is impossible for them to enter such a conflict without help. Trump, though, is unlikely to get into a war, and the same can be said about the UAE, which has been getting closer to Tehran.</p><p>Some may argue that even if the US enters the conflict, Riyadh is aware of the consequences.</p><p>If there is to be a Saudi military response, regardless of who was really behind the Aramco attack, then it may be against one of Iran’s proxies.

The Hadi government tries to get the money from selling this stuff, the Houthis refuse, as it’s on their territory.</p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>The Houthis cover up for Iran. Here is why.</p><p>Regardless of the origin of the attacks, it is clear that Iran was the mastermind of the operation. By claiming responsibility for the attacks, the Houthis have demonstrated that Iran is their priority – and that they are prepared to put Yemen at risk of retaliation for the greater goal of Iran’s regional project.</p><p>Iran has a clear motive. Tehran has repeatedly threatened to disrupt the flow of oil in the region with attacks in response to US sanctions, part of Washington’s “maximum economic pressure” campaign to counter Tehran’s malign role in the Middle East. President Hassan Rouhani <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-oil/irans-rouhani-hints-at-threat-to-neighbors-exports-if-oil-sales-halted-idUSKBN1JT0NB">explicitly threatened</a> to affect “neighboring countries’” oil exports as sanctions s</p><p>Given what we know about the attacks, it is clear that the Houthis are covering up for Iran. Even in the likelihood that experts cannot confirm the origin of the attacks, it should be a given that the Houthis have claimed them on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).</p><p>This is not the first time the Houthis have claimed an attack which they did not conduct. </p><p>But why are the Houthis agreeing to cover for Iran? There are three main reasons.</p><p>First, the Houthis cannot say no to Iran, their most important financial and military backer.
