The principal belligerents on one side – Saudi Arabia and until recently the United Arab Emirates, heavily backed by the United States and the United Kingdom – are by far also the largest contributors to the humanitarian relief effort. This allows them to say they are saving Yemeni lives on the one hand while taking them with the other, to say they are feeding Yemen while destroying the economy and infrastructure by which the country might feed itself. Were Yemen to fall into widespread famine, the war would become untenable among the ‘international community’, and thus providing relief funds is self-serving for these belligerents, allowing them to continue prosecuting the conflict in search of their desired ends. </p><p>Given that the majority of Yemen’s population lives in the north most of this aid has gone to areas controlled by the other side. The armed Houthi movement has so thoroughly corralled United Nations agencies and aid organizations that the relief effort, worth almost US$4 billion in 2019 alone, now forms a critical source of rent and influence for the group’s own war effort. This situation came about as a result of the UN and aid organizations progressively and profoundly surrendering their humanitarian principles to try and secure access to needy populations. In doing so, however, these humanitarian actors have reluctantly been providing hefty subsidies for Houthi operations – which include weaponizing starvation, recruiting child soldiers, planting millions of landmines in civilian areas, sexual violence and mass campaigns of arrest and torture.</p><p>Humanitarian workers, speaking to the Sana’a Center, have described how, once international aid enters northern areas, the Houthi authorities essentially dictate to UN agencies and international non-governmental organizations the terms of how it is stored and transported, where and when it is distributed, and to whom. Houthi forces have used their control over access to aid, or the threat of its denial, as a means to recruit soldiers from hungry communities in Yemen, to reward support or punish dissent in northern areas, and for cash income through selling the aid supplies on the market. At times corruption has also taken hold within the aid effort itself, with The Associated Press last year revealing a scheme by a small group of foreign staff to embezzle millions of dollars from the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, UN and INGO attempts to verify aid recipients, monitor distribution and even collect basic data for population needs assessments are made nearly impossible due to Houthi-imposed bureaucratic delays, access restrictions and permit denials.</p><p>While the UN regularly publishes numbers regarding how many millions of people in Yemen are facing imminent famine, food insecure or otherwise in humanitarian need, it has been extremely difficult to verify these statistics with on-the-ground surveys. Indeed, <span><a href="https://fic.tufts.edu/publication-item/complexities-of-information-and-analysis-in-humanitarian-emergencies-evidence-in-yemen/">evidence</a></span> suggests that in some locations needs have been inflated to garner more resources, while at the same time other areas remain overlooked and underserved. Put another way, no definitive data actually exists to confirm the often-stated claim that Yemen is “the world’s largest humanitarian crisis”, though it may be the world’s worst humanitarian response. </p><p>There is without question immense humanitarian need in Yemen; however, many UN and INGO staff on the ground – the people in the best position to know – have lost confidence that the relief effort, as it is currently being conducted, is helping the situation. At best, it is offering a few Yemenis the brief reprieve humanitarian aid is meant to provide, but in exchange for indefinite suffering through a drawn-out conflict.</p><p>Recent international threats to withdraw aid funds from northern areas if the Houthi authorities do not loosen their throttle hold over the relief effort have shown a degree of success – such as getting the Houthis to agree to back down on a proposed 2 percent tax on all humanitarian operations, though indications are that the Houthis are pursuing other avenues to recoup these funds from relief agencies. And even here the response of the humanitarian actors is ethically fraught. It is because the United Nations had been so fearful of losing access that the humanitarian effort became so compromised, and the UN only began to meaningfully confront the Houthis last year after it was forced to by media reports exposing the rampant and systematic theft of food aid.</p><p>While the heads of UN agencies were confronted with crushing responsibility and immensely difficult choices during the Yemen conflict, they are also meant to be the standard bearers of humanitarian principles in the world. In this, the UN abdicated its responsibility in Yemen. Into this vacuum, the donors – the largest of whom are active belligerents on one side of this conflict – are now stepping in. This sets a new, dangerous precedent and further erodes the UN’s ability to direct a needs-based relief effort that is autonomous from the objectives – political, economic, military or otherwise – of actors in this war – by Sanaa Center</p><p><span><a

Aid Interference Prompts Threats to Cut Funding</strong></p><p>Mounting disputes between aid agencies and Houthi authorities in Sana’a that have severely impeded the relief effort and a donor rebellion could result in deep cuts to vital humanitarian aid. Large donors along with UN agencies and other international NGOs who met February 13 in Brussels said the situation “has reached a <span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/echo/news/humanitarian-community-reaffirms-commitment-yemen_en">breaking point</a></span>,” as <span><a href="https://apnews.com/edb2cad767ccbf898c220e54c199b6d9">an investigation</a></span> by The Associated Press revealed details of the extent of Houthi demands and past UN acquiescence to them.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/9098#Jan_Feb_Endnotes"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span> </p><p>An aid worker who manages programs in Yemen for an international non-governmental organization (INGO) told the Sana’a Center that UN agencies had ceded too much control to Houthi authorities throughout the conflict; UN food aid delivered to Hudaydah port had been transported by Houthi affiliates and stored in a warehouse belonging to the Houthi-run Education Ministry.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/9098#Jan_Feb_Endnotes"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span> Houthi authorities also were granted excessive influence over beneficiary lists and distribution, while the UN lacked staff on the ground to monitor distribution or verify needs, the aid worker said on condition of anonymity due to fear of repercussions. </p><p>Houthi restrictions on visas, travel and supplies create an extremely difficult operating environment, the aid worker said. Securing visas for international humanitarian staff requires permission from the Houthi-run Supreme Council for the Management and Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and International Cooperation (SCMCHA), health ministry and national security; these bodies often are not aligned, and if one rejects the application, the process must begin again. The process takes up to six months, sometimes culminating with a refusal for absurd reasons, while Houthi authorities frequently lose papers, according to the aid worker. Meanwhile, to travel within Yemen, staff must request a travel permit from Houthi authorities a week in advance.</p><p>The internationally recognized government requires international humanitarian staff entering any part of Yemen to obtain a visa from their authorities, a process that usually takes 24 hours, but the government refuses visas for Lebanese, Iraqis, Iranians and Syrians. Meanwhile, Houthi authorities refuse visas to anyone who has been to Gaza. Combined, these restrictions limit the pool of staff that the sector can recruit from, the aid worker explained.</p><p>Obtaining permission from Houthi authorities to bring in humanitarian supplies can take up to six months, sometimes past the shelf-life of the food or medicine being imported. Houthi authorities insist INGOs use Houthi trucks to transport supplies, creating another stream of income for the Houthis through transport fees. Further, Houthi authorities raised social security deductions on humanitarian staff’s salaries from 15 to 18 percent; organizations that do not pay risk refusals for visas and travel permits, the aid worker said. </p><p>To attend training abroad, humanitarian staff must obtain authorization from the Houthis; this requires presenting the training curriculum and attending an interview with Houthi officials who decide whether or not to allow the staff member to attend. A recent restriction imposed by SCMCHA forbids INGO staff from meeting with any Houthi authorities or officials except SCMCHA, according to the aid worker.</p><p>UN and INGO officials had said little publicly about details of their dispute and past cooperation and financial arrangements with the Houthi authorities. However, Mark Lowcock, the UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-mark-26">briefed the UN Security Council</a></span> in open session on the issue February 18, the day before The Associated Press <span><a href="https://apnews.com/edb2cad767ccbf898c220e54c199b6d9">published an investigation</a></span> into the situation.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/9098#Jan_Feb_Endnotes"><sup>[3]</sup></a></span> The AP investigation, based on dozens of documents and interviews with anonymous aid officials who said they feared reprisals for speaking out, found that:</p><p>UN agencies have refused to sign agreements to accept the new directives. In his UN Security Council briefing, Lowcock cited issues with both sides in the conflict but described “much more serious problems” in Houthi-controlled areas.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/9098#Jan_Feb_Endnotes"><sup>[4]</sup></a></span> He confirmed the 200-plus new directives and said that by the end of 2019, incidents of Houthi disruption of assistance were six times greater than at the start of the year. Lowcock characterized half of the incidents as constraints on movement of staff or supplies and said about a quarter involved trying to influence aid decisions or otherwise interfere in programs.

Washington’s subservience to the Saudi royal family, whose regime shares few interests and even fewer values with America, has made the U.S. complicit in tens of thousands of needless deaths.</p><p>The Trump administration recently demonstrated a particularly toxic mix of hypocrisy and sanctimony regarding Yemen. The Pentagon complained that naval seizures by American patrols working on behalf of the Saudis had captured blasting caps for improvised explosive devices and components of anti-tank, anti-ship, and anti-aircraft missiles. The latter, called 358s, are known as “loitering” missiles, containing two different motors and avoiding normal defensive measures. An unnamed Pentagon official complained to the New York Times that the 358s could down American helicopters and tilt-wing Ospreys—though why that matters is unclear, since Washington supposedly is not running combat missions in Yemen.</p><p>Captain Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, charged: “They are illicitly smuggled for a purpose and that purpose is to spread lethal assistance to the Houthis, to Iranian proxies, there’s not a plausible explanation on how these weapons got on to a vessel in Yemen without the sanction of the Iranian government.” </p><p>With no hint of irony, he complained that Tehran had been arming the Houthis since the war’s start—when Saudi Arabia invaded Yemen—and had thereby prolonged the fighting. That is, Iran’s assistance enabled the Yemenis to defend themselves from their much richer and better armed adversary, which was supplied and otherwise aided by the U.S.</p><p>For decades, Washington has allowed Saudi Arabia to essentially hire out the American military as royal bodyguard. The Kingdom is an absolute monarchy without even a hint of religious or political liberty</p><p>Washington has sold billions of dollars’ worth of aircraft and munitions to Riyadh and the UAE. The Pentagon also provides intelligence assistance to the Saudis in choosing their Yemeni targets, which itself raises serious questions since the royals appear to have intentionally struck civilians. For years, the U.S. military has also refueled Saudi aircraft engaged in bombing Yemen sites, including apartments, hospitals, weddings, funerals, school buses, and commercial sites. </p><p>Of course, Riyadh’s culpability and cant are greater than Washington’s. American officials are aiding and abetting murder; Saudi officials are engaging in it. Riyadh announced that it had recently intercepted missile attacks on Saudi cities. Saudi spokesman Turki al-Malki piously complained: “They were launched in a systematic, deliberate manner to target cities and civilians, which is a flagrant defiance of international humanitarian law.” Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, he said, “has become a Houthi militia assembly, installation and launching-hub for ballistic missiles that target the kingdom.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Malki failed to mention that he represents one of the world’s richest nations, which attacked one of the poorest.</p><p>Another perverse result of Washington’s support for Saudi tyranny has been the unintended transfer of U.S. weapons to Islamist radicals, as well as Yemeni Houthis and Iran.</p><p>Area specialists emphasize that the Houthis have never been tools of Tehran. Never friends of America either, they turned to Iran for aid because they had no choice. After all, their well-funded enemies enjoyed the patronage of the United States, the world’s most powerful nation. The Obama administration apparently backed the Saudi royals’ aggression as a pay-off, since the latter were upset with the nuclear deal with Iran. Washington hoped to buy the Saudis’ favor by underwriting their brutal war. President Trump tore up the Iran deal but continued the deadly aid, choosing the worst possible policy on both counts.</p><p>The Persian Gulf matters much less to America these days: Israel is a regional superpower and the oil markets have diversified. </p><p>The administration should end America’s participation in such an unjust, unnecessary war. That would encourage Riyadh to accelerate discussions with the Houthis in search of a diplomatic settlement. But America’s policy also shouldn’t depend on the Saudi position.

While they may not always describe their work in such terms, women are already laying foundations for sustainable peace through everyday practices that have the capacity to help transform the landscape of women’s rights in the post-war period. Wider recognition of women’s paid and unpaid work in wartime, and the conditions that enable it, could improve the social cohesion, economic stability, and human security necessary for sustainable peace, consistent with the priorities of UN Resolution 1325. Based on interviews and focus groups conducted in the summer and fall of 2019, this Brief reviews variations in women’s experience of conflict and participation in everyday peacebuilding in different parts of the country, advocates for an entitlement-based approach that recognizes women’s agency, supports women’s diverse aims, and works to leverage their existing contributions in support of sustainable peace.</p><p>From Introduction</p><p>This Brief focuses on the contributions of Yemeni women to six core areas central to supporting sustainable peace: the economy, society and culture, politics, education, security and justice, and the environment. It is part of ’Research Cooperation on Peacebuilding in Yemen’, a wider project that encourages Yemeni-international research cooperation on peace requirements in Yemen. CARPO is implementing the entire project on behalf of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and by commission of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).</p><p>The greatest challenge facing Yemeni women today is undoubtedly the war’s sustained toll on an already impoverished economy: This was the resounding message voiced across all parts of the country in which research for this paper was conducted. And yet, as our research and similar studies clearly show, economic insecurity is also a core driver of women’s changing social, economic, and even political roles.2 Humanitarian assistance and relief efforts have tapped some of this potential, but largely by approaching wom- en only as conduits of essential services or providers of essential data for needs assess- ment. We see the work of Yemeni women as contributing much more.</p><p>Examining the diverse roles that women are playing in their communities across a range of wartime conditions and in rural and urban settings, it is clear, in the words of one activist,</p><p>that “the war in Yemen is not something that is simply happening to Yemeni women.”3 Indeed, the vitality of many communities depends on the work, paid and unpaid, that women are doing, much of which contributes to the conditions that support sustainable peace. But this work is not without risk; across the country, women face constraints driven by insecurity and the prevalence of armed actors.</p><p><span><a href="https://carpo-bonn.org/en/portfolio/carpo-brief-14-the-role-of-women-in-peacebuilding-in-yemen/">https://carpo-bonn.org/en/portfolio/carpo-brief-14-the-role-of-women-in-peacebuilding-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p>full document: <span><a href="https://carpo-bonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/carpo_brief_14.pdf">https://carpo-bonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/carpo_brief_14.pdf</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p><p><strong>Two options for patients: dying on their beds or on the way to Seiyun or Aden</strong></p><p>The international humanitarian promises to reopen Sana’a International Airport have resulted in only more deaths.</p><p>Besides, there is nothing new in this regard except the waiting agonies of medical patients, some of whom have changed their flights to the graves after they lost hope to fly for medical care outside the country.</p><p>Some of these patients are still clinging to the hope of flying through Sana’a airport that has been closed for four years. However, the health status of some stranded patients is horrifically deteriorating.</p><p>In November 2019, the Saudi/UAE-led coalition spokesman of announced the re-launch of humanitarian flights to airlift medical patients from and to Sana’a International Airport, and since then, <span><a href="https://twitter.com/WHOEMRO/status/1227119364756910080">only 24 patients</a></span> were evacuated.</p><p>Last October, one patient who has medical reports eligible for treatment abroad was informed to come to Sana’a so that they are airlifted by the World Health Organization to Cairo in batches. Accordingly, 33 patients and 33 of their companions had already arrived to the airport as a first batch. Yet, the plane changed its route before landing in Sana’a Airport.</p><p>Thus, the feet of these patients stumbled at the gate of Sana’a International Airport and returned to one of the capital Sana’a’s hotels with hopes and reassurances, waiting for their flight from day to another until the moment. According to the head of the High Medical Committee in Sana’a, Dr. Mutahar Al-Darwish, the number of cases registered in the medical committee’s records reached 3,000 cases of those who do not have opportunities to be treated in-country due to their difficult health conditions and poor resources. He said that there are 30,000 cases with incurable diseases registered at the health centers and hospitals need treatment abroad. .Dr. Al-Darwish stated that, unfortunately, many of the registered cases died.</p><p>He added: “The World Health Organization asked us to review the files of the cases accepted by the out-country hospitals, 600 cases, to know the developments of their diseases. When we reviewed the file, we found significant setbacks and deteriorations to these cases and we found 45 deaths in three months”.</p><p>The health deterioration is particularly severe in cases with tumors and liver and kidney failure. For example: “The registered patient with a tumor in a particular organ of their body has become now with a tumor spread in the whole body. And the registered patient with partial loss of kidney functions has become now with acute kidney failure.”</p><p>An arduous journey for a patient ends in death</p><p>There is no alternative for these patients to travel abroad, other than Sana’a International Airport.</p><p>Since the closure of Sana’a Airport, passengers have to first take road trips for long hours to arrive at Aden or Seiyun airports. Then, they take their flights to their destinations abroad.</p><p>Given the hardship of traveling overland to the airport in Seiyun, for instance, and the extreme stress of the patient due to the nature and length of the road that travelers take today from Sana’a to Seiyun, it is 24-hour journey by bus from Sana’a to Seiyun. Travelers from Hudaydah (far west) or Saadah (far north) may take one day and a half or two days to reach Seiyun.</p><p>It is a long road, most of which lack maintenance, and large parts of it are not asphalt. Along this road, which passes through five governorates (Sana’a, Dhamar, Al-Bayda, Marib, Hadhramaut), and interspersed with mountains, valleys, and deserts, there are approximately 30 security checkpoints from all warring sides, stopping passengers sequentially, and delaying them deliberately.</p><p>Due to this tragic situation, doctors advise many cases not to travel by land to avoid severe complications to the patient’s health, some of which may reach the point of death, during the road trip or before the flight departure.</p><p><span><a href="https://mwatana.org/en/two-options-for-patients/">https://mwatana.org/en/two-options-for-patients/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>How Iran’s Islamic Revolution Does, and Does Not, Influence Houthi Rule in Northern Yemen</strong></p><p>Some Houthi adversaries have gone as far as alleging that the Houthis have converted to Twelver Shiism, seek to remodel Yemen along Iranian Twelver lines and to become themselves a Yemeni version of Lebanon’s Hezbollah.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span></p><p>The available evidence does not bear out these accusations, but instead points to a relationship between Tehran and the Houthis that is far more nuanced. What this relationship is and what it is not, with its domestic, regional and international complexities, can be clarified somewhat by analyzing the ideological and theological underpinnings of both groups, and the power structures that currently govern Sana’a and large parts of northern Yemen. A preliminary reading of the structure of the Houthi regime and an examination of its discourse and imagery shows that the Houthis are in part indebted to the Islamic Republic of Iran for establishing a body of language, symbols of resistance and revolution, as well as an organizational structure to draw on. </p><p>The following paper examines this, as well as how the ideology of revolution, with its basis in Shia theological concepts and the realities of the regional order, underpins the connections between the Houthis and Iran. This paper does not, however, examine the extent of direct Iranian involvement in the Yemen War, which is the subject of much dispute. International reports have alleged that Iran is involved in illegally supplying the Houthis with arms, fuel and money.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span> Attempts by various media and political actors to describe the conflict, now in its fifth year, as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran usually overlook the Houthis’ other means of support in Yemen. For instance, on the financial front, the UN Panel of Experts on Yemen estimated the Houthis had access to a minimum of 407 billion Yemeni rials (US$1.62 billion at the fixed rate in 2017, the time of the research) annually from the national economy in areas they control, and that they generate revenues from taxes and customs, telecommunications, blackmail of merchants and fuel trading on the black market.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[3]</sup></a></span> Thus, while the authors acknowledge that an assessment of any direct command-and-control links between Tehran and the Houthis deserves greater research, it is beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>Tehran’s Revolutionary Doctrine and the ‘Axis of Resistance’</p><p>While “exporting the revolution” was a key doctrine of the clerical regime established in Iran after 1979,<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[6]</sup></a><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"> </a></span>the long war with Iraq and the limited appeal of an explicitly Twelver Shia ideology in the majority Sunni Middle East led to a certain amount of pragmatism in Iran’s search for regional allies and proxies. As such, Iranian support for foreign groups is not necessarily tied to direct religious affiliation, but rather rests with wider ideological principles such as anti-imperialism and opposition to Israel, the United States and its allies such as Saudi Arabia.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[7]</sup></a></span> </p><p>The Houthi Leadership’s Stance Toward Iranian Ideology</p><p>Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi did not conceal his fascination with the Iranian model, and he held Ayatollah Khomeini as a just and righteous leader whose efforts to resist Western influence in the Middle East should be imitated. He suggested that the model of the Iranian Revolution was the best example to follow, arguing: “Look at those who have managed to build a great nation. This can be applied to Iran, which has achieved a huge leap since the Islamic Revolution. Are not those (the Iranians) who secure life and produce men and build nations?”<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[25]</sup></a></span> Concerned by what he believed to be the humiliation of the Arabs by their Western enemies, most prominently the US and Israel, Al-Houthi saw in Iran the possibility of leading the Arabs toward “dignity and glory,” given its appeal as a Shia and anti-imperialist revolutionary model.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[26]</sup></a></span></p><p>Nevertheless, Al-Houthi on many occasions explicitly rejected Twelver Shiism, for example mocking the concept of the Mahdi and the doctrine of the Hidden Imam.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[27]</sup></a></span> Instead, he distinguished Zaidis as the “elite” among all Islamic sects, the “true believers,” and claimed that revolution against injustice formed the main principle of Zaidi Islam.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[28]</sup></a></span> His commitment to revolution came from “an absolute commitment to the principle [of] ‘commanding what is just and forbidding what is wrong’” in Zaidi thought,<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[29]</sup></a></span> a classical Zaidi political theory following from belief in divine justice.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[30]</sup></a></span> While Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi criticized Twelver doctrine, he justified his admiration for Iran, Khomeini and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in terms of administration and action: </p><p>Through the course of the ongoing conflict in Yemen, however, Iranian influences have increasingly been seen in the promotion of many cultural and religious activities that have no clear links to Zaidi history in Yemen. This includes the commemorations of Ashoura (the mourning of the marytrdom of Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed) and Al-Quds International Day (a yearly event declared by Khomeini to express support for the Palestinian cause and oppose Israel and Zionism).</p><p>From this basis, the discourse, imagery and structure of the Houthi regime under the leadership of Abdelmalek al-Houthi, the current leader of the movement and the brother of Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, will be addressed and compared to that of Iran. While still considered a Zaidi religious leader, Abdelmalek al-Houthi’s rhetoric since the Arab uprisings of 2011 and the takeover of Sana’a in 2014 has emphasized nationalism and the Houthi brand of social justice, downplaying the Zaidi revivalist origins of the Houthi movement.<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[34]</sup></a></span></p><p>Slogans and Imagery Reflect Shared Revolutionary Themes</p><p>Like Iran’s other allies and proxies in the region, the Houthis draw on a body of anti-imperialist, anti-Zionist and Islamist slogans and images which became popularized by Iran’s Islamic Republic. Indeed, the mindset of the Houthi insurgency owes much to “the scream” (al-sarkha): “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews, victory to Islam.”<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050#endnotes"><sup>[35]</sup></a></span> In this slogan, three pillars of the Houthi ideology with similarities to those of the Iranian revolution are apparent: anti-imperialism (through opposition to the US), anti-Zionism (through opposition to Israel) and Islamism.</p><p>As a political entity the Houthis dubbed themselves Ansar Allah (Supporters of God), similar to Lebanese Hezbollah (Party of God). An early emblem widely associated with the Houthis and used outside of Yemen by Iranian and Lebanese media, apparently without the group’s objection, shared common elements and features with those of Hezbollah and the seal of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).

Today, Saudi Arabia controls al-Mahrah’s airport and Saudi forces have assumed a role akin to a state security apparatus in the province as air reconnaissance and other operations are launched from a command center at the base, bypassing even its allies.

Here is my story.</strong></p><p>I was held in a Saudi-Coalition prison facility in Ma'rib city for more than two years with little to no outside communication.</p><p>Driving through Ma’rib and reaching the western outskirts of the city, our car was pulled over by armed gangs at a checkpoint named “Al-Falaj”. Masked gangs with kalashnikov rifles blindfolded us, beat us multiple times and took us to an undisclosed location somewhere in Ma’rib city.</p><p>We arrived to what looked like a court hall. How delighted we were, despite the circumstances. We thought we were about to go through judicial procedures as with any arrest. Unfortunately, we soon realized the court room was turned into a make-shift prison by our hostage-takers.</p><p>We also realized the masked gangs weren’t Yemeni security personnel, but rather rag-tag militias from the sectarian, extremist Islah party, led by notorious warlord Abdulghani Sha’lan.</p><p>After five days at the make-shift court prison, we were thus again blindfolded, beaten and taken to the Saleh Institutional Detention Facility – a notorious, dystopian prison located inside Ma’rib city. We were trampled on and beaten with the stocks of their kalashnikov rifles multiple times. I suffered severe bruises all over my face and body.</p><p>The Saleh Detention Facility is renowned amongst people as a torture dungeon. Throughout Saleh’s regime, the prison halls were filled up with political dissidents, academics, writers and journalists. Most of them never returned home. They were all tortured to death.</p><p>So this was my life now. I was tortured three times a week, followed by a shady interrogation process. </p><p>The masked Islah gangs only allowed us to eat very little, unhealthy food. Not enough, to say the least. We were also denied access to water or any fluids at all, and were only allowed to shave and shower once or twice a month.</p><p>Amongst the many horrendous methods of torture I witnessed and was subjected to, a few stood out to me. For my book I released a few months ago, I made a few sketches that would visualize what me and the other inmates went through.</p><p><span><a href="https://peoplesexaminer.com/i-was-a-prisoner-in-a-saudi-coalition-torture-dungeon-here-is-my-story/">https://peoplesexaminer.com/i-was-a-prisoner-in-a-saudi-coalition-torture-dungeon-here-is-my-story/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p><p><strong>Entwicklungen einer Wasserkrise zur Wasserkatastrophe gefährden Entwicklungen im Jemen</strong></p><p>Im September 2019, den Letzen aktuellen Höhepunkt des Krieges, hatten 17.8 Millionen Jemeniten (63% der Bevölkerung) eingeschränkten oder keinen sicheren Zugang zu Trinkwasser(USAID). Zudem zählt der Jemen zu den am wenigsten vorbereiteten und am stärksten betroffenen Ländern des Klimawandels. Es ist offensichtlich, dass der Jemen sich aktuell in einer Wasserkrise befindet, und sollten keine tiefgreifenden Änderungen und Unterstützungsmaßnahmen stattfinden, droht das Land langfristig in ein durch Wassermangelverschärftes Chaos zu versinken. Hauptursachen der Wasserkrise sind v.a. das Missmanagement im landwirtschaftlichen und politischen Sektor, das den Raubbau der knappen Grundwasserspeicher seit Jahren befördert und weder den Anbau wasser-intensiven und berauschenden Droge noch das Bevölkerungswachstum eindämmen. Zweitens führen die klimatischen Veränderungen zu einem Anstieg der Temperaturen, zunehmenden Schwankungen im Niederschlag und einem Anstieg des Meeresspiegels. Der Bürgerkrieg hat letztendlich diese Wasserkrise in eine hydrologische Katastrophe transformiert, indem Wasser zum militärischen Ziel aller beteiligten Parteien wurde und weitreichende hydrologische Infrastrukturen zerstört wurden.</p><p>Für eine nachhaltige Verbesserung der Wasserversorgung ist auch das Engagement internationaler Akteure gefragt. So sollte die Bundesregierung in Zusammenarbeit mitregionalen Partnern die aktuellen Annäherungsversuche zwischen Huthis und der Regierung ausschöpfen, um die zukünftige Wasserversorgung des Jemens im Rahmen der UN-Verhandlungen verstärkt zu thematisieren, Wasser als Verhandlungsinstrument zur Stärkung der Zusammenarbeit anwenden, lokale Initiativen finanziell, mit Experten und auf technischer Ebene unterstützen und regionale Partner für den Wiederaufbau der Infrastruktur zusammenbringen.</p><p>Der 2004 durch den Aufstand der Huthis ausgelöste jemenitische Bürgerkrieg, hat mitder 2015 saudisch-emiratischen angeführten Intervention einen internationalen Charakterbekommen. Durch diese Intervention sind verstärkt lokale Konfliktdynamiken und die Rolle von Wasser dabei in den Hintergrund geraten. So vermutet die staatliche Zeitung</p><p>al-Thawra, dass zwischen 70% und 80% aller ländlichen Konflikte (70% der jemenitischen Bevölkerung leben inländlichen Umständen) im Jemen um Wasser geführt werden – von Alexander Reiffenstuel</p><p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/42054952/Entwicklungen_einer_Wasserkrise_zur_Wasserkatastrophe_gefährden_Entwicklungen_im_Jemen">https://www.academia.edu/42054952/Entwicklungen_einer_Wasserkrise_zur_Wasserkatastrophe_gefährden_Entwicklungen_im_Jemen</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2><p>(* A H P)</p><p>WHO denies registering cases of coronavirus in Yemen</p><p>The World Health Organization on Sunday denied recording new cases of the Coronavirus in Yemen.</p><p>"Currently the risk of coronavirus in Yemen is low.

This forced the local authorities in this governorate, which has one of two airports, and the Saudi- coalition allows crossing through it, to Yemeni lands on almost weekly flights and as it is subject to Saudi forces or acting factions on their behalf, to calm down the city by talking about measures at Sayun airport to reduce the outbreak.</p><p>The same scene is repeated in Aden, south of Yemen where the doctors and the Emirates that rule the city through the transitional council that loyal to it prevented from using the major hospital in the city, known as the “AlSadaqah Hospital”, as a quarantine center, to transfer the affected people to the hospital.</p><p>Over the past weeks of the announcing the epidemic in countries such as China, the coalition-backed Hadi government took no action, but rather allowed nearly 100 Yemeni students who fled China to enter without examination or quarantine. Even the measures that it was took on the reality of popular pressure did not rise to the level of confronting the epidemic. This is admitted by the director of Aden International Airport, Abdul Raqeeb Al-Omari, who spoke in a television interview saying that the procedures in the airport are not enough to detain an injured person for a few hours.

since late January, the conflict has been intensifying with each passing day with close to a hundred fighters from both sides killed in just the last two weeks. This death toll included an attack on Yemeni defence minister which took the lives of his six guards, which came just a day after battle near the port of Hodeidah that killed 18. </p><p>Since the attack on Aramco’s oil facility at Abqaiq — which Houthis claimed responsibility for but the Kingdom blamed on Iran — Saudi Arabia had gone a little under the radar, toning down its aggression by a notch or two. But of late, things seem to have changed as the conflict in Yemen escalates and airstrikes resumed. </p><p>Much of Saudi Arabia’s aggression is thanks to the confidence boost Saudis received after the US increased its military presence both in the Kingdom and around the region after taking out Iranian General Qasem Solemani. And that certainly looked like the case too when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Saudi Arabia on Feb 21 and discussed the rise in conflict in Yemen with his hosts, including the king, crown prince and the deputy defense minister. </p><p><a href="https://www.insideover.com/politics/peace-on-knifes-edge-as-yemen-conflict-re-escalates.html">https://www.insideover.com/politics/peace-on-knifes-edge-as-yemen-conflict-re-escalates.html</a></p><p>(B K P)</p><p><span>Yemen’s Grim Fifth Anniversary</span></p><p>In their rabid hatred of the blessed land and people of Yemen, and in their desperate attempt to destroy the Ansarullah liberation movement and the National Salvation Government that had freed Yemen from imperialism during the September 21 Revolution of 2014-2015, the invaders have not let up on their cruelty.

It seems strange that the focus is put on Houthis and Islah Party (Muslim Brotherhood) here. It’s odd to claim that Islah should be “Iran-backed”. Islah is fighting against the Houthis which in Western and anti-Houthi news generally are labeled as “Iran-backed”. All this sounds like parroting southern separatist propaganda. And more, when “ethnic cleansing” is mentioned. Against which ethnic group of the population Houthis and Islah committed anything of this? It’s the southern separatists who hunted and ousted people just because of being northerners. – Jendoubi is a serious person (<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamel_Jendoubi">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamel_Jendoubi</a></span>), how such an interview could be possible?</p><p>(* B K P)</p><p>IOLDCs: Houthis, Islah use children in war</p><p>The Secretary-General of the United Nations has included the Houthi militia, the Government forces and Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula for the second time in the annual "list of shame" for gross violations of children during the armed conflict. However, the methods of the Islah party and Al-Qaida and the Houthis militias have evolved from indoctrinating school students, brainwashing and obliging them to be devoted by the spirit of hostility, violence, hatred and love for fighting. They have convinced them about their duty to fight against Israel and the United States of America, as the shortest route to paradise.<br /> This phenomenon began with Al-Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia, and has since become one practised by ISIS and Al-Houthi Militia. The Houthi senior leader admitted to the Associated Press that the Houthis have recruited 18,000 child soldiers to their army since 2014.<br /> Likewise, the Islah party (the Muslim Brotherhood) also practices child recruitment in Yemen, using the camps of the Yemeni government forces currently under the power of the Islah Party which dominates the decision-making in the Yemeni government.</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/18527">http://en.adenpress.news/news/18527</a></span></p><p>My remark: From a pro-separatist news site, blaming the enemies of the separatists.</p><p>(* B P)</p><p>Escalation in Failed Military Interventions: Saudi and Emirati Quagmires in Yemen</p><p>Abstract</p><p>External interventions are an enduring feature of international relationships. While the causes for interventions have been at the heart of studies on interventions, the dynamics of termination versus escalation have received little attention. This article poses the question: why do intervenors persist in failed military interventions despite diminishing prospects of victory? Whereas some scholars adhered to rational choice approaches, others focused on cognitive and emotional psychology to explain seemingly puzzling decisions at the origin of war continuation. This article builds on the emerging literature on status in IR to unravel the escalation of commitment to a failed war. It argues that when leaders engage their own status and that of their countries to an eventual success in a military intervention, persistence in the war becomes the only solution to salvage their status. Through this lens, this article presents an explanation for Saudi and Emirati escalations in what was planned as a brief operation in Yemen since 2015. Understanding the dynamics of persisting in failed wars has clear implications for the development of international relations theory, the conduct of regional powers in military interventions, and the practice of conflict resolution in the Middle East and beyond.

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are widespread in the presence of large-scale humanitarian food assistance. In 2020, it is anticipated that over 17 million people will be in need of monthly humanitarian food assistance. A risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) persists and would be possible if conflict significantly disrupts port operations – thereby limiting the country’s capacity to import food – or otherwise restricts food supply to particular areas for a prolonged period of time.</p><p>Continued depreciation and disrupted food imports are expected to increase food prices across the country.

According to UNVIM reporting, monthly food import levels through the Red Sea Ports have been declining since October 2020.

Others are helping to build houses as part of cash-for-work schemes, so they can pay for food and medicines.</p><p>Our response prioritizes gender justice: supporting women, across the region, to fight the deep patriarchal norms that would otherwise seek to diminish their voices and paralyze their actions.</p><p>The world’s worst crisis is also one in which it is endlessly and increasingly difficult to save and rebuild lives. Authorities and other groups with power — and often guns — are known to harass women aid workers, question indispensable expenses, delay the approval of visas, block roads and demand kickbacks, and paralyze the process of signing of agreements for life-saving programs.</p><p>In the space of a week in Yemen I counted more than a hundred checkpoints that I passed through. I know our teams can at times spend hours stuck in them. How can that be amid such intense suffering?</p><p>We call for funding to save lives. The United Nations are seeking a minimum of $4.2 billion — and yet still it is not met. That some rich governments are considering cutting off funding to Yemen is unacceptable, and indeed frightening from the perspective of an internally displaced person (IDP) camp in a place like Al-Malikah. People taking decisions on whether to continue their support must consider the size of the needs and the growing vulnerability.</p><p>If rich governments are to turn their backs on anything, it must not be aid, but on the arms trade — their arms trade — that continues to thrive in the region and fuel this conflict. </p><p><span><a href="https://medium.com/@Oxfam/after-five-years-of-conflict-i-saw-glimmers-of-hope-being-made-invisible-in-yemen-12c2d74548fe">https://medium.com/@Oxfam/after-five-years-of-conflict-i-saw-glimmers-of-hope-being-made-invisible-in-yemen-12c2d74548fe</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Reaching the unreachable</p><p><em>RDP is a Yemeni national non-profit and non-governmental organization aiming to mitigate the suffering of communities affected by disasters and wars and increase social responsibility to contribute effectively and positively on the development process.</em></p><p>Al-Qaweem road is located in Al-Hareeb district of Marib Governorate.

From there, they are often immediately imprisoned in ‘torture camps’ until they pay more money to a new set of smugglers. They are then taken through Yemen, which has been deemed the site of the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/02/1032811">world’s worst humanitarian catastrophe</a> according to the UN, into Saudi Arabia.</span></p><p><span>If they survive getting caught in the crossfires of the war and the Saudi border guards, who use lethal force as a first resort, Ethiopians are then subject to yet more human trafficking detention camps, before undertaking exploitative, precarious work inside Saudi Arabia, whose policy it is to hunt them down and deport them </span><em>en masse</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>On the magnitude of human suffering, it is one of the most newsworthy stories unfolding today, but it is rarely covered.</span></p><p><span>Al Bawaba spoke with Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/08/15/ethiopians-abused-gulf-migration-route">who authored a report</a> on this migration route and interviewed a dozen Ethiopian migrants on their experiences having survived through it. </span></p><p>In his talk with Al Bawaba, he pieces together the perilous journey Ethiopians are making into Yemen and Saudi Arabia every day, and breaks down why it isn’t receiving sustained attention from the media.</p><p><span>“People who have almost no assets, just very limited resources. They sell whatever they even have to get that person free so they don’t get killed. It’s just tragic. That person comes back with nothing; nothing to show for it,” Coogle adds.</span></p><p><span>"It’s an untold story of human misery that has many facets.”</span></p><p><span>In brainstorming ways to alleviate the suffering involved in the migration, Coogle thinks “The best thing would be safe migration routes to the Gulf.”</span></p><p><span>“If there were safe and legal ways for the Ethiopians to get there,” that were widely accessible, Ethiopians stand better chances surviving what has been a perilous journey, he posits.</span></p><p>Another recommendation Coogle provides is for Ethiopia to conduct a nationwide awareness campaign alerting potential emigrants to the dangers that await them in the migration route, including the possibility of getting caught in an ongoing war in Yemen – by Ty Joplin (with interview in audio)</p><p><span><a href="https://www.albawaba.com/news/understanding-mass-migration-ethiopians-yemen-adam-coogle-1341852">https://www.albawaba.com/news/understanding-mass-migration-ethiopians-yemen-adam-coogle-1341852</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Witnessing the Hell a Migrant Can Face</p><p>If you just look at the numbers, Ethiopia is doing great. But, not for people in the rural districts, where agrarian distress remains a fact of life. Of those who use the Eastern Route to migrate, <span><a href="https://www.iom.int/news/journey-africa-yemen-remains-worlds-busiest-maritime-migration-route">over 90 percent</a></span> come from Ethiopia, and most of them from the rural districts of Amhara, Oromia, and Tigray. The World Food Program and the Ethiopian government’s <span><a href="https://tinyurl.com/vxl8aqe">data</a></span> shows us that these districts face terrible food insecurity and that there is a high level of food energy deficiency per adult in rural Ethiopia, with Amhara and Tigray leading the way. There has been barely any exit from the long-term crisis of agriculture in Ethiopia, whose lands are now increasingly threatened by corporations from India and Saudi Arabia and by shifts in the climate.</p><p>Neoliberal policies have enabled Ethiopia to grow quickly, but this growth has not been pro-people, certainly not the people of the rural districts of Amhara, Oromia, and Tigray, from where the main migration has been taking place.</p><p>Djibouti</p><p>Djibouti, at the tip of the Horn of Africa, within sight of Yemen, is one of the smallest countries in the world. But it is located at a strategic vantage, at the entrance of the Red Sea. </p><p>Despite the presence of these forces in such a small country, there is no effective way to prevent the migration of thousands of Ethiopians through Djibouti to Yemen. Neither the ports nor the waters are barriers to this human exodus.</p><p>Yemen</p><p>It is into this cauldron that the Ethiopian migrants come. Crossing the Red Sea is not easy, since the boats are insufficient and overcrowded; migrants who make it to Yemen <span><a href="https://www.iom.int/news/journey-africa-yemen-remains-worlds-busiest-maritime-migration-route">report</a></span> that they have seen people leap off the boats to certain death because of the terrible situation that they face. In March 2017, a UAE-Saudi helicopter <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/17/somali-refugees-killed-helicopter-attack-off-yemen-coast">fired</a></span> at a boat carrying Somali migrants—killing at least 42 people; there are additional reports of this kind of activity along the Yemeni shoreline.</p><p>In Yemen, the migrants are held in detention camps, where they are <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/17/yemen-detained-african-migrants-tortured-raped">abused</a></span> by human traffickers and by other gangsters. Migrants in these camps, including in Aden, face extortion—if they cannot pay the guards, they are beaten, raped, and held indefinitely. When the spotlight is shone on any one of these camps, it closes and another opens elsewhere.</p><p>Saudi Arabia</p><p>If the migrants somehow make it to Saudi Arabia, the terror <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/08/15/ethiopians-abused-gulf-migration-route">continues</a></span>. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/02/28/witnessing-the-hell-a-migrant-can-face/">https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/02/28/witnessing-the-hell-a-migrant-can-face/</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.eurasiareview.com/29022020-witnessing-the-hell-a-migrant-can-face-oped/">https://www.eurasiareview.com/29022020-witnessing-the-hell-a-migrant-can-face-oped/</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Yemen: UNHCR Operational Update, 27 February 2020</p><p><span>The first distribution of cash assistance for IDP families has begun in northern Yemen to address basic needs such as rent and protection services.
