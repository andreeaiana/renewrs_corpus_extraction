It may be even bigger than many of us realize.</p><p>While forces within U.S. political circles, Israel and Saudi Arabia keep trying to shift the blame to Iran, the most likely scenario is that the Houthis in North Yemen were responsible for the attack as a follow up to last month’s hit <a href="https://tomluongo.me/2019/08/18/saudis-iran-houthi-yemen/">which showed off the capabilities of their new drones</a>.</p><p>That attack set the stage for the latest one in a classic case of the past being prologue. By showing the world it was capable of throwing drones anywhere in Saudi Arabia rebels in Yemen created plausibility for last weekend’s attack.</p><p>And as I said the other day <a href="https://tomluongo.me/2019/09/17/questions-not-answers-surround-u-s-push-to-war-with-iran/">this attack begs a lot of questions</a>. And the ham-fisted push to blame Iran for it, after President Trump all but ruled out a military response from the U.S. from all corners of the U.S. and Saudi establishment opens up even more.</p><p>If this was a swarm attack from Iraq and Iran, as claimed now (<a href="https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/09/article/how-iran-precisely-targeted-saudi-oil-facilities/">and supported by factless conjecture</a>) then how did all the vaunted U.S. technology fail to account for it?</p><p>U.S. Naval CENTCOM is in Bahrain folks. Are these people blind as well as incompetent?</p><p>No. I don’t think they are. Say what you want about U.S. political leadership and the nigh-treasonous bureaucracy supporting it, I don’t think our military is that fundamentally corrupt, lazy or stupid.</p><p>What are we spending all of the money on, after all?</p><p>By continuing to spin this attack up as Iranian in origin people like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Saudi Arabian government are throwing the Pentagon under the bus.</p><p>The truth is that by trying to re-frame this as an attack by Iraqi Shi’ite militias, the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), in conjunction with the IRGC, we are trying to further separate them from the Iraqi government who still openly support them and deflect against Saudi Arabia’s inherent weakness.</p><p>The PMUs have been our target politically in Iraq for months now so as to restart the chaos in Iraq.</p><p>Think back to the drone incident in June which nearly landed us in a war with Iran. The story morphed and changed with each day. The Iranians had the data, the proof, on their side and they let morons like Pompeo say provably false things before releasing it.</p><p>“Drip Drip Drip” is the strategy, as Andrew Breitbart used to call it. Drip out some information and allow your target to lie about it. Then drip out the next bit exposing that lie. And so on, and so on.</p><p>That’s what Iran did in June, humiliating Trump at every turn. And I’m sure if they weren’t behind this attack they will do the same thing in the coming days.</p><p>And I also think the U.S knows this as well. And that’s why nothing much more will come of it. It will be used diplomatically to tie Trump’s hands and front a lie to conceal more important truths.</p><p>And this brings me to the stark possibility <span><a href="http://thesaker.is/how-the-houthis-overturned-the-chessboard/">Pepe Escobar laid out in his recent column</a></span>. The Houthis may, right now, be in a position to launch an all-out attack from Yemen on Saudi Arabia and destabilize the country.</p><p>An uprising in the east has always been on the table. It’s why the Saudis need $80+ per barrel oil. They have to pay for social programs that keep the population relatively happy.</p><p>From every side now, the Saudi Kingdom is under existential threat. So, I’m not surprised they are trying to push the blame for this incident onto Iran.</p><p>The quick announcement by newly-minted Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman that Aramco’s production will be back to normal quickly was done to reassure potential investors in the upcoming Aramco IPO, a $400 billion affair. It is the lynchpin to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s (MbS) Vision 2030 plan for modernizing the kingdom’s economy.</p><p>That fits with the desire to deflect the source of the attack away from their war in Yemen. Because, as bad as the optics are for the U.S. military, they are far worse for the Saudis if the Houthis are truly the culprits.</p><p>At a minimum the changing of the energy minister was a signal that a shift in Saudi policy is forthcoming. But without suing for peace soon MbS may not have time he thought he did.</p><p>Because there is no appetite for all out war with Iran in the U.S. The Saudis are no longer the ‘good Arabs’ to most Americans.</p><p>The military doesn’t want to put the soldiers at risk, Wall St. doesn’t want to see a financial collapse that makes Lehman Bros. look like a couple of Amish kids on rumspringa.</p><p>War with Iran will not be conventional. It will come from all sides, all across the Shia Crescent, but especially Yemen. Of this the Iranians have been very clear, regardless of the outcome. They believe their missile technology is superior to U.S. air defense systems</p><p>So, MbS better come to the conclusion quick that a settlement in Yemen is the key to his near-term survival.</p><p>And while an all-out war would certainly bring $150+ per barrel oil which the Saudis need to balance their budget, they most likely wouldn’t be the ones selling into that market – by Tom Luongo</p><p><span><a href="https://tomluongo.me/2019/09/19/will-the-yemen-war-be-the-end-of-saudi-arabia/">https://tomluongo.me/2019/09/19/will-the-yemen-war-be-the-end-of-saudi-arabia/</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/luongo-will-yemen-war-be-end-saudi-arabia">https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/luongo-will-yemen-war-be-end-saudi-arabia</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/2019/09/thomas-luongo/will-the-yemen-war-be-the-end-of-saudi-arabia/">https://www.lewrockwell.com/2019/09/thomas-luongo/will-the-yemen-war-be-the-end-of-saudi-arabia/</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/will-yemen-war-end-saudi-arabia/5689754">https://www.globalresearch.ca/will-yemen-war-end-saudi-arabia/5689754</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Who are south Yemen's separatists?</strong></p><p>The Southern Transitional Council, backed by United Arab Emirates, is leading the separatist cause in Aden.</p><p>The separatist fighters in Aden are loyal to the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a political body established in Aden in 2017 that wants to restore independence in the south.</p><p>The capture of Aden by secessionists has shifted the centre of the <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/yemen.html">Yemen war</a></span> to the south and brought renewed focus to the country's decades-old southern question.</p><p><span>"The STC wants to have authority over the territories they operate in," said Sama'a al-Hamdani, an independent Yemen analyst and non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute.</span></p><p><span>"This could potentially mean sharing power with the government temporarily before asking for a referendum on secession," she continued.</span></p><p><span>"They also want to be recognised internationally for their role in supporting the coalition and the Yemeni government throughout the war."</span></p><p>The STC was behaving akin to what Topham called a "government-in-waiting in the south with state-like characteristics and a would-be parliament, the National Assembly".</p><p>UAE role in south Yemen</p><p>Since 2016, the <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-arab-emirates.html">United Arab Emirates</a></span> has provided military and financial backing to the Security Belt, a now STC-dominated paramilitary group comprised of some 90,000 Yemeni fighters.</p><p>In 2015, the coalition relied on the Security Belt to secure territories in the south and reinstate the government in Aden, with Hadi's forces regaining full control of the city in July.</p><p>Human Rights Watch in 2017 <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/22/yemen-uae-backs-abusive-local-forces">alleged</a></span> the militia had carried out abuses, including arbitrarily detaining people and forcibly disappearing dozens.</p><p>"The STC was considered part of the [Saudi-UAE-led] coalition and a key partner to Hadi's government," al-Hamdani said.</p><p>Yet the fighting between the UAE-backed Security Belt and government forces supported by Saudi Arabia has exposed divisions between the coalition's two key leaders.</p><p><span>To curry favour with the international community, Topham said the STC has been "claiming continued support for the Hadi government in public statements, while simultaneously embarking on an international lobbying offensive for its separatist cause". </span></p><p><span>But there are fears the UAE is using the southern separatist sentiment for its own geopolitical interests, especially given the fact the south is rich in natural resources.</span></p><p><span>"The UAE has economic priority in south Yemen," Afrah Nasser, an independent Yemeni journalist and analyst, told Al Jazeera. "Their aspirations in the south has to do with their investment interests."</span></p><p>Cracks in a unified Yemen</p><p>While secessionist sentiment in the south has been fuelled by recent political developments, it is rooted in its past. </p><p>Southern Movement</p><p>In 2007, the ongoing political and economic marginalisation in the south led to the formation of the Southern Movement, or al-Hirak al-Janoubi. </p><p>Until 2011, the movement staged regular protests calling for the return of the South Yemen republic that attracted crowds of thousands.</p><p>The government response to these rallies was brutal. </p><p>What next?</p><p>Outside of Aden, smaller separatist movements in other southern provinces do not back the STC's vision of re-establishing the South Yemen republic through the use of force, with the STC unlikely to easily traverse the fragmentation of allegiances within the south.</p><p>"All of the United Nations Security Council handling of the Yemen conflict has consistently affirmed the Hadi government's legitimacy and Yemen's territorial integrity as its legal basis," Topham said. </p><p>Furthermore, the STC is "not the only group to claim the mantle of the southern independence cause", she added, referring to other rival separatist groups with ambitions of representation.</p><p>According to Nasser, about 25 other separatist groups exist in the south.</p><p>"They are all for independence but have different visions on how to achieve that so in that sense are much more polarised," she said – by Linah Alsaafin</p><p><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/south-yemen-separatists-190919074008631.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/south-yemen-separatists-190919074008631.html</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2><p>(* B H)</p><p>Epidemics of infectious diseases have been spreading fast as a result of the lack of healthcare in Lahj governorate.

Diese sind nach einem Bericht einer UN-Expertenkommission identisch mit Drohnen, die auch im Iran produziert werden. Dieser Drohnen-Typ hat eine Spannweite von rund drei Metern und kann mit einem 30 bis 45 Kilogramm schweren Sprengsatz bestückt werden. Die Reichweite beträgt rund 150 Kilometer. Im Juli dieses Jahres stellten die Huthis neue Drohnentypen der Öffentlichkeit vor.

Two we’d like to address are whether they change the current classification of the conflict in Yemen, and second, whether oil facilities are targetable under IHL?</p><p>The actors involved in the attacks and the classification of the conflict</p><p>IHL operates on the basis of a dichotomy of international and non-international armed conflicts (IACs and NIACs), where classification depends on the nature of the belligerent parties involved. Despite the <span><a href="https://www.geneva-academy.ch/joomlatools-files/docman-files/The%20War%20Report%202018.pdf#page=18">multiplicity of actors</a></span> involved in the conflict in Yemen, all of the ongoing conflicts remain non-international in their nature as <span><a href="http://www.rulac.org/browse/conflicts/non-international-armed-conflicts-in-yemen#collapse2accord">none of them occur</a></span> between two or more States, but only between States and organized groups and between such groups.

In other words, provided that the attacks in Saudi Arabia were indeed conducted by the Houthis, they would be covered by the rules of the <span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/GEE-Yemen/A_HRC_42_CRP_1.PDF#page=13">pre-existing non-international armed</a></span> conflict between the group and Yemen, with Saudi Arabia being a ‘co-belligerent’ State in the conflict.</p><p>The legal framework governing the attacks would, however, change if the attacks were conducted by Iran. <span><a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Comment.xsp?action=openDocument&amp;documentId=BE2D518CF5DE54EAC1257F7D0036B518#_Toc452041596">Under IHL</a></span>, any “resort to armed force between States” would trigger an international armed conflict, even if such use of force is limited to minor skirmishes.</p><p>The legality of the attacks against oil facilities</p><p>The second question raised by the attacks is whether they have been conducted against a legitimate military target or whether they amount to an attack against civilian objects, an act <span><a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule7">prohibited</a></span> by IHL.</p><p>The requirements outlined in Article 52(2) API need to be met <span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/28064/targeting-tankers-law-war-part-1/">cumulatively</a></span>, i.e. the object must both make an “effective contribution to military action” and the attack on it must offer “a definite military advantage” to the party that carries it out.</p><p>With regard to the first requirement, it is questionable whether oil facilities can provide an “effective contribution to military action.” The core of the debate is whether economic assets, including oil facilities, can constitute, by their very nature, legitimate military objectives in as they may eventually result in the purchase of arms and may ultimately enable the adversary to continue fighting. Some have argued that oil installations are an example of what would normally constitute a military objective, provided that they make an effective contribution.</p><p>Most notably, the United States. <span><a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/255493.htm">interprets</a></span> the requirement of “military action” as including “war-sustaining” capabilities, and has previously targeted ISIS-controlled oil infrastructure <span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/15890/sustaining-war-effort-targeting-islamic-state-oil-facilities/">on that basis</a></span> This approach has been <span><a href="http://iihl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-conduct-of-hostilities_2007.pdf#page=80">criticized</a></span> for being too expansive and has not been <span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/28064/targeting-tankers-law-war-part-1/">accepted</a></span> to be a valid interpretation of article 52(2) API. </p><p>Further, Article 52(2) API requires attacks to provide a “definite” military advantage. This requirement prohibits belligerents from carrying out attacks that would make them gain a mere hypothetical or speculative advantage.</p><p>Another issue arising from these kinds of attacks relates to the environmental damage that can occur in the aftermath of an attack against such facilities</p><p>It therefore appears that regardless of who the actors are behind the attacks (whether Iran itself or the Houthi rebels) and the classification of the conflict in Yemen, the attacks cannot be justified under IHL on a number of grounds. Paradoxically, it is the United States that is voicing the loudest criticism and concern about these attacks while being the State that has advanced the legal interpretation that allows the targeting of objects like oil facilities – by Ilya Sobol and Margherita Stevoli</p><p><span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/66229/saudi-oil-attacks-raise-questions-about-nature-of-yemen-conflict-and-legitimate-military-targets/">https://www.justsecurity.org/66229/saudi-oil-attacks-raise-questions-about-nature-of-yemen-conflict-and-legitimate-military-targets/</a></span></p><p><span>My comment: I disagree with some main points. The idea that the Yemen War would be a "non-international" conflict because it should not be "between two or more States, but only between States and organized groups" is mereley arbitrary, as it just is based on the fact that the Houthi government is not internationally recognized. But, actually in fact this Houthi government now for several years is ruling the main part of an internationally recognized state, the Republic of Yemen. Why the international recognition should mean anything here? The fact that the Houthis actally ARE the government of Yemen controlling 70 % of Yemen's population points to a real difference to actually non-state actors and movements like the Taliban. Even, the IS when having created and actually governed its self-created "Islamic State" could not be compared to Houthis' Yemen: This "Islamic State" by itself never had been internationally recognized, there just were "Syria" and "Iraq". - Imagine, in WWII the US, Britain, the Soviet Union, France and China would have declared they no more would recognize the German Nazi government - acoording to Sobol's and Stevoli's logic, this would have changed WWII into a "non-international conflict". This would be highly absurd. </span></p><p><span>All conclusions drawn from the absurd assumption the Yemen War would be a "non-international conflict" are void.</span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia up in Flames: Riyadh Is Headed for a Major Disaster</strong></p><p>The move is part of a retaliatory campaign by the Houthis in response to the indiscriminate bombings conducted by the Saudi air force over more than four years. </p><p><span>The Saudi kingdom finds itself in an increasingly dangerous situation as a result of the retaliatory capacity of the Houthis, able to inflict severe military and economic damage on Riyadh with their missile forces. Estimates suggest that Riyadh is losing something in the region of $300 million a day from the Houthi attacks.</span></p><p><span>The withdrawal of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates from the conflict in Yemen, driven by their desire to improve relations with Tehran, and the impossibility of the United States intervening directly in the conflict, has created significant problems for the House of Saud.</span></p><p>Saturday’s retaliation is the real demonstration of what could happen to the Saudi economy if Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) refuses to sit down and negotiate a way out of one of the worst military disasters of the contemporary era.</p><p><span>The Houthis have in recent months managed to strike their targets in Saudi Arabia dozens of times using different aerial means. This highlights once again the total failure of American air-defense systems in the country.</span></p><p>Pompeo blames Tehran for the Yemeni attack on Saudi Arabia, of course without offering any proof. Riyadh and Tel Aviv are increasingly isolated in the Middle East. Washington is only able to offer tweets and paranoia about Iran to help its allies, given that a direct intervention is seen as being too risky for the global economy, not to mention the possibility of the conflict becoming a wider regional conflagration that would sink any chance of reelection in 2020 for the present administration.</p><p><span>The Yemeni response is part of an increasing asymmetric logic, which has as its primary objectives the halt to Riyadh’s bombings of Yemen by increasing the costs of doing so such that they become unsustainable</span></p><p><span>There is no need for a false flag to blame Iran for the work of the Houthis.

There are reasons to doubt that such a scenario will actually transpire, but the arguments thereof will be explained after elaborating on the hypocrisy of the “act of war” pronouncement.</p><p>It was the Saudis, not the Ansarullah, that initiated the international dimension of the War on Yemen out of their serious concern that this rebel group’s rapid successes in the neighboring country would eventually lead to their Iranian rival making military inroads on their doorstep </p><p>Seeing as how no evidence has emerged in the past 4,5 years to corroborate the Saudis’ suspicions about Iran’s future plans to tilt the regional balance of power against it in the event that the Ansarullah were to have taken full control of Yemen, it can be said that their formal intervention was predicated on the concept of “preemptive war” to offset that seemingly impending scenario that they convinced themselves (whether rightly or wrongly) was on the brink of unfolding had they not actively thwarted it. Critics allege that perspective is nothing more than the paranoid delusions of a crumbling Kingdom, but it should be pointed out that Iran has never made a secret of exporting its Islamic Revolution</p><p>Irrespective of whether there really was a secret Iranian hand behind the Aramco attack or not, few doubt that the country has the drone and missile capabilities to turn that incident into child’s play and carry out something far more devastating if it were ever attacked.</p><p>With this in mind, a US-Saudi strike on Iran would be an actual “act of war” against both their target itself and the rest of the world. – By Andrew Korybko</p><p><span><a href="http://oneworld.press/?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;id=1071">http://oneworld.press/?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;id=1071</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/ansarullah-aramco-drone-strike-real-act-war/5689658">https://www.globalresearch.ca/ansarullah-aramco-drone-strike-real-act-war/5689658</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H K P)</span></p><p>Joint NGO Statement on Yemen – 74th UN General Assembly</p><p>Humanitarian Crisis in Free Fall</p><p>After almost five years of conflict, and despite all efforts to halt displacement, hunger and disease, Yemen remains the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The suffering inflicted on Yemeni people is entirely manmade and will continue to deteriorate rapidly on all fronts without urgent action to end the violence, and to address humanitarian needs. Unfortunately, despite the Stockholm agreement, the situation for ordinary Yemenis has altered little since last year, with growing numbers of humanitarian need [1], and escalating violence all highlighting the deteriorating situation.</p><p>Increased fighting risks pushing the country into utter devastation: Conflict continues on many fronts particularly in Al Dhale, Taizz, Hodeidah, Hajjah, and Aden. Increased conflict and political stalemate in Hodeidah, as well as the recent flare in fighting and escalation of conflict in Aden, both of which are major port cities, jeopardises the safety of civilians and threatens channels for critical fuel, food and medical supplies to the rest of the country. It is crucial that these remain open and fully functional. Millions of Yemeni women, men and children are dependent on these lifelines for their survival.</p><p>Civilians continue to bear the brunt: Civilians and civilian infrastructure including hospitals, schools, water facilities, food transport, farms and market places, continue to be hit by all parties with impunity, along with the potential use of starvation as a tactic of war continuing to exacerbate an already dire humanitarian situation as reported by the UN Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen, as well as in the UN Secretary General’s Annual Report on the Situation of Children and Armed Conflict.</p><p>A lost generation of Yemeni children: The two million children and young people who remain out of school are being deprived of an education, exposing them to violence and exploitation. Millions of displaced children cannot access education, and ongoing attacks on schools or their use and occupation by armed groups mean children’s safety at school cannot be guaranteed. In 2018 alone, there were 44 verified attacks on schools and 32 instances of military uses of schools [2], highlighting the extent of the issue.</p><p>Populations on the brink of starvation: </p><p>Only a political solution can bring the war to an end and reinstate peace in Yemen and support lasting solutions to the dire humanitarian situation. All parties must immediately cease hostilities, agree to a nationwide ceasefire, and cooperate in ‘good faith’ with UN Special Envoy Martin Griffith, and help restart a broader peace process.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.savethechildren.net/news/joint-ngo-statement-yemen-%E2%80%93-74th-un-general-assembly">https://www.savethechildren.net/news/joint-ngo-statement-yemen-%E2%80%93-74th-un-general-assembly</a></span> = <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/joint-ngo-statement-yemen-74th-un-general-assembly">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/joint-ngo-statement-yemen-74th-un-general-assembly</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Another War Looming in Yemen</p><p>Fight against the Houthis have almost stalled but another conflict i.e. between Hadi government and Southern separatists is gaining momentum.

If past tense situations were any indication of a behavioural pattern, there is enough reason to believe that this time, too, the developments, however grave they are, will not lead to a war against Iran.</p><p>It should also be recalled that during the US’ standoff with Iran over the Islamic republic’s nuclear power programme, Saudi Arabia and Israel kept prodding the US to launch an attack on Iran. But the US did not attack Iran. President George W Bush and even President Barack Obama would only say that all options were on the table.</p><p>In 2001, Iran, together with Iraq and North Korea, was one of the three countries of President Bush’s Axis of Evil. Iraq was attacked and invaded, but not Iran. <br /> This is because, in US assessments, Iran is not like Iraq. Iran has the ability to hit the US and its regional allies where it hurts, although it is only an average military power when compared to the US or even Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Meanwhile, some analysts believe that Iran is being blamed because the US defence shield the Saudis have bought and installed had failed to detect and destroy the Houthi drones and missiles. So the arms suppliers to save their skin now say the missile came from the eastern direction indicating Iran or Iranian backed groups in Iraq -- and not from Yemen in the south.<br /> However, Yemen’s Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, which if taken positively sends a powerful peace message that it is time to start talks on ending the war. <br /> The international community needs to step in to make peace, instead of being a spectator in a bloody war that kills daily scores of children in Yemen</p><p>But the world community’s indifference is appalling, even after the United Nations has described the situation in Yemen as the worst humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. </p><p>Saudi Arabia, it is learnt, has requested the Trump administration to facilitate talks with the Houthis.

Since 2015, rivals continue disagree about whether Yemen should be a unified state, a partitioned one, or a federal government. The anti-Houthi front was formed despite these existing schisms. However, these contradictions and divergences can no longer be sustainable. After four years of fighting, the deep fragmentation within Yemen’s formal military and the Saudi-led coalition has now reached a breaking point. </p><p>Geographical and ideological differences deepen the military conflict. Due to the 1990 north-driven unification and the south’s defeat in the 1994 civil war, northern officers and soldiers have since dominated the army’s composition. The southerners were thus largely kept out from the unified military. Yemen’s army soldiers have a tribal background and, in many cases, belong to the Hashid tribal confederation, of whom Saleh and the Al Ahmar family are part. They also share ties with the Yemeni Congregation for Reform (Islah), the party affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and the tribal-conservative milieu. Capitalizing on his web of Islamist tribal-military loyalties in Mareb and al-Jawf, General Ali Mohsin Al Ahmar became vice president and deputy supreme commander of the armed forces for President Abd Rabu Mansur Hadi. Since President Hadi was formerly Saleh’s vice president, southerners mostly perceive him as a defender of northern interests, although he comes from the southern region of Abyan. </p><p>Moreover, a hate legacy since the 1986 intra-southern civil war is still alive and affects current military balances. </p><p>Aden’s clashes are yet another crisis that has faced Yemen’s military since the 2011 uprising. The factionalism and shifting alliances that have defined Yemeni politics have spread to its army. In 2011, the anti-government protests broke the army into two rival factions. One faction was in support of the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who resigned in late 2011. The other faction— led by General Ali Mohsin Al Ahmar and the prominent Al Ahmar family (not related to General Ali Mohsin)—was against him. In 2014 and 2015, the Houthi insurgency exacerbated these cleavages.</p><p>The military’s growing fragmentation weakens the anti-Houthi front, thus increasing risks for Saudi national security. </p><p>De-escalation and reconciliation efforts in the south should take into consideration the post-2011 security picture and its impact on the military—after all, factionalism and alliances of convenience produced Yemen’s current southern escalation.

This is especially challenging for farmers who depend on water for a good harvest. Through support from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), in partnership with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), access to water has been improved for Yemeni farmers living across nearly 4,000 acres of agricultural land in the coastal governorate of Lahj.</p><p>In the area of Al Faradha, improved access to water for 2,000 farmers, as reported by the local community, has also meant an end to a 37-year-old local conflict.</p><p>Through funding from the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund, IOM partnered with FAO to support the community in Al Faradha solve their long running water access issues. The UN organizations worked with the local Water User Association to kick start the process. The three partners met the parties involved in the local conflict to understand their issues and work together on possible solutions.</p><p>IOM and FAO implemented this UN Peace Building Fund project in both Sana’a and Lahj governorates. As a result of the project, thousands of farmers have improved access to water through rehabilitated irrigation channels in seven sites throughout Lahj governorate’s Turban Valley, with around 400 people from local communities employed during the construction work.</p><p>The irrigation channel rehabilitations have not only assisted farmers in rebuilding their livelihoods and given vulnerable households an income but helped communities end age-old local conflicts.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.iom.int/news/decades-old-conflict-over-water-yemeni-village-comes-end">https://www.iom.int/news/decades-old-conflict-over-water-yemeni-village-comes-end</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Record 12.4 million people reached with food aid in Yemen: U.N.</p><p>A record 12.4 million people in Yemen received food aid in August, the first time the targeted population was reached fully, the U.N.

He describes relations between the two as “very pragmatic.”<br /> “Iran sees a nonstate actor which it can support -- this helps it gain influence in Yemen and pressure Saudi Arabia,” Juneau says.<br /> “The Huthis are equally pragmatic: faced with a military onslaught by the far more advanced Saudi military, no other external actor would have been willing to support them so much,” he adds.<br /> Farea al-Muslimi, the chairman and co-founder of the Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies and associate fellow at the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, wrote in 2017 that the war in Yemen made the relationship between Iran and the Huthis “more essential.”<br /> “To Iran, the Huthis have not, in fact, been much of strategic allies, but they could rather be perceived as the least costly, yet the closest, middle finger that could be raised against Saudi Arabia from its own backyard.”</p><p><span>“It is clear that this [Iranian] support has steadily increased over the years, but its level should not be exaggerated, as many Iran hawks in the U.S. and elsewhere do,” Juneau says – by Golnaz Esfandiari</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/proxy-huthi-iran-saudi/30173612.html">https://www.rferl.org/a/proxy-huthi-iran-saudi/30173612.html</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Yemen to emphasize international diplomatic representation</p><p>Ministerial meeting affirms need to increase diplomatic outreach of Republic of Yemen</p><p><span><a href="https://www.uprising.today/yemen-to-emphasize-international-diplomatic-representation/">https://www.uprising.today/yemen-to-emphasize-international-diplomatic-representation/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p><span>Houthis killed 43 civilians in one week</span></p><p>The Houthis rebels have killed 43 civilians among them six women and twelve children in areas under their control in north Yemen, a local human rights organization said on new report released on Wednesday.</p><p>The Yemeni Network for Rights and Liberties documented human rights abuses carried out by the Houthis against the civilians from 6 September to 13 September 2019. </p><p>Total human rights violations that were verified reached over 1,000 abuses, according to the Yemeni Network for Rights and Liberties.</p><p>Seven civilians out of the total 43 murder cases, were killed in a weapon store explosion in a residential area of Hodeida, the report noted.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-33225">https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-33225</a></span></p><p>My remark: By an anti-Houthi news site, mixing up victims of military actions and of tyrannic rule.</p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp6 Südjemen, Separatisten und Hadi-Regierung / Southern Yemen, separatists and Hadi-government</span></h2><p><span>Siehe / Look at cp1</span></p><p><span>(* A K P)</span></p><p>Militia fighters from the Sabeha tribes clashed with forces aligned with the Transitional Political Council for the South (STC), a southern Yemeni secessionist group, in Lahij governorate in southern Yemen on September 19.

This is the third article in the series.</em>]</p><p>Why should this matter for U.S. lawmakers? Because, simply put, along with allies including the United Kingdom (UK), and France, the United States arms, trains, refuels (until 2018 at least) and shares intelligence with Coalition forces. Just this spring, President Trump, citing new military tensions with Iran, used an “emergency” loophole in U.S. arms control law to bypass Congress to complete the sale of more than eight billion dollars in weapons to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan. The move circumvented U.S. law that gives Congress power to review weapons sales.</p><p>By knowingly supplying the means by which the Saudi and Emirati-led Coalition repeatedly violates international human rights and international humanitarian law – including the crucial rules of proportionality, distinction, and precautions in attack – the U.S. shares responsibility for these violations.</p><p>The report of the Group of Eminent Experts has been clear about exactly this issue in its conclusions based on the investigation of emblematic airstrikes carried out by the Saudi and Emirati-led coalition: such repeated patterns raise “a serious doubt about whether the targeting process adopted by the coalition complied with these fundamental principles of international humanitarian law.”</p><p>Most importantly for the U.S. context, the report raises questions of responsibility related to third states, including the United States (others include the UK, France, and Iran), who directly or indirectly support parties to the conflict through the provision of arms. Specifically, the Group concludes that all arms transfers to members of the Saudi and Emirati-led Coalition, even by States that are not party to the Arms Trade Treaty, may not only trigger State responsibility in the sense that they may violate the obligation of States to cooperate to bring to an end any serious breach of international law, but also could amount to knowingly aiding or assisting members of the Saudi and Emirati-led Coalition in the commission of internationally wrongful acts.</p><p>Following the Group of Experts’ reporting, the U.S. government cannot bury its head in the sand and pretend that it does not know of the risks associated with arms transfers to parties to this conflict. Despite copious evidence of coalition air strikes that have violated international humanitarian law by indiscriminately or disproportionately killing and injuring Yemeni civilians and the conclusions about responsibility of arms supplying states by the Group of Experts, the United States continues to supply arms to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p><p>But something is changing in Washington, DC.</p><p>Stopping arms sales will help end this madness, and the time to act is now – by Rasha Mohamed and Philippe Nassif</p><p><span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/66237/yemen-group-of-experts-report-highlights-need-to-halt-arms-sales/">https://www.justsecurity.org/66237/yemen-group-of-experts-report-highlights-need-to-halt-arms-sales/</a></span></p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p><span>Raytheon: </span>Security from 22,000 miles above Earth</p><p>Raytheon developing payload for a more resilient missile warning system</p><p>Advanced missile technology in the wrong hands threatens global security.

LOL, LOL, LOL.</p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>The Iran War: Danger Lurks In Inaction</p><p>Last weekend’s drone raid on the Saudi oil fields, along with the Israeli elections, opens a new chapter in Middle Eastern relations. Whether the attack on Saudi oil production, which has temporarily stopped more than half of it, was launched by Iranian-sponsored Yemeni Houthis or by the Iranians themselves is beside the point, as the Houthis had no independent ability whatever to acquire and use such weapons.</p><p>The Iranians are behind the incident. There is room for legitimate debate about the merits of the conflicting sides in the Yemen war, but there can be no doubt that by any standards, the direct attack on Saudi Arabia was an act of war, and as it was entirely dependent on Iranian weapons procurement and instruction, it is an escalation of the war-by-proxy between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Yemen with an outright act of war by Iran against Saudi Arabia.</p><p>There is no reason to believe, or even to recommend, that Saudi Arabia should turn the other cheek and engage in reactive pacifism. Because the Trump administration has ignored the efforts of American political factions, including recalcitrant Republicans, to ditch the Saudis, Washington retains great influence on the Saudi response to what is a severe provocation. This can be seen as a great opportunity, as it furnishes a justification for administering a heavy blow against the most troublesome regime in the world.</p><p>An air assault on Iranian oil facilities and nuclear military sites would be entirely justified, and this measure should be prepared as the next step, with the prior approval of a reasonable range of supportive countries, as the instant response to any further provocations – by Conrad Black</p><p><span><a href="https://www.nysun.com/foreign/war-in-the-gulf-danger-lurks-in-inaction/90838/">https://www.nysun.com/foreign/war-in-the-gulf-danger-lurks-in-inaction/90838/</a></span></p><p>My comment: Might-be the most warmongering article I had seen so far.
