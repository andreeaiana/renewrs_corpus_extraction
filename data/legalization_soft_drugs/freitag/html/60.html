Center Editorial</strong></p><p>History will likely record the Riyadh Agreement as a game-changing moment in the ongoing Yemeni conflict – how exactly the game will change is still far from certain. What the agreement signed on November 5 in the Saudi capital may mean is that for the first time since the war began the disparate forces that make up the anti-Houthi coalition could come under a unified command and control, and that there may be one fewer state-within-a-state in Yemen to contend with. </p><p>While Yemen’s internationally recognized government and the secessionist Southern Transitional Council (STC) had been at odds since the latter’s inception in 2017, more recently there has also been searing tension between the two primary backers of these Yemeni parties, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, respectively. The Riyadh Agreement seeks to put these differences to rest</p><p>In reshaping the Yemeni cabinet and making it explicitly beholden to Saudi Arabia, the Riyadh Agreement could mean that President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi’s decisions will no longer be dictated by his sons or his political ally, Yemen’s Islah Party. Instead, Hadi and the STC have accepted that all major government actions be subordinated to Saudi Arabia. The STC, in an abrupt turn, also has accepted to be under an arrangement that explicitly endorses a unified Yemeni state, in so doing opening the door for its representatives to be present at any future United Nations-led peace talks to end the wider war. By staging a coup against the Yemeni government in Aden this past August, the STC has thus earned its place in the cabinet and international recognition, in another normalization of violence as a means to political ends.</p><p>From a purely conflict resolution perspective, having more of the main belligerents represented at the table is good news.</p><p>With the anti-Houthi side thus seemingly unifying under Saudi patronage, for better or worse, Riyadh now owns what happens, and what doesn’t happen, in southern Yemen. While unwritten in the actual text, it would appear the new hierarchy the agreement envisions will specifically be headed by Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, who has quietly assumed responsibility for the Yemen file from his brother, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince and defense minister.</p><p> Khalid bin Salman’s vested interest in the agreement’s success and the back-channel conversations between him and the Houthis which began in September, as reported by the Sana’a Center, could foster the necessary matrix for a broader peace process in Yemen among all sides. It could allow Saudi Arabia to regain one thing it had in 2011, following the Yemeni uprising, and lost again in 2015 with the start of its military intervention in Yemen, which is the ability to be an umbrella over everyone to reach a peace deal in the country. </p><p>A worst-case scenario for the Riyadh Agreement, however, is that it turns into a mass wedding but no one is quite sure who is meant to be married to whom, and chaos ensues. The vastness of the profound military and political reforms that the agreement calls for, the vagueness on the specifics regarding how these reforms should be undertaken and the hyperoptimistic time frame within which they should be completed leaves one to wonder if anything but chaos is possible.</p><p>At best, the current Riyadh Agreement should thus be approached with cautious optimism.</p><p>For the agreement to succeed Saudi Arabia cannot approach it as an end in itself, but as part of a larger effort to reconstitute the Yemeni government, end the conflict and bring about stability in its southern neighbor. Three steps to demonstrate this seriousness would be to: 1) put real money and resources into helping reform Yemeni government finances and economic practices, rather than just throwing money at the problem when it reaches a crisis point; 2) reopen Sana’a Airport to commercial flights, beginning with medical evacuations for those with emergencies; 3) stop deporting hundreds of thousands of Yemeni laborers as part of the Saudi Vision 2030’s aims for ‘Saudization’ of the labour force – in the years to come the loss of these remittances to Yemen, currently the country’s largest source of foreign currency, will cause untold hardship and undoubtedly reignite socioeconomic instability and conflict. </p><p>Whatever the outcome of the Riyadh Agreement, history will remember that Yemeni government and STC leaders alike smiled at the cameras and hailed the Riyadh Agreement as a triumph. These men who denounce the Houthis as Iranian proxies themselves celebrated signing over the country’s sovereignty, and their own legitimacy and authority, to a foreign power.</p><p><span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/8380">https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/8380</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Peace Is Possible in Yemen</strong></p><p>Out of a Moment of Crisis, a Chance for a Solution</p><p>Both within Yemen’s borders and in the wider region, further bloodshed seemed inevitable.</p><p>Yet, in an unexpected turn of events, these flare-ups appear to have opened a pathway to peace. </p><p>If both the Riyadh agreement and the Saudi-Houthi initiative survive, and UN mediators are able to weave them into a single negotiation track, a national political settlement could be possible.</p><p><span>That is a big if. Reaching a national political settlement in Yemen will require both winding down the Saudi-led military intervention and bridging the gaping divides among the country’s many armed groups and political factions. It is entirely possible that current negotiations will grind to a halt or fall apart. If that happens, the conflict will likely deepen and expand. Saudi Arabia and Iran will both intensify their struggle for influence, and Yemen will dissolve further into a mess of warring mini-states, each with its own international backer.</span></p><p>The Saudis appear to have concluded that even if they can’t beat the Houthis militarily, they must at least drive a wedge between the rebels and their Iranian backer with financial and political inducements. To succeed, however, they will need to win over or at least mitigate the influence of Houthi hard-liners while strengthening the hand of Houthi pragmatists by reducing the level of violence, delivering economic gains, and ultimately an end to cross-border hostilities.</p><p>Saudi Arabia’s interest in reviving talks with the Houthis was probably influenced by the UAE’s recent decision to draw down its forces in Yemen. </p><p>Combined, all of these developments form a pathway to a political settlement in Yemen, the most promising that diplomats and UN officials say they have seen in years. </p><p>A LONG WAY TO GO</p><p>A lot could still go wrong. A Houthi missile fired into Saudi Arabia that kills civilians, or a Saudi air strike that kills Yemeni civilians, could restart the cycle of violence. There is also a risk that Saudi Arabia will use the agreement between the STC and the Hadi government not to pursue peace talks but to ramp up the war effort against the Houthis. That is the fear of many diplomats and analysts, and the wish of some anti-Houthi groups and officials in Hadi’s government.</p><p>Just as tenuous is the Saudi-brokered deal between Hadi’s government and the STC. Enmity between the two factions still runs high, and officials from both groups express pessimism over the agreement’s durability. </p><p>The deal is also vaguely worded and offers little guidance on implementation. </p><p>There are also concerns about Riyadh’s capacity to manage implementation of the accord. And given Riyadh’s continued support for Hadi, some in the president’s camp could conclude that they have the upper hand. If Hadi’s government grows overconfident, it could provoke renewed fighting with the STC.</p><p>Even if the southern power-sharing deal holds and the Saudi-Houthi de-escalation process stays on track, the road to durable peace in Yemen will be long and circuitous. Some five years of fighting have swept away large parts of the old order and changed the political landscape of the country. </p><p>Much will turn on Saudi Arabia’s ability and resolve to manage the two different strands of negotiations, and to eventually convince the Hadi government that it must sue for peace with the Houthis. But even as the Saudis facilitate intra-Yemeni negotiations, it is the Yemenis who will determine the outcome. A settlement to the swirling conflicts in Yemen is arguably closer now than at any point in the last five years, but that doesn’t mean that peace is around the corner. Some of the country’s unresolved issues—such as the question of whether the south will secede—may result in more violence no matter what diplomats achieve. Still, there is now a rare window of opportunity to begin winding down the war.

Today Yemen needs a vision which will allow for its youth to look into the future with confidence, strong in the knowledge that tangible actions are being taken to address their most immediate needs.</p><p>Interestingly enough Yemen offers a perfect demographic mirror to what is fast becoming a global challenge – there are more young people than ever (41% of the world population) and almost all share a common fear of a future scarred and marred by economic inequalities, social grievances, and lack of true political representation.</p><p>Yemen has the most youthful age structure in the world outside of sub-Saharan Africa</p><p>If we keep in mind that war exacerbated poverty through a complete meltdown of all civil institutions, notwithstanding the pressure internal population displacement has had on cities such as Sanaa and Aden and it appears evident that Yemen’s political future and the very viability of its nation-state hinges on its political elite’s ability to meet such pressing socio-economic demands.</p><p>Over 20% of Yemen‟s population is aged between 15 and 24 and, according to UN estimates, by 2025 will have increased by 69% – the second fastest growth rate in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Yemen also has high rates of illiteracy and together with Egypt and Iraq, makes up three-quarters of the 10 million illiterate youth in the region – two-thirds of which are girls.</p><p>Yemen’s pre-existing social deficit, the profound lack of basic services such as housing, education, healthcare, sanitation and jobs, has been compounded by political volatility, religious radicalisation, armed conflicts, shortages of food and water and dwindling of natural resources through mismanagement and corruption.

The Houthis reaffirmed that their anti-Israel position is based on a principled, humanitarian, moral, and religious commitment. Historically, neither the Yemeni Army nor the Houthis themselves, have ever targeted Israel directly.</p><p>The threat from Israel is not without precedent. Israel has used claims of alleged Iranian military attachments in countries like Syria and Iraq as justification for airstrikes and bombings against those nations. Now, Israel appears to be using Iran’s alleged presence in Yemen, an allegation that both Tehran and the Houthis deny, as a pretext for military action in the country despite no evidence indicating that there are any Iranian forces present there.</p><p>According to three government officials in Sana’a that spoke to MintPress on the condition of anonymity, the Houthi’s warnings are both serious and well-placed. Those officials said that the government in Sana’a has already confirmed information that Israel is preparing to launch airstrikes on both military sites and civil targets in Yemen, especially on the country’s west coast and along the Saudi-Yemen border in coordination with the Saudi-led Coalition. </p><p>Ansar Allah’s announcement also comes in the wake of a number of recent statements made by a number of Israeli officials claiming that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-iran-yemen/netanyahu-says-iran-seeking-means-to-attack-israel-from-yemen-idUSKBN1X71SA">Yemen has become a threat to Israel</a>. Speaking during a visit by U.S. Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin and White House aid Jared Kushner, Netanyahu claimed that Iran has supplied missiles to the Houthis that could hit Israel. The Houthis regard these statements as a justification and prelude to strikes on the country, similar to those that Israel unilaterally carried out against sites in Syria and Iraq.</p><p>In August, Kuwaiti newspaper al-Jarida <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/467108-israel-prepares-bomb-houthis-iran/">released a report</a> saying that Israel is planning on striking sensitive positions on the Bab al-Mandab strait which links the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, to target “Houthis” in the area. The newspaper, which cited an anonymous informed source, said Israeli intelligence agency Mossad has been monitoring activities in the Yemeni strait.</p><p>Israel’s entry into the Yemen war could indeed open the door for further escalation, a prospect made more likely by both the increased strength of Ansar Allah forces and by Israel’s increasingly cozy relationship with the Gulf Arab countries of the coalition. The fact that Saudi Arabia and the UAE recently <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0e924804-ec31-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061">sought negotiations</a> with Houthis after they were <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-saudi-failed-yemen-iran-bad-news-for-israel-hamas-hezbollah-1.7653157">unable to win the war militarily</a>, despite their superior firepower and funding, only increases the likelihood of Israel’s entry into Yemen.</p><p>In fact, Israel is alleged to have <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190827-maariv-israel-involved-in-yemeni-conflict-to-serve-saudi-lover/">already participated</a> in the war against Yemen on behalf of the Saudi-led coalition as a part of a series of covert interventions involving mercenary forces, the reported launching of dozens of airstrikes in the country and even the <a href="https://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/09/24/how-israel-was-busted-nuking-yemen/">dropping of a neutron bomb</a> on Nuqm Mountain in the middle the capital Sana’a in May of 2015.</p><p><span>Kicking the hornet’s nest</span></p><p>Like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, there is a problem with the Israeli assessment of the situation in Yemen, as the Houthis have never threatened to hit an Israeli target and Houthi attacks on Saudi-led Coalition countries have always been retaliatory, not preemptive. There are no vital targets to be bombed in Yemen as the Saudi-led coalition has already nearly destroyed nearly every potential target, including civilian infrastructure. Moreover, any attack by Israel against Yemen will gain the Houthis even more popular support both inside of Yemen and across the Islamic and Arab world.</p><p>Furthermore, there is no evidence that Iran has any military sites or experts in Yemen, and Yemen’s Army, loyal to Ansar Allah, are not the “Iran proxy fighters” that international media so often claims them to be</p><p>Meanwhile, many Israeli activists and media pundits are expressing concerns over what they consider serious threats from Yemen, pointing out that these threats “should not be underestimated by the Israelis.” The Israeli security parliament <a href="https://nthnews.net/en/yemennews/al-houthi-warnings-to-israel-should-not-be-underestimated-hebrew-media/">said that Israeli intelligence</a> must strictly monitor Yemen and take necessary steps to secure Israeli ships sailing in the Bab Al-Mandab area, describing the statements made by Abdulmalik al-Houthi as serious.</p><p><span>A well-stocked arsenal</span></p><p>Indeed the threats of Ansar Allah, a group known to strike sensitive targets without hesitation, are not without precedent</p><p>However, it would be difficult for the Yemeni Army to prevent aerial attacks by Israel. Yemeni airspace has been open to the coalition and to American drones since the war broke out in 2015. Any attack by the Yemen army would likely come in retaliation to an Israeli attack and would hit Israeli military bases in Eritrea, Israeli ships in the Red Sea as well as hit vital targets deep inside of Israel, according to Yemeni military sources – by Ahmed Abdulkareem</p><p><span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/houthis-preparing-planned-israel-attack-yemen/262730/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/houthis-preparing-planned-israel-attack-yemen/262730/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Could education in Yemen be new 'proxy battleground' in the Gulf?</strong></p><p><span>Disinformation warfare</span></p><p><span>Today, however, Yemen is one of numerous areas in a campaign of disinformation warfare waged against Doha by the very partners Qatar had supported in their war in Yemen in 2015. The blockade against Qatar, which Yemen's internationally recognized government joined the day of its implementation, left hundreds of Qatari soldiers and officers stranded in the kingdom, which they had set out to protect.</span></p><p>Withdrawing from the campaign, which Qatar only reluctantly joined in 2015 for its lack of political strategy, was a blessing in disguise</p><p>Nonetheless, the strategic communication disaster in the West over Yemen did not stop Riyadh and Abu Dhabi from using Yemen as a platform for its war of narratives against Doha. As part of a disinformation campaign against the emirate that has raged since May/June 2017, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have accused Qatar of siding with the Houthis.</p><p>Such claims are part of efforts to portray Doha as a player that destabilizes the region by partnering with "terrorists" and "extremists" – narratives that have already been floated in the West to justify the siege against Qatar.</p><p>The latest example of Yemen becoming a flashpoint issue in the GCC crisis came earlier this month when Hadi's government lashed out at Qatar, accusing the emirate of financing hateful textbooks to sow sectarian hatred in northern Yemen.</p><p>According to the Yemeni government's Ministry of Education, Qatar Charity is guilty of paying for Houthi-produced textbooks that promote the Islamic Republic of Iran's agenda and ideology.</p><p>Even prior to the Yemeni civil war, Yemen, which was the poorest Arab country, had a major education crisis. For easily understandable reasons, Yemen's educational system has suffered enormously from this war.</p><p>Currently, 2 million Yemeni children are unable to attend school due to the war. Within this context, any outside state attempting to help Yemen meet its extremely difficult challenges of educating its youth amid this warfare can obtain influence and soft power in the conflict-torn country.</p><p>A question raised by Elisabeth Kendall is whether Yemen's education crisis has become the Middle East's newest "proxy battleground." The narrative about Qatar Charity financing hateful textbooks in northern Yemen, which Hadi's government and its backers in the GCC are pushing, is that Qatar is allying with Iran and the Houthis to produce, as one Yemeni scholar put it, a "new sectarian generation" among the youth in Yemen.</p><p>This narrative is inconsistent with the inclusive work that Qatar Charity is doing in Yemen. Against the backdrop of Qatar's global education agenda, enabling more than 10 million children to get liberal education across the world through organizations such as Education Above All, Qatar Charity, a government-licensed nongovernmental organization, would not work to undermine Qatar's formidable legacy in education.</p><p>Moreover, since the blockade began, Qatar's Ministry of Education has taken a stance at home against sectarianism, removing any such references in its textbooks that originate from Wahabi teachings in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Thus, the purpose of this disinformation campaign is not a genuine concern for Qatar's work in Yemen. Instead, the goal is to advance the narrative that Qatar is actually colluding with Iran and its local surrogates against the West's interests.</p><p>The Hadi government, which is ultimately Riyadh's surrogate in Yemen, levying such accusations not only factors into Saudi Arabia's current foreign policy aimed at ostracizing Qatar but also into a longer history of the kingdom fearing Qatari influence in Yemen.</p><p>Seeing Qatar returning to Yemen albeit through humanitarian aid and being able to serve people on all sides of the conflict equally from a position of neutrality is hard for the kingdom to accept at a time when the Yemen war might be the biggest stain on Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's reputation, both domestically and internationally – by ANDREAS KRIEG and GIORGIO CAFIERO</p><p><span><a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2019/11/11/could-education-in-yemen-be-new-proxy-battleground-in-the-gulf">https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2019/11/11/could-education-in-yemen-be-new-proxy-battleground-in-the-gulf</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2><p>(* B H)</p><p><span>Dengue fever started spreading quickly in some districts &amp; villages in Western province of </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hodeidah?src=hashtag_click">#Hodeidah</a></span><span>. 41 people have been reported death in the last week due to epdmic outbreak.

As ordered by Saudi Arabia, they admitted all the previous attacks on Saudi Arabia to have been launched from Yemen, and now as they are ordered again, they say it is impossible for Yemen to target oil refineries!”</p><p><em>Q: Saudi Arabia claims Iran carried out the attacks on Saudi oil facilities. Is Yemen unable to reach such targets?</em></p><p>A: Saudi Arabia bases its claim on the distance between Yemen and Abqaiq oil facilities, saying it is too far to be reached from Yemen; even though, Yemeni drones have already targeted the pipelines pumping the stations in east of Yanbu, west Riyadh and the Abu Dhabi airport, with the same distance if not more. Yemeni forces even managed to carry out missile-attack on Dammam with a longer distance.</p><p>As the war started, Saudi-backed coalition claimed that they target missile and drone factories in areas controlled by Ansarallah; and with that excuse, they bombed civilians, hospitals, prisons, weddings, funerals, schools, markets and all Yemeni infrastructure. If, as they themselves admit, we have drone technology, why should Iran send all weapons or target Abqaiq?</p><p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s claim that Iran smuggles weapons to Yemen is not accepted anymore by the world. Because no one believes ballistic missiles which are 12 meters long, drones and other weaponries can be delivered to Yemen via the closed ports and airports which are under the control of Ansarallah. Everything delivered to these areas is fully inspected by the coalition forces and the UN.</p><p>The reason for Saudi Arabia to claim Iran attacked the oil facility is to get more support from the West. It has a history of begging support from foreigners, and even Muslim countries, when they claimed that Ansarallah targeted The holy city of Mecca. </p><p>On the other hand, Saudi failure against Ansarallah has put Riyadh in a bad situation, because if the coalition backed by the US, UK and France, could not defy Ansarallah, which Saudi for its turn claims to be supported by Iran, how would they be able to defeat Iran itself in any possible war!</p><p><span><a href="https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980818001068">https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980818001068</a></span></p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p><span>Yemeni Coast Guard blocks smuggled explosives shipment</span></p><p>Yemeni Coastguard forces have blocked the smuggling of explosives-making materials into the Red Sea waters en route to the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel militia.</p><p>The Yemeni Coast Guard has seized a consignment of 100 tons of fertilizer containing 46% urea, which is used in the manufacture of explosives.</p><p>The cargo was seized aboard a medium sea boat, sailing in the waters of the Red Sea.</p><p><span><a href="http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/11/09/coast-guard-blocks-smuggled-explosives-shipment/">http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/11/09/coast-guard-blocks-smuggled-explosives-shipment/</a></span> = <span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/14746">http://en.adenpress.news/news/14746</a></span></p><p><span>Film: </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sGQ7xkCfG4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sGQ7xkCfG4</a></span></p><p>My comment: Urea in fertilizer – really, piss on it….</p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>As Saudi Arabia grows desperate, this could be the beginning of the end of the war in Yemen</p><p>The kingdom has found itself vulnerable on an unprecedented level.

Funktioniert es, dann wird der STC politisch und militärisch völlig in die jemenitische Regierung integriert. Damit hätte auch Saudi-Arabien die Zügel im Jemen wieder völlig in der Hand.

Es heißt jedoch, dass er das Jemen-Dossier von MbS völlig übernommen hat.</p><p>MbS – der 2015 in den Jemen-Krieg einstieg – bekennt sich in Interviews nun zu einer politischen Lösung im Jemen.

Instead, existing proxy wars in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon will intensify while sectarian strains in countries like Bahrain, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia that are home to both Sunni and Shiite Muslim communities will worsen. At the heart of the battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran is a four decade-old existential battle for dominance not only in the Middle East and North Africa but in the Muslim world as a whole. It is a battle that started with the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, the first toppling by a popular revolt of both a monarch and an icon of US power in the region. Concerned that the Iranian revolution would offer a form of Islamic governance involving a degree of popular sovereignty that would challenge Saudi Arabia’s absolute monarchy which cloaks itself in a puritan interpretation of Islam, the kingdom went on the warpath.</p><p>In doing so, it launched the single largest dedicated public diplomacy campaign in World War Two history, spending up to $100 billion since 1979 on the funding of Muslim cultural institutions across the globe and forging close ties to non-Wahhabi Muslim leaders and intelligence agencies that have adopted its worldview. The result has been Muslim societies like Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh have under Wahhabi and Salafi influence and the playing with religion by governments become more conservative. The spread of Saudi Wahhabism and Salafism has also sparked more militant groups. Saudi-Iranian relations were despite occasional periods of cooperation further poisoned by the kingdom’s funding of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein’s eight year-long war against Iran in the 1980s. It’s a battle that Saudi Arabia can only win as long as Iran has not fully returned to the international fold and recovered with the lifting of debilitating international sanctions – by James M.

The Russian backing to the Iranian policy and the initial American-Saudi cooperation, its indirect engagement in regional conflicts by supporting opposing forces as well as the nuclear programs of the two actors, allegedly aiming to develop atomic weapons, pictured the situation as an extension of the Cold War. Sectarian differences – Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia – do play an important role in regional dynamics but more as instruments than as main feature of the turmoil; economic gains and the struggle for influence prevail, the two powers crossing sectarian boundaries in order to pursue their political ambitions.</p><p>Saudi Arabia was “betrayed” by some of its allies, like the UAE and Egypt. While an UAE financed worldwide Islamic conference concluded that Wahhabism does not belong to Sunni Islam, challenging again the Saudis legitimacy, Egypt voted in favor of Russia’s UN resolution, and established closer ties with Iran.

Iran's 1979 revolution, the fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and the Arab Spring in turn increased the disagreement between the two regional powers. This article examines the relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia in the Middle East between 2011 and 2017. Both countries claim to have leadership over other Islamic Muslim countries in the Middle East, in which Iran as a Shia state and Saudi Arabia as a Sunni-Wahhabi state have multiple ideological and political conflicts that have drawn opposing interests for each other. As a result, new multifactor regional international situation involving Iran and Saudi Arabia arose, to analyze which it would make sense to apply the general scientific analytical methods (logical, typological, inductive-deductive methods, etc.), and a number of specific methods for direct study of international relations, including those based on a systemic approach. The author examines the two powerful Middle Eastern countries with an emphasis on instrumental sectarianism as an important component of the regional order transformation proсess, understanding Iran as one of the superior powers of the region in the context of Islamic discourse and the same role of Saudi Arabia with strong tendency in the framework of Arab discourse.

It is the opposite. Both states are struggling fiercely for influence and power in the region, particularly at “the nexus of Shiite and Sunni worlds” (Henderson 2014), i.e. Iraq, currently immersed in a highly brutal civil war, but also and most recently, Yemen, where both states are involved in a “proxy war”. Although the scale of Iranian involvement in Iraq in unknown, it is believed that Iran trains and controls local armed groups, sends military advisors as well as provides military hardware. Saudi Arabia is trying to seize the bridgeheads and neutralize Iran’s influence. Such rivalry is no surprise as strategic aims are at stake.

The Kingdom has resorted to playing the sectarian card in response to the ideological challenge posed by Iran, which tries to woo Sunni Muslims to its side by advocating a political system that combines Islam and a democracy of sorts. For its part, the Islamic Republic prefers to downplay the Sunni-Shiite split and emphasises the need for Islamic unity against foreign enemies, notably Israel and the US.

At the same time, the September attack rang alarm bells: betting so much on the non-interventionist Trump to confront Iran could be counterproductive. </p><p>Thus, Saudi Arabia, actively seeks either de-escalation or a halt to the rise in tensions. Riyadh has responded to conciliatory messages by Tehran via the Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan.

Iran’s foreign policy actions in the region have often been interpreted as suspicious as well as posing ideological and sectarian threat by the other Middle East countries that have Shia minorities/majorities in their territories. At that point, Syria war constitutes a relevant example to analyze the determinants of Iran’s foreign policy in the Middle East. This study attempts at applying neorealism to analyze the motivations of Iran’s foreign policy in the Middle East. It argues that Iran’s foreign policy in Syria needs to be seen beyond the discourse of proxy war; rather it aims at securing Iran’s regional power bases as well as projecting Iranian power to Syria and across the region – by Hazal Muslu El Berni</p><p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/36317324/Irans_Security_Dilemma_in_The_Middle_East_A_Neorealist_Approach_to_Irans_Foreign_Policy_in_Syria?auto=bookmark">https://www.academia.edu/36317324/Irans_Security_Dilemma_in_The_Middle_East_A_Neorealist_Approach_to_Irans_Foreign_Policy_in_Syria?auto=bookmark</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp11 Deutschland / Germany</span></h2><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p>GKKE fordert Waffenembargo an Jemenkriegskoalition</p><p>Die Gemeinsame Konferenz Kirche und Entwicklung fordert einen langfristigen Stopp deutscher Rüstungsexporte an die am Jemen-Krieg beteiligten Staaten und den Einsatz der Bundesregierung für ein EU-Waffenembargo an diese Länder.</p><p><span><a href="https://info.brot-fuer-die-welt.de/blog/gkke-fordert-waffenembargo-jemenkriegskoalition">https://info.brot-fuer-die-welt.de/blog/gkke-fordert-waffenembargo-jemenkriegskoalition</a></span></p><p><span>(A H P)</span></p><p>Zwei Monate Duldung für jemenitische Familie in Bosau</p><p>Nach einer von der Bundespolizei gestoppten Abschiebung auf dem Hamburger Flughafen hat eine sechsköpfige jemenitische Flüchtlingsfamilie aus dem Kreis Ostholstein zwei Monate Duldung bis Januar erhalten.
