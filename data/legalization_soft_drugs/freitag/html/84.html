Gegen die deutschsprachigen russischen Medien hetzen sie aber schon gerne. Warum eigentlich?</p><p>Schon mehrmals war zu beobachten, dass die deutschen Mainstreammedien offenbar noch höriger gegenüber den transatlantischen Interessen waren als die amerikanischen und britischen. Was dort recht ausführlich dargestellt wurde, fehlt im deutschen Mainstream ganz. Auf Deutsch gab es das dann nur bei RT oder Sputnik. Diese sind also mittlerweile unentbehrlich – nicht weil sie so gut oder objektiv sind, sondern weil die deutschen Mainstreammedien so grottenschlecht sind, wenn es um sog. „transatlantische“ Interessen geht. Und zu dem 100%-Propagandamodus, den unsere Medien dann alle einschalten, gehört als (einfachste) Variante eben auch: Unbequemes weglassen. So wie hier.</p><p>Die Berichte beziehen sich auf:</p><p><strong>23.5.2016 – Amnesty International (*** A K)</strong></p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia-led coalition has used UK-manufactured cluster bombs in Yemen - new evidence</strong></p><p><em>Letter to David Cameron calls for urgent investigation into ‘scandal’ of UK-supplied BL-755 cluster bomb being used in village in northern Yemen</em></p><p><em>Government is asked for ‘full disclose’ over whether UK personnel have played any part in dropping banned cluster bombs from UK-supplied Tornado jets</em></p><p><em>Yemeni villages turned into cluster bomb ‘minefields’, with thousands of ‘bomblets’ liable to kill civilians - children especially at risk</em></p><p><em> ‘Cluster bombs are one of the nastiest weapons in the history of warfare … it’s truly shocking that a British cluster munition has been dropped on a civilian area in Yemen’ - Oliver Sprague</em></p><p>Amnesty International has written to prime minister David Cameron and other senior ministers demanding a full Government inquiry into new evidence that Saudi Arabia-led coalition forces have used UK-manufactured cluster bombs - which may have killed and injured civilians, including children - in the conflict in Yemen.</p><p>During recent field research in Sa’da, Hajjah, and Sanaa governorates near the Yemen-Saudi Arabia border, Amnesty found a partially-exploded UK-manufactured “BL-755” cluster bomb, as well as other evidence of US and Brazilian cluster munitions which had been used by the Saud Arabia-led coalition forces.</p><p>The UK cluster bomb, which had apparently malfunctioned, had left scores of unexploded “bomblets” strewn over a wide area near a farm in Al-khadhra village in Hajjah governorate, six miles from the Saudi Arabia border. A local farmer reported seeing the cluster bomb attack in January this year. The cluster bomb had been retrieved - at great risk - by staff from local Yemeni de-mining organisation, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Center, and was being stored at a de-mining depot in Hayran district, in Hajjah, when seen by Amnesty experts.</p><p>The discovery of the cluster bomb - originally manufactured by the Bedfordshire company Hunting Engineering Ltd in the 1970s - is the first clear evidence that, as long suspected, members of the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition have used British cluster munitions in their highly controversial attacks in Yemen.</p><p>The BL-755 weapon, now banned under international law, contains 147 bomblets which scatter on impact with the ground but frequently don’t detonate until they’re later picked up, often by civilians unaware of their deadly nature. The bomblets are designed to burn through tank armour and then explode into more than 2,000 metal fragments. Families returning home in northern Yemen after a year of conflict are at grave risk of death or serious injury from the thousands of unexploded bomblets that now litter villages, farmland and the surrounding countryside in these areas. One man, who herds goats in a village in Hajjah governorate approximately six miles from the Saudi Arabia border, told Amnesty: “In the area next to us, there are bombs hanging off the trees.”</p><p>Cluster munitions are banned by over 100 countries, including the UK, and campaigners argue that the UK has a strong moral responsibility to ensure that any cluster bombs - such as the BL-755 - sold in the past are traced and that measures taken to destroy existing stockpiles. Since the 1980s and 1990s the UK is thought to have sold large numbers of cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia and the UAE (which is also part of the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition), and the weapon is known to be in the current ordnance stockpiles of both Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p><p>The BL-755 is designed to be dropped from the UK Tornado fighter jet, scores of which the UK has sold to Saudi Arabia. Given that the UK is known to have several hundred specialist support staff working closely with the Royal Saudi Air Force, Amnesty is warning that any involvement of UK personnel - whether in Saudi Arabia or in a liaison or political role in the UK - would constitute a clear breach of the UK’s legal responsibility under the Convention on Cluster Munitions. The BL-755 found in Al-khadhra village is the first confirmed use of UK-made cluster munitions since the entry into force of the cluster munitions convention in 2008.</p><p>Amnesty interviewed 30 people - including survivors of cluster bomb submunitions and other unexploded ordnance, as well as their families, eyewitnesses, de-mining experts, activists and members of the emergency services - documenting ten new cases in which 16 civilians, including nine children, were killed or maimed by cluster bombs between July 2015 and last month. These incidents took place days, weeks or sometimes months after the bombs were dropped by coalition forces in Yemen.</p><p>Amnesty International UK’s Arms Control Director Oliver Sprague said:</p><p class="Zitat">“Cluster bombs are one of the nastiest weapons in the history of warfare, rightly banned by more than 100 countries, so it’s truly shocking that a British cluster munition has been dropped on a civilian area in Yemen.</p><p class="Zitat">“Given that this type of cluster bomb is very likely to have been used in combination with Tornado war planes which the UK has also sold to Saudi Arabia, there’s even a possibility that British support personnel might have been involved in the cluster bombing of Yemen. This would be an absolute scandal if confirmed.</p><p class="Zitat">“The UK should have been tracking down all the now-banned cluster bombs it’s sold to Saudi Arabia over the years and pressing for them to be safely disposed of. Instead, shamefully, it’s now come to light that a UK cluster bomb has been used in Yemen, spraying its deadly bomblets all over a village and jeopardising the lives of men, women and children.</p><p class="Zitat">“There needs to be a full investigation into both this incident and all aspects of the UK’s arming of Saudi Arabia and other countries involved in the carnage in Yemen.</p><p class="Zitat">“Amongst other things, we need categorical assurances that no UK person has been involved in the cluster bombing of Yemen, with full disclosure of what was known, when and by whom.</p><p class="Zitat">“It shouldn’t have taken the discovery of a UK cluster bomb in Yemen to push Downing Street to do the right thing, but surely now ministers will suspend all further arms sales to Saudi Arabia and its partners pending the outcome of a full investigation.”</p><p>Children killed and maimed while herding family’s goats</p><p>On 1 March, an eight-year-old boy was killed when he and his 11-year-old brother encountered multiple cluster bomblets while herding goats near a village in al-Safra directorate in Sa’da. The elder brother told Amnesty that he and his sibling were playing with the bomblets for several hours when one exploded, killing the younger one instantly and injuring the 11-year-old. The older brother lost three fingers, needed an operation to insert steel plates into his shattered jaw and sustained shrapnel injuries to his chest and legs. He said:</p><p class="Zitat">“We go down every day to the valley to herd goats, where there are many small bombs. We found four of them in the morning … they were cylindrical with a red ribbon. We carried them with us while herding. At around 1pm, I started to take the red string with my right hand and pull and [my brother] pulled on the other end of it and then it went off and I fell back. [My brother] was hurt in his stomach and he had fallen down too. We didn’t know it would hurt us.”</p><p>In a similar incident, on 16 April in a village in Hajjah governorate about six miles from the Saudi Arabia border, a 12-year-old boy was killed and his nine-year-old brother injured when they played with cluster bomb submunitions while herding goats in the valley nearby. The surviving brother told Amnesty:</p><p class="Zitat">“I found the bomb and I went and gave it to [my brother] so he can have one and I had one. Ali hit them against each other and they exploded and I found myself lying on the ground. The explosion pushed me back [several metres]. Two or three days before the accident, my friend and I used to go and collect the bombs and put them in a bag and hide them under and between the trees. They have a white ribbon.”</p><p>His 12-year-old brother was killed on the spot, with his abdomen torn open and his arm severed. The boys’ father told Amnesty that the family had only recently returned to the area after being displaced by airstrikes. He said they now don’t go to the valley after the incident but there are no safe spaces to herd their goats: “In the area next to us, there are bombs hanging off the trees,” he said. Other goat herders told Amnesty that the prevalence of bomblets in grazing areas has forced them to keep their goats locked up and feed them straw, which is costly and unsustainable. In most cases, farmers and herders told Amnesty they had no choice but to work in areas affected hit by cluster bombs despite the risks.</p><p>Amnesty also interviewed a 13-year-old boy who was injured in January after apparently picking up a bomblet near a spring that locals rely on for water in a small village surrounded by agricultural land in al-Safra, Sa’da governorate, some 15 miles from the Saudi Arabia border. The boy said the bomblets were green and shaped like “a small ball that you play with”, apparently bomblets from a US-made BLU-63 weapon. The boy explained:</p><p class="Zitat">“I saw the bomb [submunition] close to where we were filling water and as I was walking along I saw it [on the ground]. I picked it up and I threw it [to the side] and it exploded. I got hurt and then [my brother] went to get help…”.</p><p>The 13-year-old was hospitalised for two months and had an operation on his abdomen. He says there are still submunitions by the spring.</p><p>In many instances, civilians told Amnesty that they have had to resort to removing bomblets themselves, fearing that children will pick them up or their livestock be killed. Hindi Ibrahim, a 25-year-old father of two from Dugheij Village, Hayran, Hajjah governorate, told Amnesty how his arm was injured by an explosion when he and other villagers attempted to clear hundreds of bomblets from their village:</p><p class="Zitat">“The original airstrike happened late last July or August during the day and [some of] the bomblets exploded. There were also Apaches [helicopters] that shot at people as they ran away. There were 500 pieces in the village everywhere … we wanted to remove them. Some were inside the house in the courtyard and kitchen … [the de-mining organisation] kept on promising they would come but they never came. They told us they were busy in other areas. By February, we were forced to clean them ourselves because of the children. At the time I went into the house and put ten [submunitions] on a tray and carried them out of the house. The bombs started hitting against each other and one went off. I dropped the tray and the rest went off.”</p><p>Hindi Ibrahim sustained shrapnel injuries to his abdomen, arm and hip. Hindi’s brother Weedi, 30, and his nephew, Yahya Shawqi, 15, were also injured when they handled bomblets in the village, and two other villagers were killed in recent months.</p><p>Civilians describe dire need for de-mining assistance</p><p>Recognising the serious risk unexploded ordnance presents to the civilian population, Yemen’s sole de-mining agency, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (YEMAC), began clearing and detonating the weapons in Sa’da and Hajjah in early April despite being ill-equipped and trained. While the full extent of cluster munition contamination is not yet known, in the first three weeks of their work YEMAC says its teams working in Sa’da and Hajjah cleared at least 418 cluster bomb submunitions, 810 fuses, 51 mortars and more than 70 missiles. Tragically, the centre had to abruptly halt its operations on 26 April after three of its staff - Mohammed Ahmed Ali Al Sharafi, Mustafa Abdullah Saleh Al Harazi and Hussein Abdo Mohssien Al Salami - were killed in a cluster munition accident in Dugheij village in Hayran, Hajjah governorate.</p><p>International assistance is urgently needed to de-mine contaminated areas and countries with influence should urge the Saudi Arabia-led coalition forces to stop using cluster bomb munitions, which are internationally banned and inherently indiscriminate.</p><p>Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Advisor Lama Fakih said:</p><p class="Zitat">“Even after hostilities have died down, the lives and livelihoods of civilians, including young children, continue to be on the line in Yemen as they return to de facto minefields. They cannot live in safety until contaminated areas in and around their homes and fields are identified and cleared of deadly cluster bomb submunitions and other unexploded ordnance.</p><p class="Zitat">“Without a concerted effort to stop the Saudi Arabia-led coalition from using cluster munitions and urgent international support for de-mining, these cluster bombs and other explosive remnants of war will pose a deadly legacy in Yemen for years to come, posing a threat to civilian lives and wreaking havoc on the local economy.”</p><p>US and Brazilian cluster bombs</p><p>Since the start of the conflict, Amnesty has documented the use of six types of cluster munitions in Yemen by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, and other credible sources - including Human Rights Watch - have also documented their use.</p><p>Amnesty has recently identified a Brazilian-manufactured Avibras ASTROS cluster munition rocket which dispenses submunitions and US-manufactured CBU-105 sensor-fused bombs with BLU-108/B canisters. A US Department of Defense contract worth $641 million for the manufacture of 1,300 CBU-105 sensor-fused weapons for Saudi Arabia was agreed in 2013. The BLU-108, manufactured by Textron Defense Systems, is an air-delivered container, containing four further smart “Skeet” submunitions. The BLU-108 is released from its dispenser and a parachute deploys to slow its descent. It then fires the four rapidly-rotating Skeets, which use multi-mode optical sensors to identify a suitable target. On detonation, an explosively-formed penetrator breaks through armour producing incendiary effects, as well as a fragmentation ring to damage human targets. The presence of BLU-108 submunitions in Yemen which have failed to detonate or self-destruct contradict claims by the US Security Defense Cooperation Agency that these munitions do not result in more than 1% unexploded ordnance “across the range of intended operational environments.” The US Government prohibits the sale or transfer of cluster munitions with greater than a 1% fail rate, a “standard” which it appears to be failing to meet.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and partners have legal responsibility to avoid indiscriminate weapon usage</p><p>The USA and Brazil have so far both failed to join the Convention on Cluster Munitions, and likewise Yemen, Saudi Arabia and other coalition members are also outside the convention. However, under customary international humanitarian law, coalition members must avoid using inherently indiscriminate weapons, which invariably pose a threat to civilians, and they have a responsibility to facilitate clearance of areas contaminated with unexploded ordnance.</p><p>Amnesty is calling on members of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition to immediately provide the UN with detailed data on its cluster munition attacks in Yemen - including maps, exact dates of strikes, specific types and quantities of weapons used - in order to facilitate clearance and risk-education activities, and to reduce the potential for further civilian casualties. Meanwhile, countries in a position to do so should provide all possible technical, financial, material and other assistance to facilitate the marking and clearance, removal or destruction of cluster submunitions, duds and other explosive remnants of war. They should also provide victim assistance, including for the medical and psychological care and rehabilitation of victims and their families, as well as education over the risk of encountering unexploded ordnance. Yemeni diplomats indicated on 19 May at a UN conference that Yemen is strongly considering acceding to the cluster munitions convention given the degree to which the country has been affected by the weapon.</p><p>For years, Amnesty and others have been calling on all countries to immediately halt the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions and to join the Convention on Cluster Munitions. The convention prohibits the production, use, sale and transfer of cluster munitions, and Amnesty is insisting that the UK - as a significant past manufacturer and supplier of the weapons - has a strong moral obligation to assist with the clearance of areas currently affected by them, not least those that may have been struck by UK-made cluster munitions. Since February Amnesty has also urged all countries to ensure that no party to the conflict in Yemen is supplied - either directly or indirectly - with weapons, munitions, military equipment or technology that could be used in the conflict until they end serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and support independent, impartial investigations into allegations of violations by all parties.</p><p>Cluster munition types Amnesty has documented in Yemen armed conflict</p><p>US CBU-58 A/B bomb dispensing US BLU-63 submunitions - air-launched, USA origin, stockpiled by Saudi Arabia, Morocco</p><p>CBU-87 bomb dispensing US BLU-97 submunitions - air-launched, USA origin, stockpiled by Saudi Arabia, UAE</p><p>CBU-105 sensor-fused bomb with BLU-108/B canisters and unexploded “Skeet” submunitions - air-launched, USA origin, stockpiled by Saudi Arabia, UAE</p><p>BL-755 cluster bomb with 147 high-explosive dual-purpose bomblets - air-launched, UK origin, stockpiled by Saudi Arabia, UAE</p><p>ASTROS II rocket motor which can be fitted with up to 65 submunitions - ground-launched, Brazil origin, stockpiled by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain</p><p>M42/M46 or M77 “Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition” - ground-launched, USA origin, stockpiled by UAE, Bahrain, Egypt</p><p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/saudi-arabia-led-coalition-has-used-uk-manufactured-cluster-bombs-yemen-new-evidence">https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/saudi-arabia-led-coalition-has-used-uk-manufactured-cluster-bombs-yemen-new-evidence</a> and in short by Reuters <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-britain-arms-idUSKCN0YE26W">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-britain-arms-idUSKCN0YE26W</a> and by The Independent: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/british-made-cluster-bomb-found-in-yemeni-village-targeted-by-saudi-led-coalition-a7042626.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/british-made-cluster-bomb-found-in-yemeni-village-targeted-by-saudi-led-coalition-a7042626.html</a> and by RT: <a href="https://www.rt.com/uk/344056-cluster-bombs-yemen-saudi/">https://www.rt.com/uk/344056-cluster-bombs-yemen-saudi/</a></p><p>Comment: Nobody should be astonished about that.</p><p>23.5.2016 – Oxfam (* A K P)</p><p>Reaction: Reports of UK-manufactured cluster bombs used in Yemen</p><p>In response to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/saudi-arabia-led-coalition-has-used-uk-manufactured-cluster-bombs-yemen-new-evidence"><strong>Amnesty International's report</strong></a> of UK manufactured cluster bombs being used in Yemen, Mark Goldring, Chief Executive of Oxfam GB, said:</p><p>"This underlines a simple truth - Britain's arms sales and technical military support are fuelling a brutal war in Yemen. <br /> "The war has left more than 80 percent of the population in urgent need of aid, and kills or injures six children a day. <br /> "If Britain wants to be a moral force in the world it should immediately halt all support for this war and put pressure on all involved to stop the reckless disregard of civilians' safety."</p><p><a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/05/reaction-report-of-uk-manufactured-cluster-bombs-used-in-yemen#Qu3o0gyYUrpig3LR.01">http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/05/reaction-report-of-uk-manufactured-cluster-bombs-used-in-yemen#Qu3o0gyYUrpig3LR.01</a></p><p>And read the standard British government's reaction here:</p><p><strong>23.5.2016 – The Independent (** A K P)</strong></p><p><strong><span>British-made cluster bomb found in Yemeni village targeted by Saudi-led coalition</span></strong></p><p>A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “The UK is not a member of the Saudi-led Coalition.

The use of cluster bombs is banned under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, to which the UK is a State Party.<br /> The organization interviewed 30 people, including survivors of cluster bomb submunitions and other unexploded ordnance (UXO) as well as their families, eyewitnesses, demining experts, activists and first responders.<br /> It documented 10 new cases in which 16 civilians were injured or killed by cluster munitions between July 2015 and April 2016. This includes nine children, two of whom were killed. These casualties took place days, weeks, and sometimes months after the bombs were dropped by coalition forces in Yemen. <br /> With a lull in fighting along the Yemeni-Saudi border since a local ceasefire was agreed in March 2016, civilians began returning home and felt safer moving around the governorates of Hajjah and Sa’da. But demining officials, local residents and first responders told Amnesty International they continued to see civilians injured by explosions, with a rise in casualties from unexploded ordnance particularly in areas along the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border including in Midi, Haradh, Hayran, Bakil al-Mir, and Mustabah in Hajjah governorate and al-Safra, Razih, Shada and Baqim in Sa’da governorate.<br /> Many civilians, including children, are now exposed to potentially deadly submunitions and other explosive remnants of war without any knowledge of their presence or the risk they pose. Meanwhile, recent flood waters have moved the submunitions and other unexploded ordnance into areas where civilians do not expect them to be.<br /> Up to this point, the Saudi Arabia-led coalition has not formally confirmed its use of cluster munitions. However, in an<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2016/01/11/saudi-arabia-severs-ties-with-iran-after-attacks-ahmed-asiri-intv-with-robertson-live-ctw.cnn"> interview with CNN on 11 January 2016</a>, the spokesperson of the coalition’s military forces, General Ahmed al-Asiri, categorically denied that the coalition had used cluster munitions in attacks anywhere in Yemen other than in one instance, describing the use of air-dropped CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed Weapons on a military target in Hajjah in April 2015.</p><p><strong>Civilians describe dire need of assistance to clear contaminated areas</strong></p><p>Recognizing the serious risk unexploded ordnance presents to the civilian population, Yemen’s sole demining agency, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (YEMAC), began clearing and detonating the weapons in Sa’da and Hajjah in early April 2016, despite being ill-equipped and trained.<br /> While the full extent of cluster munition contamination is not yet known, in the first three weeks of their work, YEMAC records show its teams working in Sa’da and Hajjah governorates cleared at least 418 cluster bomb submunitions, 810 fuses and artillery remnants, 51 mortars and more than 70 missiles.</p><p>Tragically, the centre had to abruptly halt its clearing operations on 26 April after three of its staff members, Mohammed Ahmed Ali Al Sharafi, Mustafa Abdullah Saleh Al Harazi, and Hussein Abdo Mohssien Al Salami, were killed in a cluster munition incident while carrying out their work in Hayran in Hajjah governorate.<br /> The Director of YEMAC, Ahmed Yahya Alawi, told Amnesty International that the centre’s clearance work was suspended pending an investigation into the men’s deaths, but that he believed the deaths were caused by one of the men’s failure to take adequate precautions in moving the submunitions and his proximity to his colleagues when doing so. He blamed the men’s inadequate training and lamented the ineffectiveness and age of their equipment.<br /> “[Different] types of cluster munitions have been used [by the coalition] but we have only worked with four of the types before. We were surprised by the new kind. They are more sensitive… It is difficult to get explosives to detonate the bombs but storing them is dangerous” he said. “We need to bring in trainers from the countries that made the weapons to train the employees…[and] we are looking for better technology to destroy these bombs.”</p><p>“Donor countries must act quickly to support local efforts to safely and urgently locate, mark and clear areas contaminated by unexploded ordnance and educate affected communities on how to avoid danger in the meantime,” said Lama Fakih.</p><p>“Failure to do so will be a ticking time bomb for civilians, including children, living in affected areas.”<br /> Children are particularly at risk of picking up and playing with submunitions, which they mistake for toys, given their small size and shape. Some roughly resemble drink cans, while others resemble balls.<br /> Amnesty International interviewed a 13-year-old boy who was injured in the late afternoon on a day in January 2016 after apparently picking up a submunition near a spring that locals rely on for water in Noug’a, a small village surrounded by agricultural land in al-Safra, Sa’da governorate, approximately 20-25 kilometres from the border with Saudi Arabia. According to locals interviewed by Amnesty International, the area is separated from the frontlines by a few kilometres and during the heavy fighting, they hear the sound of incoming and outgoing ground-launched attacks. <br /> The victim said the bomblets were green and shaped like “a small ball that you play with.” This description is consistent with the US-made BLU-63 cluster bomb submunitions.</p><p>“I saw the bomb [submunition] close to where we were filling water and as I was walking along I saw it [on the ground]. I picked it up and I threw it [to the side] and it exploded. I got hurt and then my brother went to get help…” He was hospitalized for two months and had an operation on his abdomen. He told Amnesty International that there are still submunitions next to the spring.<br /> On 1 March, “Walid” (children’s names have been changed for their security) another 11-year-old from a nearby area, was also hurt by a submunition, losing three of his fingers and breaking his jaw. His brother, “Samih,” an eight year old, was killed.</p><p>[…]</p><p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/yemen-children-among-civilians-killed-and-maimed-in-cluster-bomb-minefields/">https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/yemen-children-among-civilians-killed-and-maimed-in-cluster-bomb-minefields/</a> (with images) = <a href="https://twitter.com/AhmadAlgohbary/status/735144227361935360">https://twitter.com/AhmadAlgohbary/status/735144227361935360</a> and in short by AFP: <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2016/May-23/353366-amnesty-warns-yemen-civilians-face-cluster-bombs-minefields.ashx">http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2016/May-23/353366-amnesty-warns-yemen-civilians-face-cluster-bombs-minefields.ashx</a> and by Middle East Eye: <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/amnesty-warns-yemen-civilians-face-cluster-bomb-minefields-22893700">http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/amnesty-warns-yemen-civilians-face-cluster-bomb-minefields-22893700</a> and film:</p><p><strong>23.5.2016 – Amnesty International on Youtube (** B H K)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen: Cluster munitions</strong></p><p>Children and their families returning home in northern Yemen after a year of conflict are at grave risk of serious injury and death from thousands of unexploded cluster bomb submunitions, Amnesty International said, following a 10-day research trip to Sa’da, Hajjah, and Sana’a governorates.<br /> International assistance is urgently needed to clear contaminated areas and countries with influence should urge the Saudi Arabia-led coalition forces to stop using cluster munitions, which are internationally banned and inherently indiscriminate</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUwmvAG4neQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUwmvAG4neQ</a> see also images <a href="https://twitter.com/AhmadAlgohbary/status/735144227361935360">https://twitter.com/AhmadAlgohbary/status/735144227361935360</a></p><p>For what the use of cluster bombs in Yemen does mean, read: The Vietnam War is still killing people: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-vietnam-war-is-still-killing-people">http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-vietnam-war-is-still-killing-people</a> and</p><p>Comment: It's not off topic.

APPROACH TO COUNTERINSURGENCY IN YEMEN</strong></p><p>One unintended consequence of the Yemeni civil war was the expansion of AQAP influence over the past year. How is the war against AQAP being fought?</p><p>Questions remain. Can tactical victories can be converted into long-term remission of the terrorist organization?</p><p class="selectionshareable"><strong>The Target: AQAP’s Mini-State in Yemen</strong></p><p class="selectionshareable"><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/understanding-yemens-al-qaeda-threat/">AQAP has deep roots in southern Yemen</a>, particularly the provinces of Aden, Abyan, and Shabwa, which encompass most of the territory between the port cities of Aden and Mukalla.</p><p><strong>Clearing AQAP’s Militias out of Southern Cities</strong></p><p>Destroying AQAP was clearly not the main aim in the Arab coalition’s intervention in Yemen — the priority was to prevent a Houthi military victory over the Hadi government — but the coalition did launch its anti-AQAP campaign at the earliest moment possible when the anti-Houthi war settled into a lull in February 2016 in anticipation of peace talks. In particular, the United Arab Emirates took responsibility for disrupting AQAP’s unsettling growth in Aden’s neighborhoods, ports, and universities, in effect vouchsafing the seat of Hadi’s government. Denying AQAP’s lucrative control of Mukalla’s ports and related oilfields was a second aim.</p><p>According to interviews I conducted with contacts in Yemen, the coalition worked from April 2015 onward to build a large force (eventually boasting 12,000 men) to undertake the liberation of Mukalla and the oilfields in Masila. This included courting the generals leading the 1st and 2nd <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/19/world/meast/yemen-military/">Military Regional Commands (MRCs)</a> in northern Hadramaut and Mukalla, which netted 6,500 Yemeni troops in need of ammunition but otherwise combat-ready. The coalition also armed the 1,500-strong Hadramaut Tribal Confederation (HTC), a rural tribal force.</p><p class="selectionshareable"><strong>Find, Fix, and Finish?</strong></p><p class="selectionshareable">The “find and fix” aspect of the intelligence war remains appropriately shrouded in secrecy, but it appears that the process used against AQAP in Yemen is both effective and worthy of future study. The coalition has <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/56742/uae-saudi-arabia-operating-chinese-uavs-over-yemen">significant organic intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets</a> dedicated to the anti-AQAP effort. In addition to helicopters and turboprop surveillance aircraft, the coalition executes numerous daily sorties using fixed-wing forward air controllers using advanced optical pods and ground-search radar, and it also deploys a number of types of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of operating 200 to 250 kilometers from their ground control stations. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-yemen-exclusive-idUSKBN0N129W20150411">U.S. and international signals intelligence and other remote sensing</a> is likely to be shared with the coalition as well. But aside from these technical intelligence collection assets, my conversations with contacts in the Gulf suggest the coalition routinely develops granular human intelligence to complement technical intelligence.</p><p class="selectionshareable">In addition to dislodging AQAP-backed forces from key towns, ports, oilfields, and roads, the coalition claims to have killed 450 enemy troops in Mukalla, 120 in Aden, and 220 in other operations along the southern coast between February and May 2016. <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/05/aqap-says-it-withdrew-from-mukalla-to-protect-residents.php">AQAP claims to have dispersed its forces</a> without suffering much damage, and many indications exist that intact AQAP cadres escaped from Aden and Mukalla to rally in nearby rural redoubts. Even if AQAP did slip away, and even if coalition casualty estimates are halved or quartered, the key point is that AQAP tried and failed to defend Mukalla, thereby losing the prestige and riches of controlling major ports and oilfields.</p><p class="selectionshareable"><strong>Holding and Building Better than AQAP</strong></p><p class="selectionshareable">Disrupting AQAP’s ability to openly control areas of Aden or Mukalla are worthy achievements, but such operations cannot permanently clear these areas of the enemy. The Yemeni government will only be able to reduce AQAP’s ability to recruit tribesmen and operate freely if local people see the government as a more powerful, beneficial partner. Continuing on from clearance operations, the next challenges will be to hold liberated areas and to build new alliances and infrastructure for basic services.</p><p><strong>Can the Arab Coalition Seriously Damage AQAP?</strong></p><p>Given AQAP’s resilience and Yemen’s fractiousness, it would clearly be unwise to the group off at this stage.

Aden is not a defacto capital city of Yemen, and never has been. There is one government in Sanaa, with the Houthis in charge of that, and another government in Riyadh, doing the bidding of their masters in Saudi Arabia. They keep sending a few politicians to Aden to try to run the show but they usually have to flee back to KSA after few weeks for protection. The governors and military leaders in Aden have frequently been subject to assassination attempts, and many have succeeded. I don't know whether ITV doesn't know any better, or whether they think we don't know any better and they are trying to fool us. Either way, this is not correct.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154378592338641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154378592338641</a></p><p>23.5.2016 – Hisham Al-Omeisy (A T)</p><p>Victims were simple people whom above everything just looking for a job to secure an income in a currently wrecked economy.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/omeisy/status/734729670206296069">https://twitter.com/omeisy/status/734729670206296069</a></p><p>23.5.2016 – Nasser Arrabyee (A T)</p><p>Yemen ISIS Identified the suicide bomber who killed more than 100 in Aden south as ABU ALI AL ADANI</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/narrabyee/status/734681335697158144">https://twitter.com/narrabyee/status/734681335697158144</a></p><p>23.5.2016 – Nasser Arrabyee (A T)</p><p>Yemen ISIS Claimed two bombings that killed more than 100 of Saudi occupation forces in the restive Aden south where</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/narrabyee/status/734673614960754688">https://twitter.com/narrabyee/status/734673614960754688</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/omeisy/status/734669166460817408">https://twitter.com/omeisy/status/734669166460817408</a></p><p>23.5.2016 – Hisham Al-Omeisy (A T)</p><p>Death count in Aden suicide blasts now 49.

What do they mean by being bullied?</p><p><strong>Omari:</strong> Well they are being asked the impossible which is to drop their weapons and in Yemen it is hard to drop your weapon when you do not know who is your enemy and your friend.</p><p>There was a time when Ali Abdullah Saleh himself attacked the Houthis, about six wars, if I am not mistaken, that were waged by Ali Abdullah Saleh against the Houthis.

It has helped the Saudis to present their aggressive and unnecessary military intervention in Yemen as a “defensive” measure, and it has obscured the fact that they and their allies are the ones doing the most to destabilize the region.

In fact, in the contemporary Middle East, they’ve become the strangest of bedfellows.</p><p>Rumors about the budding relationship have been circulating for the past few years. In 2015, former Saudi and Israeli officials <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/06/israeli-saudi-relations/395015/">confirmed</a> that they’d held a series of high-level meetings to discuss shared concerns, such as the growing influence of Iran in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon, as well as Iran’s nuclear enrichment program. Shimon Shapira, an Israeli representative who participated in secret meetings with the Saudis, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-06-04/israelis-and-saudis-reveal-secret-talks-to-thwart-iran">put it this way</a>: “We discovered we have the same problems and same challenges and some of the same answers.”</p><p>On May 5, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal and retired Israeli Major General Yaakov Amidror spoke together at a Washington event hosted by <a href="http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/washington_institute_for_near_east_policy">The Washington Institute for Near East Policy</a> — the policy wing of the pro-Israel lobby <a href="http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/american_israel_public_affairs_committee">AIPAC</a>. The event, <a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/a-conversation-on-security-and-peace-in-the-middle-east">broadcast live online</a>, showed that Saudi Arabia and Israel have finally come out of the closet –– together.</p><p>Here are some traits Saudi Arabia and Israel have in common.</p><p>Finally, both countries are long-time allies of the United States. Subsequent U.S. administrations have supported Israel since its founding in 1948; they’ve also supported an array of Saudi kings since the founding of that nation in 1932.</p><p>The U.S. has helped guarantee the security of both nations.

Heading the discussion was F. Gregory Gause, an AGSIW board member and professor of international affairs.</p><p>“It is extremely useful to have a good working relationship with countries that actually govern their territory and that have some influence in areas where real governance no longer exists,” Gause says, adding that the Saudis “are susceptible to the normal instruments of diplomacy and have influence in these areas where governance has collapsed or is contested in the region.”</p><p>Gause asserts that there are still a significant number of common interests that unite Washington and Riyadh. Both sides see Salafi jihadism as a threat and both have an interest in preventing any other power from dominating the Gulf region and the Middle East as a whole.</p><p>Yemen in particular illustrates the strategic differences and commonalities between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. As Gause says, “Yemen encapsulates both the tensions in bilateral relations and the desire by both sides to sustain the relationship despite these tensions.”</p><p>Saudi Arabia is often charged with exporting the exact Salafi jihadist ideology that the U.S. is committed to defeating, but Gause explains that this strain of Islamic extremism is not a purely Saudi phenomenon.</p><p>He rejects the claim made by Senator Chris Murphy (who introduced legislation to increase oversight of U.S. weapon sales to Saudi Arabia) that the kingdom is only a few degrees removed from terrorists inspired by the ISIS ideology. Gause says that if the Saudis did ever have ideological or political control over Salafism in the past, it has since lost it.</p><p>If arm sales were halted, Saudis could easily purchase them elsewhere, and if the intelligence relationship was cut off, it would only serve to harm American interests.</p><p>“It’s hard for me to avoid the conclusion that the talk of distancing ourselves from Riyadh has no practical benefit and is simply an emotional reaction. But foreign policy isn’t simply about feeling good about ourselves, it’s about furthering our country’s interests, and having a decent relationship with Saudi Arabia advances those interests.”</p><p><a href="http://www.yemenpeaceproject.org/blogpost/what-benefits-remain-in-the-u-s-saudi-alliance/">http://www.yemenpeaceproject.org/blogpost/what-benefits-remain-in-the-u-s-saudi-alliance/</a></p><p>Comment: The normal US pro-Saudi argumentation.
