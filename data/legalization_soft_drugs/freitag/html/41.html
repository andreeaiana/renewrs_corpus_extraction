This has made the war’s continuation “criminal” while also chalking up a win for Tehran. </p><p>In his conversation with Sana’a Center staff, Al-Iryani also discusses how southern Yemen marches to its own drum and why the recent Riyadh Agreement is a “powder keg” waiting to blow. He then speaks to how the UAE has behaved like a “kid in a candy shop” in Yemen, lavishing aid and favors upon Salafis who could easily become the next support base for anyone from the Islah party to Al-Qaeda.</p><p><em>Sana’a Center: Why is Yemen at war?</em></p><p>Abdulghani Al-Iryani: Yemenis do not agree on the root cause of conflict, so I can only give you my take on why Yemenis are fighting. The way I see it, this is just one more cycle of competition between northern Zaidi tribal elites and the rest of Yemen over power. This has been a cyclical social negotiation process surfacing throughout the country’s history</p><p><span>In effect, today, the Houthis have reconstituted Saleh’s regime without Saleh. They took control of state institutions, established alliances with tribal sheikhs and co-opted what is left of the GPC and their power arrangements. So, in short, while on the face of it this conflict is political, at its root it is an identity conflict, with these demographic blocks competing, fighting or making alliances.</span></p><p><span>The south of Yemen has not really been part of this process of social negotiation. That’s why the south tends to behave in its own way – not quite consistent with the central dynamic of the Yemen conflict. In essence, the conflict in the south is even more identity-based – between what is referred to as the “Bedouins,” represented by President Hadi and his allies, and those Tribesmen represented by the Southern Transitional Council (STC). </span></p><p><span>Then the regional dimension comes in.</span></p><p>It was clear that one of the main reasons behind the war in Yemen was related to a Saudi internal affair and when this domestic justification ceased to exist, MBS did not have the time to stop it. Then other things [came into the picture] like the economy of the war. There’s also a wing in Saudi Arabia which to this day is still thinking about [annexing] Hadramawt and Mahra or getting extraterritorial rights in them. Saudi Arabia only put up a serious effort at winning the war until 2016 when the Kuwait peace negotiations started. When these negotiations failed, serious Saudi effort at winning the war was never resumed.</p><p><em>What is the current status of peace negotiations? </em></p><p>AA: The UN is now pursuing further negotiations, mostly in connection with the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement. But we have to accept the fact that the UN is a tool: the UN will not make peace, Yemenis will make peace. If the parties are serious about advancing towards peace, then the UN is a useful tool to work out areas of interest for negotiation. If one side is not interested in peace, then no matter how smart the special envoy is, the UN can do nothing. No one can force a peace agreement on anyone. </p><p>I think we’re now at a point where peace would actually be feasible to pursue. The obstacles that stood in the way of peace are falling one by one. The war economy was one of the key obstacles, but over the past few months, maybe a year, the income from it has been going down. </p><p>I think the face-saving exit is not going to happen on the battlefield – Saudi Arabia has demonstrated incompetence over and over again. The only way is the political way – some kind of political production to give them a face-saving exit. Without that I think they will keep the conflict going – maybe even increase its intensity, leading to a lot more bloodshed. But there is no way that they can change the outcome – they have shown that they are unable to beat the Houthis militarily.</p><p><em>Which party currently has the upper hand in the war?</em></p><p>AA: I think the Houthis, and by association Iran, have won the war, and their victory is irreversible. Some will disagree but I say that because of the following: They are in full control of Yemeni state institutions. They have reconstituted a political elite deal that has governed Yemen for decades. They control the majority of the population. They are in a position to speak for the people of Yemen, while the internationally recognized government has been displaced and losing credibility over the years. They are now the voice of the northern Zaidi demographic and people turn to them to maintain their interests.</p><p>So we have one side that controls the Yemeni state and another side that is unable to implement anything. The internationally recognized government has lost its base in the south and been unable to build institutions to compete with those controlled by the Houthis. It has lost credibility in the eyes of the population, who see the government as a willing participant in the weaponizing of the economy against the population. The government is blamed for not opening Sana’a airport. It is blamed for obstacles placed on the import of petroleum products, food and basic commodities. It is blamed for having transferred the central bank to Aden and promising to pay salaries for all [public sector employees], then not paying salaries. So, the general population will give them no legitimacy. Now the government’s legitimacy comes from the UN Security Council, then the UN Security Council can take it away at any time – and the government will have nothing left. </p><p>So now that the Houthis have won, the continuation of war is not only unconscionable but also criminal. On Hadi’s side, there are a lot of people who know that their careers will end with the end of the war.</p><p>Unfortunately, the course of negotiation the special envoy is now pursuing is going to lead to a dead end. I think he, and really all of us, should start thinking of a new modality that is implementable. We need to recognize that the most we can get out of negotiations is to freeze and formalize the existing state of affairs so that every party controls and manages areas and population they are currently controlling. We need to formalize that control, foster coordination between these different groups so that the national institutions that have been divided into two or three pieces can be restored. </p><p><em>Do the parties trust the UN?</em></p><p>AA: The Houthis do not trust the UN. </p><p>The internationally recognized government, on the other hand, has only the UN to give it legitimacy – so of course, they trust the UN. They know the UN is doing its best to help them return to Sana’a. Saudi Arabia can exercise undue influence on what the UN does for a variety of reasons. It has excellent relations with permanent members of the UNSC. It also has various points of leverage: if it wants to harass the UN, it can withhold licenses for UN flights to Sana’a, for example. It can refuse to finance the special mission and other UN activities. There are many ways Saudi Arabia can make life for the UN difficult. These tools are not available to the other side. So the UN is not neutral in this conflict – it cannot be for very pragmatic reasons.</p><p><em>You referred there to UN Security Council Resolution 2216 </em>–<em> adopted in 2015 </em>–<em> which essentially enshrines the legitimacy of the Hadi government. Does the resolution still have a role to play?</em></p><p>AA: Resolution 2216 was issued after the Houthis took control of Sana’a. Its purpose was to deter them, force them to back down following the coup and make them return to the political process. It did not achieve this desired purpose and after a few months it lost its utility, so there is a need for a new, more balanced and more realistic resolution to deal with the Houthis.</p><p>Since then and until this day, Resolution 2216 was negatively used. The Saudis used it to prolong the war. When the international community pressured Saudi Arabia to stop the war, it would say “we are ready [to do so], but the Houthis must implement Resolution 2216,” i.e. withdraw from Sana’a, hand over weapons and return to Sa’ada, then agreements can then be reached.</p><p>These impossible conditions were [applied] and used to prolong the war for years. Despite that, the main beneficiary from Resolution 2216 was the most competent party: the Houthis. Resolution 2216’s validity ended four years ago, and the international community is still thinking of issuing a new resolution. Look, it’s true that the [UN special] envoy has a role but, in the end, the Americans and British decide everything. They make the decisions with their eye on Saudi Arabia. They decide on [the] condition [that] they do not upset Saudi Arabia. And in the end, Saudi desire is what directs international decisions pertaining to Yemen. Meaning, no one is willing to make a decision that may cause Boeing to lose a $20 billion deal to Airbus.</p><p><em>Tell us more about Islah. What is it? </em></p><p>AA: Look, Islah is a tribe before it’s anything else – it was a Zaidi tribe. Notice how all of Islah’s main leaders have Zaidi origins and a Zaidi identity – the identity which I call the northern Zaidi tribal identity. Zaidiyyah as a [social] identity and not a [religious] sect. The aim of the uprising in 2011 was to end the northern Zaidi tribal monopoly of power. They [Islah] came and hijacked this revolution, and they were practically trying to turn the matter into [a question of] who will replace Ali Abdullah Saleh. [For Islah] this was to be Hamid al-Ahmar [a senior Islah MP, powerful businessman and sheikh from the highly influential Hashid tribal federation], recycling the northern tribal elite instead of including the rest of the society.</p><p>This is why they lost their popular base, and the people, whether the Zaidi street or the rest of Yemen, viewed them as [hijackers] who are removing Ali Abdullah Saleh’s regime and replacing it with the ugly side of Ali Abdullah Saleh’s regime. </p><p><em>Is there a sense of identity-driven hatred in Yemen? </em></p><p>AA: Divisions are identity-based and politically expressed, but this is not hatred. The divisions are based on interests rather than animosity. </p><p><em>What about the relationship between Iran and the Houthis? How do we square this with the Saudi-Houthi talks?</em></p><p>AA: Iran sends the Houthis regular shipments of petroleum products – the estimated value of that is maybe $200-250 million a year. But this is only a small contribution to the Houthis’ total revenue. Iran also gives the Houthis political advice, military training, and there are at least 5,000 students studying in Iran at any one time. We know they occasionally send missile parts or missiles – but the type of weaponry they use is actually available on the black market. If Iran doesn’t want to get implicated then they don’t need to send missiles. One of the members of the Houthi cabinet is a famous arms dealer named on a UN list – he has the network to provide weapons from anywhere in the world. </p><p>The ideological link is very difficult to estimate but it is there. There is co-dependence and mutual interest. The Houthis are not proxy of Iran or a pawn – they have their own agenda. They are a local force with a local agenda. They are allied with Iran but not subject to its influence the way that is advertised. Iran does not actually have the kind of leverage over the Houthis that everyone talks about.</p><p><span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9246">https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9246</a></span></p><p>My comment: A very long and interesting interview, dealing with very many subjects.</p><p>and</p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Ending the war in Yemen: Q&amp;A with Abdulghani al-Iryani</strong></p><p>To better understand why and whether there is a way for the war to end, the <em>Global Observatory</em> spoke with Abdulghani al-Iryani, a senior researcher at the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, where he focuses on the peace process, conflict analysis, and transformations of the Yemeni state</p><p>Mr. Al-Iryani: We have basically come towards the end of the conflict, and the question should be “why is it still going?” It is continuing for two reasons mostly. One is the war economy. People from all sides are making lots of money out of this conflict, including some front-line officials of the Arab Coalition. They have no interest in bringing this conflict to an end.</p><p>The second reason is because the Saudis and the Houthis—Ansar Allah—have not been able to come to an agreement on the kind of long-term relationship they should have.</p><p>Clearly, none of the stated goals of the international armed coalition at the beginning of the conflict have been achieved. On the one hand, Ansar Allah has been able to withstand all the pressure and take over the state institutions. On the other hand, the internationally-recognized government has been able to make itself irrelevant both by its incompetence, corruption, and by its inability to respond to the needs of its people.</p><p>In this context it is hard for me to see the benefit or purpose of renewed sanctions, which usually affect the population more than they do those who control the population. In my view, it is useless. It serves no apparent interest if that interest is to bring this war to an end.</p><p>For the Saudis, clearly they are fully involved. They are actually fighting and I think that, while they were interested in ending the conflict early on, since the failure of the Kuwait negotiations and peace talks in 2016, they have kept the war at a low level and made no effort to bring it to an end. In the meantime, they have used it to mobilize and agitate against Iran. Of course, Ansar Allah were the main beneficiary of this strategy.</p><p>As far as Iran is concerned, I think their role in Yemen is very limited. It was very limited in the beginning, and it remains limited now. But as the conflict continues, Ansar Allah is being pushed against their will to the side of the Iranians because of their need for new defense technology.</p><p>Ansar Allah has made an effort to stay away from Iran because they realize that their long-term interest is in having good relations with Saudi Arabia. They come from a part of Yemen which has always been connected to the Saudi economy. All their produce was sold in Saudi Arabia, all the imports that came to them came from Saudi Arabia. The currency of trade in their areas is the Saudi riyal not the Yemeni riyal. Their social relations are more connected to the Saudi side than they are to the Yemeni side.</p><p>A normal situation for Ansar Allah and Saudi Arabia is good neighborly relations. This situation of antagonism is an aberration. I think they both realize that they need to work out a cooperative relationship. As long they don’t, Iran benefits. Iran did not actively seek to establish a foothold in Yemen. It was the mismanagement of the Saada conflict from 2004 onwards that gave Iran that foothold with minimum investment on their part.</p><p>The Stockholm Agreement is an entry point to a larger national ceasefire and return to peace. It would be useful for all the articles of the Stockholm Agreement to be implemented, but it is not necessary.</p><p>I think both the Saudis and the Ansar Allah know exactly how this needs to be done. They are talking, and when they started talking they told the United Nations they do not need any help.</p><p>One obstacle that stands in the way is that the Saudis are still clinging to the objective of bringing [President Abdrabbuh Mansur] Hadi back to Sana’a. It is clear that this is not going to happen and the Saudis are hesitant to appear as if they have failed to achieve their objectives. They need a face-saving exit, one where they agree with the Ansar Allah in a way that makes them look better.</p><p>Another factor is that Ansar Allah is factionalized. There is a militant faction that would not like to see this war come to an end. </p><p><span><a href="https://theglobalobservatory.org/2020/03/ending-war-yemen-qa-abdulghani-al-iryani/">https://theglobalobservatory.org/2020/03/ending-war-yemen-qa-abdulghani-al-iryani/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>Film: Inside Yemen's dangerously divided 'city of snipers</strong></p><p>Taiz, in Yemen's south-west, is home to one of the longest-running battles of the country's civil war.</p><p>Known as the city of snipers, Taiz - divided between the Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the government - is constantly under siege.</p><p>Saudi air-strikes have continued since the start of the war in 2015 and the people of Taiz say they feel forgotten.</p><p>The BBC gained exclusive access to see what life is like for those living on the government controlled side of this divided city</p><p><span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-51806821/inside-yemen-s-dangerously-divided-city-of-snipers">https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-51806821/inside-yemen-s-dangerously-divided-city-of-snipers</a></span><span> = <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live/video/20200311104034-inside-yemens-dangerous-city-of-snipers/">https://www.cbsnews.com/live/video/20200311104034-inside-yemens-dangerous-city-of-snipers/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>‘Mutual Extortion Racket:’ How Defense Manufacturers Influence US Foreign Policy</strong></p><p>As the humanitarian toll [in the Yemen war] continues to climb, the administration of President Donald Trump has faced growing pressure to end U.S. support for the war.</p><p>In a historic vote in April 2019, the U.S. Congress passed a <a href="https://theglobepost.com/2019/04/04/final-yemen-resolution-vote/">War Powers Resolution</a> directing Trump to end U.S. involvement in the conflict. Three months later, lawmakers passed a<a href="https://theglobepost.com/2019/07/17/congress-saudi-arms-sales-2/"> series of resolutions</a> blocking arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p><p>But both measures faced <a href="https://theglobepost.com/2019/12/10/yemen-ndaa-compromise/">staunch opposition</a> from the American defense manufacturing industry, which stood to lose billions of dollars if Washington cut support to the coalition. The resolutions were ultimately vetoed by Trump and both override efforts failed in the Senate.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://ti-defence.org/publications/a-mutual-extortion-racket-the-military-industrial-complex-and-us-foreign-policy-the-cases-of-saudi-arabia-uae/">report</a> titled “A Mutual Extortion Racket: The Military Industrial Complex and U.S. Foreign Policy – The Case of Saudi Arabia and UAE,” Transparency International’s Jodi Vittori documents how the American defense manufacturing industry has been able to exert influence on U.S. foreign policy decisions, particularity on Yemen.</p><p>As the war grinds on, The Globe Post’s Bryan Bowman spoke with Vittori about the many “pathways to influence” used by the defense industry to ensure its ability to continue to export arms to the coalition, even in the face of significant bipartisan opposition.</p><p>Vittori: I often see people look at how the defense industry, through lobbyists, PR firms and so forth, influences Congress and it’s a one way arrow. And that’s not really the case. That’s especially not the case when we deal with the defense industry as a defense export industry in particular, which is a very unique sector, I think, in the American economy. So I really wanted to take what he worked with, but really expand on it for this unique sector.</p><p>Bowman: In the executive summary, you write the report “examines how the US defense industry uses a combination of pathways to influence the American federal government to ensure the ability to export to countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).” What are those pathways of influence and what are a couple of examples of how they’ve been used in recent years? </p><p>Vittori: Absolutely. So this is a somewhat different project for transparency than normal, because we usually were focused very, very narrowly on corruption as focused on illegality.</p><p>So we looked at corruption. But we also looked at other defense pathways that can pull U.S. foreign policy as it relates to arms exports away from what one could argue is in the best interests of U.S. foreign policy and international peace overall. </p><p>One of them, of course, is lobbying. Elections are incredibly expensive in the United States, as we’re watching as we go through the presidential and congressional elections. It takes a lot of campaign donations to be able to run for office</p><p>It’s very, very difficult to track dark money.</p><p>Then we looked at the revolving door, and this is based off the incredible work that the <span><a href="https://thedefensepost.com/2018/11/23/us-military-spending-solve-problems-dan-grazier-interview/">Project on Government Oversight</a></span> has done. We often focus on a revolving door with members of Congress and their staffs. And this has been extensively studied. There’s a lot of very strong empirical evidence that supports the fact that staffers are primarily hired for their access and less for the information expertise that they provide. </p><p>That’s just as true in the defense industry, but often neglected, as is the role that senior military officers and senior Department of Defense and State Department officials can play in the revolving door and how loose those rules are. </p><p>Just as an example, General [James] Mattis was on the board of General Dynamics. He left the board and became the secretary of defense and is now already back on the board.</p><p>This whole senior officers running senior defense firm stuff, this is a relatively recent situation. And it can have tremendous impacts both on the defense establishment and, frankly, the morale of the younger troops underneath them if those troops are concerned that those officers are looking out more for their future careers and less about getting them the best equipment and services that they need to do their missions.</p><p>Then we also note the lack of controls for former military officers and others to go work for foreign countries. That’s less common but it does happen.</p><p>Bowman: You note in the report that “few recent cases exemplify this cycle as clearly as the war in Yemen,” which is causing what the U.N. deems the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. How specifically has the US defense export sector sought to influence the government to maintain its support for the Saudi coalition fighting there, even in the face of mounting opposition within Congress and growing pressure from the international community to end the war? </p><p>Vittori: Certainly. It basically runs the gamut across all of the pathways of influence. We noted, obviously, significant lobbying of both Republicans and Democrats to maintain those defense exports going forward. And campaign finance goes with it. </p><p>And then there’s the revolving door jobs. I’ll just pick on Secretary Mattis again. When he was secretary, he was writing to Senators and Congressmen, saying don’t restrict our ability to export these weapons. I have no indications of what he’s done since he’s gone back on General Dynamic’s board. But I’m sure they’re quite pleased that somebody supported continued UAE exports on their board.</p><p>Then there’s soft influence. We document a number of cases, for example, with defense advisory boards and even think tanks. There was a a leak of the UAE ambassador’s emails that documented a lot of things, including some questionable offsets given by U.S. companies that filter back in the U.S. to influence drone exports, for example. And also just significant money given to think tanks that helped support, for example, drone exports as well. Those think tanks argue that they were not engaged in lobbying. But they did things like set up roundtables with defense experts that could potentially help influence U.S. foreign policy on those issues. </p><p>So it’s not just one thing, and that’s what the empirical evidence shows as well. It’s not just lobbying or just revolving door. When all of these work together in concert they are far more effective. </p><p>But defense industry lobbyists often go to members of Congress and talk about how many jobs are in their districts. I was able to interview a defense analyst who wishes to remain anonymous and he made it very clear that when they are lobbying Congress, their goal is to focus just on jobs and not focus on the larger foreign policy concerns. They keep the conversation very, very narrow, because often there are very, very large foreign policy concerns with defense exports – future blowback, diversion of goods, and so forth.</p><p>In terms of Yemen and the exports to the UAE and Yemen, there are a lot of reasons countries decide to import weapons from a country like the U.S. One is national security. But believe it or not, that is often not the main reason. A primary reason might be to remain under the security blanket of a key ally. So a lot of the reason that Saudi Arabia and the UAE purchased weapons over the years is that they’re very weak countries. And this helps keep them under the U.S. security umbrella. </p><p>And it also allows for regime survival.</p><p>One of the reasons that the United States was always happy to sell, frankly, was they never thought Saudi Arabia was really going to use most of the stuff. It was fairly safe. They were going to buy lots of stuff and make lots of American jobs. It was an easy export. Make lots of money. Keep the security umbrella going. Everybody was happy. But lo and behold, in Yemen they start using the stuff. And I don’t think the United States foreign policy world was really expecting that – by Bryan Bowman</p><p><span><a href="https://theglobepost.com/2020/03/09/yemen-military-industrial-complex/">https://theglobepost.com/2020/03/09/yemen-military-industrial-complex/</a></span></p><p>and here is the full report:</p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>A Mutual Extortion Racket: The Military Industrial Complex and US Foreign Policy – The Cases of Saudi Arabia &amp; UAE</strong></p><p>Defence industry players, elected officials, the defence bureaucracy, and governments in the Middle East are intertwined and serve one another’s interest, often at the expense of US foreign policy outcomes. These mutually-beneficial relationships have contributed to a vicious cycle of conflict and human rights abuses across the Middle East and North Africa, including increased exports of arms and defence services to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates which began under the Obama administration and have ramped up under President Trump.</p><p><span><a href="https://ti-defence.org/publications/a-mutual-extortion-racket-the-military-industrial-complex-and-us-foreign-policy-the-cases-of-saudi-arabia-uae/">https://ti-defence.org/publications/a-mutual-extortion-racket-the-military-industrial-complex-and-us-foreign-policy-the-cases-of-saudi-arabia-uae/</a></span></p><p>From the Executive Summary</p><p>This report examines the underlying processes and pathways to influence between the American defense export sector, the federal government, the defense bureaucracy, and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) governments. These pathways enable American defense firms to export arms and defense services to MENA countries despite many regimes’ poor human rights and governance records, lack of transparency and accountability, and questionable outcomes for US foreign policy. This not only often leads to poor outcomes for American national security and foreign policy, but it is also harms international peace by helping to fuel conflict and human rights abuses in the MENA region.</p><p>This report specifically examines how the US defense industry uses a combination of pathways to influence the American federal government to ensure the ability to export to countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), despite growing concerns both of their repressive regimes and their increasingly aggressive foreign policies, specifically their involvement in the civil war in Yemen. To illustrate these pathways of influence, this report provides examples such as key lobbying firms associated with a former member of the House Armed Services Committee and lobbyists with the Trump presidential campaign. It will assess how some recently retired senior military officers now work for the defense industry in MENA-related lobbying jobs, and even one case where a former Army officer joined the Emirati military, leading their helicopter forces there. This report will include examples such as the UAE’s role in using an American private security company as a possible intermediary to push for policy change vis-à-vis US foreign policy with Qatar and Saudi Arabia’s aggressive lobbying to limit censure for conduct in the conflict in Yemen.</p><p>Beyond the sheer size of the sector, American defense export companies exhibit unique characteristics that make this economic sector especially important for scrutiny. First, the sector provides vital equipment and services to the United States and those of MENA regimes essential to their national security; without these goods and services, the United States would lack the military pillar of American foreign policy. American defense goods exported to MENA regimes are often key aspects of their own internal security as well as placing them firmly under the American defense umbrella against their external enemies. The fact that key defense components such as fighter aircraft and naval ships are often produced by one or a few firms, along with the significant control exercised by the United States federal government as the primary customer for most defense goods and its role in approving nearly all defense exports means that the defense sector and US government are intertwined in ways not exhibited in other export sectors.</p><p>The MENA region is an especially important export customer for American defense firms. MENA is considered one of the most militarized regions in the world, with six out of the ten top ten defense budgets as a percentage of GDP found there.</p><p>This report documents how these unique characteristics of the US defense export sector are intertwined with key pathways for influence vis-à-vis the US federal government in order for the defense export sector to ensure a relatively open legislative and regulatory environment to continue to export to the Middle East. Rarely is only one pathway used for influence by the defense sector; they are often intermingled to magnify influence towards desired policy outcomes. The pathways analyzed here are:</p><p>Lobbying. Lobbying is any oral or written communication to influence executive and legislative branch officials on behalf of a client to formulate, modify, or adopt certain legislation, regulations, or policies of the US government. The defense sector runs extensive in-house lobbying activities as well as hiring outside lobbying firms, public relations firms, and consultants in order to help influence the US federal government towards defense export-friendly policies.</p><p>Campaign Finance. Running for and staying in office is exceptionally expensive, and the defense industry is able to make significant campaign contributions, especially for elected officials on important Congressional committees or representing key defense firms in their districts. The role of so-called “dark money,” where money is donated theoretically separate from individual political campaigns by anonymous donors, including those in the defense sector, are especially pernicious. As a result, the US defense export sector is able to use its campaign contributions to not only ensure a relatively benign export environment, but perhaps more importantly, to prevent significant reforms unfavorable to the industry, for while there may be only one way to pass a Congressional bill, there are many ways to kill an unfavorable one.</p><p>Revolving Door. This refers to high-level government employees, including members of Congress and their staffs, senior military personnel, and other members of the executive branch rotating to senior jobs in industry or lobbying-associated activities. It can also refer to industry leaders rotating into senior governmental jobs, usually on a relatively short-term basis of a few years, where they have the potential to make decisions that can affect their companies’ interests. Empirical studies demonstrate that it is often access to government officials and insider knowledge rather than expertise in a particular policy arena that leads to these hiring decisions.</p><p>This is especially common in national security-related work: the Project on Government Oversight found that in 2018 alone, there were at least 645 instances where the top 20 defense contractors hired former government officials, military officers, members of Congress, and senior legislative staff to be lobbyists, board members, or senior executives.</p><p>Defense Offsets. These are provisions in foreign government defense procurement contracts that promise specific benefits to the contracting country as a condition for purchasing defense goods and services from a non-domestic supplier such as an American defense firm; in short, they are side deals and sweeteners for countries who purchase American defense goods. US defense contractors typically enter into an average of 30 to 60 offset agreements representing $3 to $7 billion in obligations each year. These contracts are a notorious conduit for corruption. Saudi Arabia and the UAE require defense offset contracts as part of defense deals, while keeping both the deals themselves and the beneficial owners of the firms associated with them secret. Thus, defense offset deals in these countries exhibit significant red flags for potentially corrupt activity. One such offset deal funneled cash from American arms contracts to the UAE government who then funneled it through a local think tank to an American one to conduct research and advocacy activities that supported loosening drone exports to the UAE.</p><p>“Soft” Influence. These include defense industry funding of think tanks, media campaigns, and academic work that supports industry policies and goals. These methods of influence are not necessarily bad, but they can reinforce other pathways of influence in ways that benefit the defense industry but can hurt American foreign policy or national security interests. Soft influence includes the influence companies can gain from sitting on various policies boards, such as the Defense Policy Board, which provides advice on long term and enduring issues of defense planning as well as research and analysis on topics assigned by the Defense Secretary or his senior staff. That the board members provide advice on policies that have a direct financial bearing on their companies can be a conflict of interest. In some cases, former senior military leaders, once they left the service, have joined senior positions of defense companies and then also sat on the Defense Policy Board while at the same time enjoying fellowships with leading think tanks, demonstrating the overlapping aspects of the revolving door and soft influence.</p><p>Corruption.</p><p><span><a href="https://ti-defence.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/US_Defense_Industry_Influence_Paper_v4_digital_singlePage.pdf">https://ti-defence.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/US_Defense_Industry_Influence_Paper_v4_digital_singlePage.pdf</a></span></p><p><strong>(** A K)</strong></p><p><strong>US-Marines im Jemen</strong></p><p>Die USA schickt Soldaten in den Jemen: Auf der jemenitischen, von den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten besetzten Insel Sokotra trafen in diesen Tagen weitere US-Militärs ein, Patriot-Raketensysteme sind schon errichtet.</p><p><span>Die jemenitische Nachrichten-Website <a href="https://sanaspostnews.com/2020/03/07/us-marines-reinforce-uae-forces-in-socotra/">sanapostnews.com</a> <a href="https://blog.fdik.org/2020-03/s1583798083">meldet</a>:</span></p><p>„Eine neue Gruppe aus dem Marinekorps der Vereinigten Staaten traf am Samstag auf der Insel Sokotra ein, nachdem die Patriot-Systeme installiert worden waren, wie lokale Quellen berichten.“</p><p><span><a href="http://blauerbote.com/2020/03/10/us-marines-im-jemen/">http://blauerbote.com/2020/03/10/us-marines-im-jemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** A K)</strong></p><p><strong>US marines arrive on Yemen’s Socotra to support UAE forces</strong></p><p>A new batch of US Marines arrived on the Yemeni island of Socotra on Saturday, according to local sources, installing Patriot defence systems.</p><p><span><a href="https://sanaspostnews.com/2020/03/07/us-marines-reinforce-uae-forces-in-socotra/"><em>Sanaa Post</em></a></span> reported that the American soldiers were received by the “<span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20191101-report-uae-still-occupies-9-economic-sites-in-yemen/">occupying</a></span>” UAE forces at their headquarters on the island.</p><p>There is speculation that the US intends to establish its own military base amid reports that America had sent military experts to equip observation points to deploy radars and air defence points on the strategically located island overlooking the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.</p><p>US forces had previously arrived on Socotra in December of last year and <span><a href="http://en.althawranews.net/2019/12/american-forces-begin-to-install-defensive-systems-in-socotra/">reportedly</a></span> started installing a Patriot missile system in order to protect the Saudi and Emirati forces on the island at the time.</p><p>According to the sources, on 21 December of last year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman ordered the UN-recognised, exiled Yemeni government of President <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200304-yemen-hadi-government-calls-on-us-to-designate-houthis-as-terrorists/">Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi</a></span> to lease the entire island to the UAE for a period of about 95 years.

Although the rate of new infections had slowed a year later, the number of suspected cases began to rise again in early 2019.</p><p>The prolonged, consistent nature of new cases over the last 14 months shows the disease is still rampant in Yemen.</p><p>Muhsin Siddiquey, Oxfam’s Yemen Country Director said: “'The outlook is bleak for people in Yemen with cholera continuing at similar levels to last year and the rainy season likely to see thousands more people infected. “This is a health crisis hiding in plain sight. It’s shocking that this ongoing crisis is getting so little attention.</p><p>“A lack of clean water and food has left many people weak and vulnerable to disease, and yet aid agencies are struggling to reach those most in need because of access constraints imposed by all sides.</p><p>“We need urgent action from the international community to ensure safe, secure and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid and to bring the parties together to agree a nationwide ceasefire.”</p><p>The number of deaths from cholera in 2019 dropped to 1025 - less than half the number of fatalities in 2017. But efforts to definitively beat the disease have been massively undermined by the war, which has decimated health, water and sanitation systems.</p><p>Medical supplies are in chronically short supply and only around half the health facilities in Yemen are fully functioning.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/rainy-season-threatens-huge-cholera-spike-yemen-conflict-hampers-efforts-address">https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/rainy-season-threatens-huge-cholera-spike-yemen-conflict-hampers-efforts-address</a></span> = <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/rainy-season-threatens-huge-cholera-spike-yemen">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/rainy-season-threatens-huge-cholera-spike-yemen</a></span></p><p>(* A H)</p><p>Outbreak update – Cholera in Yemen, 29 December 2019</p><p>The Ministry of Public Health and Population of Yemen reported 9153 suspected cases and three associated deaths during epidemiological week 52 (23 – 29 December) of 2019 with 12% of the cases reported as severe.

They are civilians who were arbitrarily taken from homes, streets and public places for their views, political belongings, or their ideological or religious beliefs. While in illegal detention, they have been vulnerable to forcible disappearance in secret detention centers.</p><p>These abductees and forcibly disappeared people are being held by the Houthis armed group in "244" formal prisons and "112" secret detention centers. During the past five-year confinement, detainees suffered brutal physical torture that paralyzed 11 abductees. They live in fear and coercion. They are constantly threatened by death, rape of their children and wives. This caused 20 detainees to suffer psychological and mental disorder.</p><p>71 arbitrary detainees were killed under torture or shot dead in custody with no action taken against perpetrators. 210 detainees were killed by bombing carried out the Saudi-led Coalition's warplanes on Houthis-run prisons and detention centers. These incidents went uninvestigated and no one was held accountable for such wrongdoings.</p><p>Mothers, wives and children to the abductees and arbitrary detainees suffered too much. </p><p>Female relatives to the detainees and abductees were optimistic when parties to the conflict signed the Stockholm agreement. So far, international pressures and efforts led to freedom of scores of civilian detainees. Yet, dozens remain in captivity or in arbitrary disappearance and they urgently need every effort and pressure by the international community to support them obtain their freedoms.</p><p>38 arbitrary disappeared people are being held captive in private detention centers by informal military and security units in Aden since three years ago.

When I found out that I had renal failure, it felt like my life was taken from me, these sessions have given me hope,” says Tamer.</p><p>The process of going through dialysis treatment requires a lifestyle overhaul for most patients.

I couldn’t afford them otherwise,” concluded Tamer.</p><p>In 2019, WHO, with support from King Salman Humanitarian and Relief Center (KSRelief), United Arab Emirates Aid, and Kuwait, managed to provide dialysis supplies to support 21 dialysis centres by 600 000 dialysis sessions in 13 governorates (Amanat Al Asimah, Aden, Taiz, Sana'a, Sa’adah, Ma’rib, Shabowa, Hadramout, Dhamar, Al Bidha, Ibb, Hudaydah, and Al Mahrah) to cover the urgent need of more than 3500 patients requiring life-saving dialysis sessions to ensure continued treatment.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/who-supports-patients-yemen-lifesaving-dialysis-treatment">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/who-supports-patients-yemen-lifesaving-dialysis-treatment</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Addressing gender-based violence and child marriage: a grassroots approach</p><p>In this article I discuss the widespread rise of gender-based violence (GBV) and child marriage since the start of the conflict, and the coping mechanisms Yemeni families are employing to survive – especially the displaced.</p><p>A child with a child</p><p>In my many years of working with vulnerable women I have come across two key issues: early marriage and physical violence. Both are extremely problematic during peacetime, but during a conflict they are dramatically worse, even if data is difficult to obtain.</p><p>Before the conflict the rate of early marriage in Yemen was already very high, with 9% of girls married before the age of 15 and 32% before they reach 18, according to UN figures. Due to a lack of understanding of their own bodies and the physical changes they go through, young girls are especially at risk during pregnancy and childbirth. Many women and girls die during childbirth through loss of blood or because they are malnourished. In 2018 up to 410,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women were admitted to health facilities with acute malnutrition, an increase of 87% since 2016. While the statistics are shocking, the personal stories of the women I meet are even more impactful.</p><p>Aside from protection, a key reason for early marriage is money, particularly in a precarious conflict-affected context in which so many people are looking for any way to make ends meet. Another woman I know married off her 15-year-old daughter to a much older man to access the money to be able to flee from Taiz to Aden. She came to Aden in 2016 with her daughter, but the husband is still in Taiz and is pressuring her to return.</p><p>With early marriage comes protection and income for mothers and fathers – in many ways it is a logical decision. Child marriage is not reported because it is seen as a protection mechanism to guard against a greater threat. The issue is of course cultural, and a lot of families are not educated enough to know that it is not good for their girls. I have seen cases of families marrying their young daughters – and in some cases, young sons – even when they have no need for money or protection.</p><p>Sexual violence and harassment are other serious issues facing the women and girls I meet. There are cases of rape, but they are not reported officially. When I speak with women they say they have been attacked many times, but no one mentions rape. I suspect there are countless cases of very serious sexual violence, but they are not reported because women are afraid of the social stigma attached to rape, and because of ongoing risks to their safety – by Warda Saleh</p><p><span><a href="https://odihpn.org/magazine/yemen-gender-based-violence-child-marriage/">https://odihpn.org/magazine/yemen-gender-based-violence-child-marriage/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Addressing violence against women and girls: the role of national organisations</p><p>Women and girls face particular hardship: the war has exacerbated patriarchal, tribal and religious discrimination, and gender-based violence (GBV) has increased dramatically. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) reports that three million women and girls are at risk of violence. Forced early marriage has increased three-fold. This violence, and the patriarchal norms and attitudes it stems from, further constrains women and girls’ access to services.</p><p>While shocking and deserving of attention, the statistics and stories also obscure the courage and resilience of Yemeni women and girls and the vital work of women-focused and women-led organisations. Recognising the critical role national women’s organisations play, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) sought to listen to and amplify their perspectives and their experiences of responding to the needs of women and girls. Specifically, we wanted to know how these long-standing responders understood the opportunities for and barriers to the delivery of programming for women and girls, and their perceptions of how the international humanitarian community has engaged with national civil society.</p><p>In-depth interviews were conducted with two partners, the Yemen Women’s Union (YWU) and Al Hikma. Established in 1968, the YWU operates across Yemen delivering psychosocial support, health services, shelter and livelihoods opportunities to women and youth. Al Hikma, established in 1990, delivers a multi-sectoral programme including protection and GBV services, alongside shelter, nutrition and health activities. This article also draws on partner and IRC experiences of programming (IRC has been operational in Yemen since 2012, and has provided services for women and girls specifically since 2017).</p><p>Community acceptance</p><p>Reflecting documented trends in Yemen, YWU and Al Hikma stressed the increased burden the conflict has placed on the large number of women and adolescent girls who have become heads of households, and corresponding exposure to risks of GBV for those taking on roles outside the home. Staff from Al Hikma told us that ‘when women access income opportunities instead of men it creates a switch in power and backlash from men which can lead to intimate partner violence … the security situation also impacts on women’s lives. Movement restrictions were part of their reality but it is now exacerbated as men want to protect women from the risks of GBV at checkpoints in order to preserve their honour’. Finally, concerns were raised that the fear of GBV and limited livelihoods opportunities have led to increased rates of depression and suicide among women.</p><p>Evidence from national and international NGO programmes illustrates how the increasing and complex needs of women and girls, and the efforts of NGOs and women’s organisations, have in some sectors resulted in a parallel rise in levels of community acceptance for programming designed to address these needs. </p><p>In contrast to increasing acceptance of general programming for women, and despite clear evidence of rising GBV, community resistance to addressing sensitive topics such as rape, forced marriage of girls and sexual violence remains high.</p><p>In 2017 and 2018 IRC sought to establish women-friendly spaces in three governorates.

Key to successfully responding to these challenges has been the adoption of diversified approaches that build on the idea of the centrality of protection. Additional important features include taking a multi-sector, integrated approach, ensuring that programmes can adapt to the challenges posed by the fluid context, seeking to embed participation and capacity-building to ensure sustainability and fostering positive engagement with local authorities and other stakeholders.</p><p>Context</p><p>Despite humanitarian organisations’ attempts to respond to high levels of acute malnutrition across Yemen, the nutritional status of children under five and pregnant and lactating mothers continues to deteriorate. Displacement by ongoing fighting, the collapse of the healthcare system and a lack of livelihoods opportunities are massive barriers to ensuring that families are able to get enough to eat or can afford transport to treatment centres when family members fall ill. For those able to afford treatment, there is no guarantee a hospital will have the equipment and supplies to provide care.</p><p>Communities and families are also having to grapple with grave violations against children and growing protection needs. Families have been increasingly forced to resort to negative coping mechanisms to survive, with children and adolescents most affected. Girls in particular often find themselves forced into early marriage, a means by which families try to reduce expenses and obtain a dowry to support the rest of the family. According to UNICEF, more than two-thirds of girls in Yemen are forced to marry before they are 18 years old, an increase from the already high rate of 50% before the conflict.</p><p>Operational challenges</p><p>Access constraints, including from the deteriorating security situation, hinder staff movements.</p><p>What’s worked?</p><p>Four approaches have been key to reaching Yemeni children and their families.</p><p>First, Save the Children designs activities to reflect the centrality of protection, where protection is a core intended outcome of all humanitarian action. The second approach is ensuring that programmes and staff can meet rapidly changing needs by adapting the response.</p><p>Third, the sustainability of protection programming is best achieved through participation and partnership, building on local initiatives.</p><p>Fourth, while an ongoing challenge, working with authorities and addressing perceptions of protection is a fundamental component to success.</p><p>Challenges and ways forward</p><p>There is always scope to improve.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>It can be easy to lose sight of opportunities to positively affect a crisis as large and complex as Yemen’s – not only when seeking to influence key decision-makers, but also in humanitarian organisations’ own plans to respond. Moments to stop, take stock of challenges, determine common elements of success across interventions and ensure that such thinking feeds into future programmes are, at a macro level, fundamental to improving impact in any response. At the micro level, it is individuals’ brave efforts and personal stories that motivate us to do all we can to change the situation in Yemen for the better and ensure a safe future for children – by Mohammed Alshamaa, Amanda Brydon</p><p><span><a href="https://odihpn.org/magazine/dynamic-approaches-child-protection-humanitarian-response-yemen/">https://odihpn.org/magazine/dynamic-approaches-child-protection-humanitarian-response-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>When the needs are overwhelming: balancing quality and coverage in a hospital in Yemen</p><p>MSF’s Yemeni and international staff face a seemingly unending and increasing demand for healthcare, but they cannot treat everyone. Limits have had to be set, posing a host of ethical dilemmas for MSF’s operational decision-making.</p><p>These dilemmas have revolved around how MSF can treat more patients while maintaining a high standard of medical care. This has involved a series of measures and decisions, including restricting admissions, referring patients to other hospitals, moving patients more quickly through the hospital and deciding not to expand the project’s activities. While the physical dimensions of the hospital building are the main limiting factor in being able to treat more patients, these decisions have further restricted MSF’s response. These decisions are rigorously debated, sometimes disagreed with, but in the end implemented by hundreds of staff in the hospital, with life and death consequences for thousands of women and children and their families</p><p>One of the key measures to manage excessive demand has been to restrict access to maternity and child services. When the hospital opened, the admission criteria were restricted to pregnant women and children under 10, but as demand for services has grown the criteria have narrowed to exclude children over five. Growing demand was the key driver behind the change, but what is not clear is how much of the increased demand has been a result of growing needs, or improved acceptance and awareness of MSF.</p><p>In the hospital’s 36-bed neo-natal ward, which is reserved for serious cases, admission criteria are restricted to those born in the hospital.</p><p>Even with restricted admission criteria, there are still thousands of patients MSF does not have the capacity to treat. MSF refers some to a network of four private hospitals and another MSF hospital in Ibb Governorate, to the north of Houbanan be admitted to the ward has posed one of the most serious dilemmas for staff.</p><p>For everything that has been done, a much longer list has been debated and tested.</p><p>Primary healthcare</p><p>The demand for healthcare raised the question of whether MSF should start supporting primary healthcare centres in more rural districts, to help address the health problems that give rise to complicated pregnancies. In many ways, this was a logical development in that it would hopefully reduce the number of women arriving with life-threatening complications. However, there were several arguments against the idea.</p><p>Advocacy</p><p>In deciding not to support primary healthcare centres, advocacy took on added importance. Advocacy was aimed at pushing health actors, including UN agencies and NGOs, to increase the provision of primary healthcare and sexual and reproductive health services. The hope was that this would help reduce the maternal, neo-natal and child mortality MSF was seeing by providing more options to address complications with pregnancies at an earlier stage.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>MSF staff in Taiz have gone to great lengths to address healthcare needs, but within the constraints of the current project set-up they are reaching their limits. Aside from continued discussions as to whether certain departments within the hospital could be reconfigured or handed over to other health actors there is little left to pursue internally.</p><p>How the project will cope with increasing demand in the future and successfully advocate with other actors to increase their health interventions remain open questions for now. The solutions will not be ideal, but hopefully decisions will be made ‘consciously and in consideration of ethical principles such as minimizing harm, maximizing benefits, equity and fairness’. – by Padraic McCluskey, Jana Brandt</p><p><span><a href="https://odihpn.org/magazine/needs-overwhelming-balancing-quality-coverage-hospital-yemen/">https://odihpn.org/magazine/needs-overwhelming-balancing-quality-coverage-hospital-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>The challenges of humanitarian information and analysis: evidence from Yemen</p><p>Data challenges and constraints</p><p>Data transparency, data sharing and independent checks</p><p>A major concern regarding the analysis of food security, malnutrition and famine in Yemen is around data transparency. Most data is collected either by, or in close collaboration with, authorities (either the internationally recognised government in Aden or the de facto Houthi authorities in Sana’a). Data on food security, nutrition and mortality cannot be taken out of the country, and there are extreme limits on the extent to which data is shared even within the country. Independent, routine checks are limited or not allowed on certain types of data. In the absence of data sharing, there are questions about its quality and independence. In many cases, data is missing or very limited. SMART surveys are undertaken only very occasionally and are often out of the timeline of IPC analyses. Data is often not available or is as much as a year old by the time analysis is conducted. Data on sectors other than food security and nutrition is limited.</p><p>Analysis challenges and constraints</p><p>The central conundrum of the analysis in Yemen is that indicators of food insecurity have looked very severe for a long time but malnutrition figures have stayed fairly low, and official mortality figures are very low – even zero in some cases. The main question concerns what could explain nutritional resilience in the face of such a serious, widespread and long-lasting food security crisis. Most of the other causal factors that might be expected to explain the nutrition figures (health, WASH) are also bad. Aside from the fact that the nutrition data was out of date for the 2018 analysis, no comprehensive explanation emerged.</p><p>Influences on food security analysis in Yemen</p><p>Independence of data collection and analysis</p><p>Although many respondents noted that data collection processes had improved in recent years, a number of constraints on the independence of the analysis remain. Nutrition data is viewed as very political. Examples were cited where SMART surveys and enumerator training were disrupted by national security officials, making further collection and assessment of information very difficult. Incidents were reported where ‘minders’ accompanied field teams and told people how to answer questions. Combined with concerns about the lack of data transparency and sharing, this has led to a situation where many respondents suspect the independence of the data.</p><p>In terms of the analysis, disagreements have been reported on how final numbers of people in need are determined, but no clear, overall pattern emerges from the interview evidence for this study.</p><p>Access constraints</p><p>The second major way in which the results of the analysis are potentially distorted concerns populations that are accessible and those that are not. An estimated 1.4 million people are living in inaccessible areas, and the extent to which available data accurately reflects their conditions is not known</p><p>Influences. The data collection and analysis process may be influenced in several ways. One of these is access and, when access is blocked, how agency leadership can take up concerns with the authorities. Some respondents mentioned intimidation as a real deterrent to this kind of support. At the same time, there is persistent pressure, at least at a high level, for positive publicity from donors which are also direct belligerents in the war that is driving the humanitarian crisis. Some agency directors, and at times the Humanitarian Coordinator, engage with the Yemeni authorities to ensure access. This process needs to be regularised, and pressure needs to be maintained until better access is achieved. This requires strong and sustained advocacy with the authorities. Donors can help as well – by Lindsay Spainhour Baker, Peter Hailey, Jeeyon Kim, Daniel Maxwell</p><p><span><a href="https://odihpn.org/magazine/humanitarian-information-analysis-evidence-yemen/">https://odihpn.org/magazine/humanitarian-information-analysis-evidence-yemen/</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fortsetzung / Sequel: cp4 – cp18</span></h2><p><strong><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-631b-yemen-war-mosaic-631b">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-631b-yemen-war-mosaic-631b</a></strong></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vorige / Previous:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-630-yemen-war-mosaic-630/">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-630-yemen-war-mosaic-630/</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 1-630 / Yemen War Mosaic 1-630:</span></h2><p><span>https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose oder / or <a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Der saudische Luftkrieg im Bild / Saudi aerial war images:</span></h2><p><span>(18 +, Nichts für Sensible!) / (18 +; Graphic!)</span></p><p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/">http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://www.yemenwar.info/">http://www.yemenwar.info/</a> </span></p><p>Liste aller Luftangriffe / and list of all air raids:</p><p><span><a href="http://yemendataproject.org/data/">http://yemendataproject.org/data/</a></span></p><p>Untersuchung ausgewählter Luftangriffe durch Bellingcat / Bellingcat investigations of selected air raids:</p><p><span><a href="https://yemen.bellingcat.com/">https://yemen.bellingcat.com/</a></span></p><p><span>Untersuchungen von Angriffen, hunderte von Filmen / Investigations of attacks, hundreds of films:</span></p><p><span><a href="https://yemeniarchive.org/en">https://yemeniarchive.org/en</a></span></p></div>
