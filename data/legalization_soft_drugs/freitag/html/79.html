Alternatively, they could work in cities in sweatshops producing clothes for a global market . . . or the soon booming oil and gas projects.”</p><p>Blumi’s book documents the fiercely stubborn creativity with which, decade by decade, Yemenis kept surprising the West, exploring and pursuing countermeasures to resist its exploitative control, and risking the West’s destructive anger. </p><p>When farmers desperate for cash went to work in Saudi Arabia, for instance, “they consistently sent remittances home to families that saved the cash and invested in local projects, using local bank transfers.” Imams and village leaders encouraged people to resist imperialist “modernization” projects, knowing that the West's preferred “modern” role for them was as wage slaves with no hope of developing a better future.</p><p>The “Huthi” movement began when Husayn al-Huthi, an opponent of Yemen’s dictatorial (and Western-allied) Saleh regime, tried to defend the water and land rights of locals in the Sa’adah province in northwestern Yemen. Sharing what was then a porous and informal border with the KSA, they often found themselves in disputes with Saudi border patrols. They also resisted ‘structural adjustment’ demands by the International Monetary Fund to privatize some of Yemen’s best farming and grazing land. When the dictator Saleh made criminal concessions to the KSA, al-Huthi and his followers persisted with protests. Each new confrontation won over thousands of people, eventually spreading beyond Sa’adah.</p><p>Blumi cites numerous instances in which Yemen’s economic assets were pillaged, with Saleh’s approval, by “well-heeled global financial interests.” – by Kathy Kelly</p><p><span><a href="https://progressive.org/dispatches/death-bloodshed-and-misery-in-yemen-191015/">https://progressive.org/dispatches/death-bloodshed-and-misery-in-yemen-191015/</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://dissidentvoice.org/2019/10/death-misery-and-bloodshed-in-yemen/">https://dissidentvoice.org/2019/10/death-misery-and-bloodshed-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/ifrc">International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies</a>: Yemen’s Healthcare System on the Brink of Collapse</strong></p><p>Yemen’s Healthcare System on the Brink of Collapse</p><p>According to doctor Anisha who has worked in the clinic for 17 years, Luai’s story is sadly familiar.</p><p>“Five years ago, we did not see many cases of malnutrition”, she says.</p><p>“But now there are cases in all health clinics around the country. I am worried because it affects their ability to learn in school. We only see the mild cases in this clinic.”</p><p>Doctor Anisha also sees many malnourished pregnant women which can lead to complications like low birth weight and premature births.</p><p>According to UN OCHA 3,2 million women and children in Yemen are acutely malnourished – the number of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition has increased by 90% in the last three years.</p><p>And it is not only malnutrition the children suffer from.</p><p>“We see that diseases like measles, diphtheria and chicken pox have returned. They were not present before the conflict,” says doctor Anisha.</p><p>She used to vaccinate the children, but the clinic can no longer provide this vital service. The vaccinations need to be stored in a cold place, but because of the lack of electricity and fuel, this is no longer an option.</p><p>It is the same story with the X-ray machine which has not been working since the beginning of the conflict. And the ultrasound scanner has been silent for the last year, since the clinic cannot afford to pay salary to an ultrasound doctor who can operate it.</p><p>Doctor Anisha is the only doctor to help the approximately 40 patients who come to the clinic every day.</p><p>“We need more doctors and nurses in the clinic,” she says, adding:</p><p>“And we need medicine to treat patients with hypertension and diabetes. We can check their blood pressure and blood sugar, but we cannot give them medicine. Medicine is the most important.”</p><p>The clinic has a laboratory, but currently they cannot carry out liver, kidney and cholesterol tests because of lack of equipment. Today it is free for the patients to get tests done in the laboratory, but in the future, the clinic might be forced to demand payment.</p><p>It is not going to be easy for the patients.</p><p>“Our patients are poor,” says doctor Anisha.</p><p>Stay and risk your own life</p><p>Many doctors and nurses have fled from the conflict in Yemen. But not Doctor Anisha.</p><p>“The future is horrible. If you stay here, you are killing yourself. But I stay and do my best. I cannot leave my patients here.

Drivers are queuing for two to three days to fill up, and the knock-on effects are being felt throughout the country, with food, water and other necessities in short supply. We call on the government of Yemen to end restrictions on the import of fuel.</p><p>“When the war escalated, fuel quickly disappeared from the market and prices started to soar in a dramatic way.”</p><p>Unable to afford cooking gas</p><p>“The income I made was hardly enough to buy food and other basic commodities, but we just about managed to survive,” she explains. “But with a new fuel crisis since late September, nowadays I can’t work at all. Cooking gas has disappeared from the markets and I can’t afford the prices on the black market.</p><p>“The prices of flour, sugar, cooking oil have all increased over the last few weeks, and the main reason is that we are experiencing a fuel shortage. Life is worsening, and I can’t afford to work or buy food.”</p><p>Malayeen used to have customers in neighbourhoods that were a long distance away, but she was forced to stop selling to them as it became difficult to pay for fuel to transport the sweets. Nowadays she can’t afford to buy diesel or gas to cook with because prices have risen exorbitantly.</p><p>A three-day queue for fuel</p><p>In Sana’a, the price of fuel for Yemeni citizens has risen to YER 800/litre compared to YER 365/litre on the official market in Sana’a, and the price of diesel to YER 1,000/litre compared to YER 375/litre on the official market.</p><p>On the black market, fuel prices have soared even further, reaching over YER 20,000/20 litres, almost three times the official price. Fuel stations are completely closed or have limited operating hours, creating queues several kilometres long and wait times of two to three days.</p><p>The impact of this increase is being felt by vulnerable Yemenis already suffering from prolonged conflict. The UN estimates that 10 million hungry Yemenis who are already one step away from famine will soon not be able to buy food in the markets.</p><p>Government restrictions causing shortages</p><p>Since mid-September 2019, northern Yemen has been experiencing acute fuel and gas shortages as a result of new regulations on commercial fuel imports imposed by the government of Yemen.</p><p>This is leading to delays in approving ships to offload fuel and gas at the Red Sea port of Hodeidah. Yemen imports the vast majority – around 90 per cent – of its food, fuel and commercial supplies, and these delays are making a bad humanitarian situation even worse.</p><p>Service cuts threaten thousands of lives</p><p>Fuel is needed not just for cars but also for water pumps, hospital generators and to transport goods around the country. In some parts of the country, the water supply in urban centres has been forced to stop completely for up to two weeks. Poor sanitation and a lack of safe water is increasing the risk of deadly diseases such as cholera, which has already claimed close to 1,000 lives this year.</p><p>The impact on hundreds of thousands of families is already being felt. People barely surviving now will find it much harder to do so unless adequate levels of commercial imports – including fuel – are able to enter the country continuously through all ports.</p><p>Fuel restrictions must be lifted</p><p>The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) is extremely concerned about the impact of the fuel crisis on Yemeni civilians. Humanitarian operations are also being affected by the fuel shortages. Aid organisations are being prevented from providing life-saving assistance, with support for malnourished children suspended, and food and water distributions reduced.</p><p>We are calling on the government of Yemen to remove all restrictions affecting the import of commercial fuel.</p><p>Malayeen concludes: “Beautiful days have gone and the fuel crisis is causing the mother of all suffering.

All parties, including the United States, should seize this rare opportunity to resolve the conflict.</p><p>With all of U.S. President Donald Trump’s troubles at home and abroad, his administration could use a win. There is low-hanging fruit in Yemen, and the ripple effects of success there could go far beyond the impoverished and war-torn country. Houthi rebels (who prefer to be called Ansar Allah) have made an offer of de-escalation that, if built on quickly, could help extract the United States from the bloody and unwinnable war that has created the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. It would reduce threats to Saudi Arabia and its oil infrastructure at a time of rising tensions with Iran. And it would open a door to wider de-escalation inside Yemen and possibly across the region.</p><p>On Sept. 20, the Houthis—who control northwestern Yemen and have been at war with a variety of Yemeni groups backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates since 2015—announced a unilateral suspension of strikes on Saudi Arabia. In return, they asked for a halt to Saudi airstrikes and a lifting of restrictions on access to northern Yemen.</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, the Saudi response to Houthi overtures has been mostly positive. They have not suspended airstrikes but have reportedly reduced them in some areas. They have facilitated the entry of a number of fuel shipments into Houthi-controlled territory, albeit not enough to address the ongoing fuel crisis. The Houthis unilaterally released almost 300 prisoners, including three Saudis. Both sides have exchanged unusually positive public signals indicating interest in de-escalation, and they have reportedly reopened back-channel discussions.</p><p>For Riyadh, ending the war in Yemen likely acquired new urgency in the wake of the Saudi Aramco attacks, which brought home the stakes of a hot war with Iran while piercing a gaping hole in the U.S. security umbrella. At a minimum, the Yemen war is a costly and dangerous distraction that keeps the Saudis focused south when attention could be directed elsewhere.</p><p>It tests and uncovers the kingdom’s military vulnerabilities and potentially allows Iran plausible deniability through the Houthis to launch attacks. And there are no easy military options for turning the tide against the Houthis. After the United Nations prevented an attack on the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida in December 2018, Saudi Arabia’s main coalition partner, the UAE, redeployed its forces and now sees little point in continuing the effectively stalemated war in the north.</p><p>This opportunity should be embraced, particularly by the United States, which has been complicit in Riyadh’s war and could now encourage its Saudi allies to reach an understanding with the Houthis that includes significant reductions in cross-border attacks.</p><p>If successful, this could serve as a foundation for a U.N.-brokered cease-fire agreement between Yemeni antagonists—including the Houthis, the Yemeni government, and Emirati-backed southern separatists, among others—and the resumption of intra-Yemeni negotiations to end the civil war.

Members of Congress working with Emirati foreign agents continue to fight for U.S. military support to the UAE, Middle East experts—some at think tanks which the UAE has donated millions to—echo the UAE lobby’s talking points, and UAE foreign agents have effectively shaped media narratives by working closely with journalists and reporters at nearly every mainstream media outlet.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Following Khashoggi’s murder, several lobbying, public relations firms, and think tanks ended their relationship with the Saudis. Congress passed multiple resolutions to punish the Saudis. And, generally, the Saudis were seen as something of a pariah in D.C. Yet, Saudi Arabia’s close ally, the United Arab Emirates, continues to be seen as a stalwart U.S. ally by most in the nation’s capital. While the Emiratis had nothing to do with Khashoggi’s murder they’ve worked hand-in-hand with the Saudis in the devastating war in Yemen—including funding a targeted assassination program there—that has become the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. And, the UAE, just like Saudi Arabia, has an abhorrent human rights record—arbitrarily detaining and disappearing its own citizens and unlawfully imprisoning Western academics. Most recently, the UAE launched a crackdown on social media to silence and punish dissidents.</p><p>How then has the UAE maintained its privileged status? In short, the UAE has a vast and immensely influential lobbying and public relations campaign in America, that has allowed the monarchy to exert considerable sway over U.S. policy while keeping the UAE’s indiscretions largely hidden. While both the UAE’s Ambassador in the U.S., Yousef al Otaiba, and the Crown Prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed,13 are well known for the enormous sway they hold over U.S. policymakers, it’s much less understood how the influence operation of the lobbying and public relations firms on the Emiratis’ payroll pave the way for these power brokers.</p><p>In this report we attempt to tell the story of that influence operation. To do so, the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative (FITI), a program of the Center for International Policy, analyzed every Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) Supplemental Statement filed by organizations working on behalf of clients in the United Arab Emirates in 2018. We cataloged every single “political activity” and campaign contribution reported in those documents. From this analysis we document a multi-pronged approach to image management by the UAE’s foreign agents working in the U.S. The work of these foreign agents includes contacting members of Congress in hopes of maintaining U.S. military support, working hand-in-hand with Middle East experts at think tanks which the UAE has donated millions to, and attempting to shape the narrative of the UAE by contacting nearly every mainstream media outlet – by Ben Freeman</p><p><span><a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/3ba8a1_cc7f1fad2f7a497ba5fb159a6756c34a.pdf?index=true">https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/3ba8a1_cc7f1fad2f7a497ba5fb159a6756c34a.pdf?index=true</a></span></p><p>if this link does not work, go <span><a href="https://twitter.com/BenFreemanDC/status/1184122484527894528">https://twitter.com/BenFreemanDC/status/1184122484527894528</a></span></p><p><span>and a shorter survey by Aljazeera: <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/report-outlines-uae-immensely-influential-lobbying-191016141913262.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/report-outlines-uae-immensely-influential-lobbying-191016141913262.html</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Britisches Geheimprogramm für die saudische Nationalgarde</strong></p><p>USA und Großbritannien arbeiten gegen Milliarden mit der saudischen Nationalgarde zusammen, die das saudische Herrscherhaus schützen soll und im Jemenkrieg eingesetzt ist</p><p>Vor kurzem wurde klar, wie stark die Verbindungen der britischen Regierung mit der saudischen Monarchie sind. Das geht weit über Waffenlieferungen hinaus. Letztlich wurde Großbritannien mit dem saudischen Geld gekauft, das Königshaus zu schützen, also eine völlig undemokratische Macht - und das mit einem Geheimprogramm, das den britischen Wählern möglichst nicht zur Kenntnis gebracht werden soll.</p><p>2018 hatte Boris Johnson, damals noch Außenminister, die Entsendung von einer nicht näher genannten Zahl an britischen Soldaten zur "Information, Beratung und Unterstützung" nach Saudi-Arabien <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2018-05-23/HCWS716/">zugegeben</a>, um der Bedrohung durch Huthi-Raketen zu begegnen. Angeblich wollte man Saudi-Arabien so entlasten, so die scheinheilige Begründung, um eher eine politische Lösung zu finden. Die britischen Soldaten konnten offenbar ebenso wenig wie die amerikanischen die Raketen- und Drohnenangriffe abwehren.</p><p>Versehentlich wurde über eine Stellenausschreibung bekannt, dass die britische Regierung mit einem Budget von zwei Milliarden britischen Pfund die mehr als 130.000 Mann starke Nationalgarde Saudi-Arabiens - auch Weiße Armee genannt - ausbildet, die nicht nur die herrschende königliche Familie schützen soll, also neben der Armee eine mächtige Privatmiliz darstellt, sondern die auch aktiv im Krieg gegen Jemen beteiligt ist und im Inneren militärisch bei Unruhen eingreifen kann. Matt Kennard und Mark Curtis haben <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2019-09-27-britains-secret-saudi-military-support-programme/">untersucht</a>, was von diesem seit 1978 bestehenden Programm des britischen Verteidigungsministeriums bekannt ist, dem seit 1978 bestehenden Saudi Arabia National Guard Communications Project (Sangcom).</p><p>Zweck des Programms soll sein, dass die SANG mit Geldern aus Saudi-Arabien, die ans britische Verteidigungsministerium fließen, mit Kommunikationstechnik ausgestattet wird, wobei das Budget sowie nähere Einzelheiten von der Regierung geheim gehalten werden - vor dem Parlament und der Öffentlichkeit. Nach 40 Jahren wurde durch eine Stellenanzeige - nur für männliche Bewerber - versehentlich erstmals das Budget bekannt. Das Budget von 2 Milliarden soll sich seit 2010 auf einen Zeitraum von 10 Jahren erstrecken und ist deutlich höher als das der vorangehenden Übereinkunft von 125 Millionen. Die Stellenanzeige wurde aus dem Netz genommen, allerdings schrieb der Finanzkontrolleur von Sangcom auf Linkedln, er sei für ein Budget von 1,6 Milliarden Pfund verantwortlich.</p><p>Neben Großbritannien wird die SANG auch vom US-Militär ausgebildet und aufgerüstet. Seit 2015 sind SANG-Einheiten am Jemen-Krieg beteiligt, zwei Brigaden wurden 2018 an der Grenze stationiert. Colonel Kevin Lambert, Programmanger des amerikanischen SANG-Modernisierungsprogramms, bei dem es um 16 Milliarden US-Dollar an Waffenkäufen geht, hat bei seinem Amtsantritt letztes Jahr auch offen <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/213293/cadre_of_professionals_helps_new_program_manager_get_up_to_speed">gesagt</a>, dass er mit seinem Team die Nationalgarde für "Kampfeinsätze an der südlichen Grenze" ausbilde - was Saudi-Arabien wie im Fall von Großbritannien bezahlt: "Die SANG trägt zu Kampfeinsätzen der saudisch geführten Koalition im Jemen-Konflikt bei, die zur regionalen Stabilität beiträgt." Und diese Stabilität durch den Krieg würde wiederum "die militärischen Kapazitäten der USA erhalten und unsere strategische Kampfbereitschaft erhöhen". Es handelt sich also um eine direkte Beihilfe zum Jemen-Krieg.</p><p>Das Geheimprogramm Sangcom des britischen Verteidigungsministeriums liefert der Nationalgarde nicht nur Kommunikationstechnik, sondern bildet Nationalgardisten auch im Umgang mit diesen aus, was aber über die reine Technik hinausgehen könnte, wie dies auch bei den Amerikanern der Fall ist. Wegen der Geheimhaltung ist letztlich nicht bekannt, was Sangcom wirklich macht.</p><p>Seit 1994 wird Sangcom im Auftrag des Verteidigungsministeriums von der Firma GPT Special Project Management Ltd verwaltet, die jetzt zu Airbus gehört. </p><p>Transparency International und Spotlight on Corruption <span><a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/10854-uk-attorney-general-accused-of-blocking-corruption-probe">befürchten</a></span>, dass der britische Generalstaatsanwalt Geoffrey Cox weitere Ermittlungen zu blockieren sucht – von Florian Rötzer</p><p><span><a href="https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Britisches-Geheimprogramm-fuer-die-saudische-Nationalgarde-4555719.html">https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Britisches-Geheimprogramm-fuer-die-saudische-Nationalgarde-4555719.html</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2><p>(* B H)</p><p>Yemen - Conflict (DG ECHO, UN, INGOs) (ECHO Daily Flash of 15 October 2019)</p><p>The cumulative number of suspected cholera cases reported in Yemen between October 2016 and August 2019 is 2,036,960, including 3,716 related deaths (fatality rate of 0.18%).

The water-energy-food insecurity nexus is one of the causes and a continuing result of the current Yemeni conflict. Saudi Arabia is accustomed to playing against known state actors and non-state actors—such as the Iranians or Houthis—and accounting for their actions and interests. However, it is not aware that it is also battling the environment in Yemen, and the consequences of exacerbating the water-energy-food insecurity nexus.</span></p><p><span>A classic example of a developing country facing climate change, Yemen is also plagued with natural resource scarcity—water, oil, and arable land—coupled with chronic natural resource mismanagement.

The Iranian government cannot deal with Trump, who has already burned them in the past and still refuses to offer sanctions relief now. Trump is never going to rejoin the JCPOA or lift sanctions, and Iran won’t agree to the administration’s excessive demands. Finding a way to bring the war on Yemen to an end is the best thing for Yemen and the wider region.

So, I think that was the determining factor and people like me, Ethiopian and Yemeni. We're a huge community, by the way, were called Muwaladeen, which means you're born, or you have some sort of a birth connection to other than Yemen. Unfortunately, because how going around and migrating from one place and escaping famine, both for Yemenis and Ethiopians, so such families are always struggling to find the best education, to not go through unbelievable poverty. </p><p>For example, many times when there are attacks happening in Sanaa, I will get the breaking news from my Tweets or people on Facebook and Instagram and so on before I get a notification from BBC, for example. Yemen, quite often, is not breaking news, but through my online community, it is a breaking news. When the war started, when the Saudi-led coalition began their military operation in 2015, I remember that my family called me and asked me what is happening? And they were in Sanaa and I was like, but you are there, you should know. And they're like we have no idea. There is no electricity, no TV, no radio, nothing. It's dark here. We only hear the bombs. And I was able to tell them what was happening even though I'm miles long away. So, I heavily depend on the Internet and I am proud to say that I've used it to the best way that I can, because I wish I am there, of course, to report from the ground, it's much, much better, but this is what's available at this moment. </p><p>With all due respect to all these newspapers and news websites, I don't read them anymore. I don't. I'd rather spend my time calling on What's App. My refugee journalist friend in Korea who his family in Taiz are facing famine and Houthi snipers or I'd rather call my cousin in Aden, who couldn't pass the checkpoint, because God knows if it's the transitional counsel... or the Emiratis or the Saudis, so I am prioritizing my people. </p><p>Yes, it's nice to read some analysis from international newspapers, but very often I get emails by these writers asking for my insight, which is also another unpaid job for a freelance journalist. So, it's a very tense relationship that I have with international media today because Yemeni is... you need a local connection really to really feel how the feeling is in these cities. So that's what I try to always focus on. </p><p>I really believe that women in the North, women in the South, will have a huge role in achieving that peace. So, you have all the statistics about the famine, the cholera, but at the same time, there is a huge resistance from Yemeni women, and it's very admirable. Yemeni women used to have better women's rights than their sisters in UAE and Saudi Arabia. In this war, you can see women's rights and Yemen going really back a generation behind. </p><p><span><a href="http://afrahnasser.blogspot.com/2019/10/podcast-investigative-journalists-speak.html">http://afrahnasser.blogspot.com/2019/10/podcast-investigative-journalists-speak.html</a></span></p><p><span>(B K P)</span></p><p>The West and its Allies Support al Qaeda and ISIS Globally</p><p>The real Axis of Evil consists of Washington-led NATO and its allies.

Experts say it’s more complicated than that, with unstable regional alliances intermingling with divergent interests among the coalition allies. </p><p>From the perspective of U.S. foreign policy, those nuances don’t matter. </p><p>Since 2014, America’s backing of the Saudis in Yemen, including as their chief arms provider, directly implicates us in the ongoing atrocities there. </p><p>There’s no realistic chance that the savagery in Yemen will abate under the Trump administration, which has continued to support Saudi actions (and has continued to kill civilians elsewhere in drone strikes). </p><p>The real question is, will the next administration have any desire to chart a new course? </p><p>When push comes to shove, most Americans just don’t care about foreign policy, until it ends up as blowback in the form of a catastrophe on American soil. So we can expect little focus on it during the 2020 campaign, except insofar as Trump’s impulsivity undermines American diplomacy. </p><p>Still, it’s worth asking whether Democratic presidential contenders can wean their party’s own penchant for destructive indifference in Yemen and elsewhere.

The strategy relies heavily on sanctions to change Iranian behavior by complicating its access to external markets and the international financial infrastructure. The overarching objective is to deny Tehran the financial resources required to maintain nuclear and missile programs and a network of proxies including Lebanese Hezbollah, various Shiite militias in Iraq, the Houthis in Yemen, and a growing network of foreign fighters in Syria recruited by Iran from Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p><p>It’s impossible to deny that the maximum pressure campaign has damaged Iran. The country’s economy has slowed down significantly, and its oil revenues have plummeted. As the Trump administration sees it, Iran now has fewer resources to devote to its regional agenda.
