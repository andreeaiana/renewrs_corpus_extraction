That support has resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians, and the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Read about the cost of US involvement, and learn what you can do to end it.</p><p>The Saudi and UAE-led coalition’s intervention — dubbed Operation Decisive Storm — started with a relentless campaign of airstrikes on Houthi positions across the country. From the outset this air campaign has been characterized by indiscriminate attacks on alleged military sites in the midst of populated areas.</p><p>While <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the-deadly-war-in-yemen-rages-on-so-why-does-the-death-toll-stand-still-/2018/08/02/e6d9ebca-9022-11e8-ae59-01880eac5f1d_story.html?utm_term=.51fcd710f900">no official figures</a></span> are available, total civilian deaths from violence number well over 10,000. Monthly fatalities have <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/sep/26/huge-spike-in-yemen-violence-as-civilian-deaths-rise-by-164-in-four-months-hodeidah">increased by 164%</a></span> since June 2018, when UAE and pro-government forces launched a disastrous new offensive on the city of al-Hudaydah, home to Yemen’s most vital sea port.</p><p>The Houthis have lagged behind the coalition in terms of civilian casualties inflicted, but not for lack of trying. The UN has estimated that coalition airstrikes are responsible for at <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/responsibility-civilian-casualties-yemen">least 60% of civilian casualties</a></span>. Though they lack an air force, the Houthis have routinely <span><a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/houthis-shell-poor-residential-area-of-taez-killing-10-civilians-1.39039">shelled</a></span> civilian neighborhoods, laid hundreds of thousands of <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/300000-houthi-landmines-removed-yemen">landmines</a></span> throughout the territory they’ve ceded since 2015, and <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/09/25/yemen-houthi-hostage-taking">detained</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/17/yemen-abusive-detention-rife-under-houthis">disappeared</a></span>, or tortured thousands of innocent people.</p><p>The main cause of suffering in Yemen has not been the violence itself. Instead, the extreme humanitarian crisis is largely the result of disastrous economic decisions by Yemen’s legitimate government in exile, and of an illegal blockade on humanitarian and commercial traffic imposed by Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Due to those factors — as well as the Houthis’ appropriation of state wealth and manipulation of the black market — the price of food, fuel, and other necessities has skyrocketed, while Yemen’s currency has plummeted to roughly a third of its pre-war value. This means that even in parts of the country where staple goods are not in short supply, they are far too expensive for most Yemenis.</p><p>Since the start of the Saudi-led intervention the U.S. has provided logistical and intelligence assistance to the coalition’s air campaign. The U.S. has also sold billions of dollars’ worth of ordnance, aircraft, and weapons systems to Saudi Arabia and the UAE since 2014. U.S. involvement stems in part from the longstanding security partnership between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, and partly from concern over Iran’s influence in the region.</p><p>While Saudi Arabia receives most of the attention for the intervention in Yemen, the UAE is perhaps even more deeply involved in the war.</p><p>The majority of the coalition’s <span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/setting-limits-on-the-saudi-air-campaign-in-yemen">combat airstrikes</a></span> are conducted by the UAE, though the coalition is <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/08/24/hiding-behind-coalition/failure-credibly-investigate-and-provide-redress-unlawful">deliberately opaque</a></span> about such aspects of its operations. Beyond the air campaign, the UAE has put boots on the ground in Yemen — something Saudi Arabia has been very reluctant to do.</p><p>Yemeni researchers, international organizations, and a<span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/YemenGEE/Pages/Index.aspx"> special expert group established by the UN Human Rights Council</a></span>have found that <span><a href="http://mwatana.org/en/yemen-upr/">all parties</a></span> in Yemen’s war have committed grave violations of human rights and the laws of war. These violations begin at the macro level and define the very nature of the war.</p><p>Civil wars with external intervention are generally longer and more difficult to end than strictly internal conflicts. That means that if Americans want to see an end to the suffering in Yemen, they need to do everything they can to pull the U.S. and its allies out of this war (photos, infographics)</p><p><span><a href="https://www.yemenpeaceproject.org/invisible">https://www.yemenpeaceproject.org/invisible</a></span></p><p>My remark: On the making, below in cp1.</p><p>(* B H K P)</p><p>Human Rights Watch: Yemen, Events of 2018</p><p>The armed conflict in Yemen has killed and injured thousands of Yemeni civilians since it began. As of November 2018, 6,872 civilians had been killed and 10,768 wounded, the majority by Saudi Arabia-led coalition airstrikes, <span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23855&amp;LangID=E">according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)</a></span>. The actual civilian casualties are likely much higher. Thousands more have been displaced by the fighting and millions suffer from shortages of food and medical care.</p><p>Parties to the conflict have exacerbated what the UN has called the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe, including by unlawfully impeding delivery of desperately needed humanitarian aid.</p><p>The armed conflict has taken a terrible toll on the civilian population. The coalition has conducted scores of indiscriminate and disproportionate airstrikes killing thousands of civilians and hitting civilian objects in violation of the laws of war, using munitions sold by the United States, United Kingdom, and others, including widely banned cluster munitions. Houthi forces have used banned antipersonnel landmines, recruited children, and fired artillery indiscriminately into cities such as Taizz and Aden, killing and wounding civilians, and launched indiscriminate rockets into Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Both sides have harassed, threatened, and attacked Yemeni activists and journalists. </p><p>Despite mounting evidence of violations of international law by the parties to the conflict, efforts toward accountability have been woefully inadequate.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/yemen">https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/yemen</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1 Am wichtigsten / Most important</span></h2><p><strong>(** B H K P)</strong></p><p><strong>The Forgotten War: Yemen</strong></p><p>Der Konflikt im Jemen scheint angesichts der schweren humanitären Katastrophen weltweit in Vergessenheit geraten zu sein. Dennoch hat sich der Konflikt seit seiner Eskalation vor rund vier Jahren zu einer der schwersten humanitären Krisen der jüngeren Geschichte entwickelt ohne dass ein Ende in Sicht ist. Tausende von Menschen wurden getötet und noch mehr vertrieben; das Land steht vor einer enormen Ernährungsunsi-cherheit und dem größten Cholera-Ausbruch der Welt. Es ist nicht mehr allein ein Bürgerkrieg zwischen der Houthi- und Hadi-Fraktion. Internationale Interessen spielen eine große Rolle. Es handelt sich um einen Stellvertreterkrieg zwischen Saudi-Arabien (und seinen Verbündeten) auf der einen und dem Iran auf der anderen Seite. Dies alles geschieht auf Kosten der Zivilbevölkerung. Daher ist es dringend geboten, die beteiligten Akteure, ihre Interessen im Konflikt zu analysieren und darüber hinaus nach Möglichkeiten zu suchen, diesen zu überwinden.</p><p>The conflict in Yemen seems forgotten considering the worldwide severe humanitarian catastrophes. Nevertheless, since the conflict escalated around four years ago, it became one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history and has no end in sight. Thousands of people were killed even more displaced and the country is facing tremendous food insecurity as well as the world’s largest cholera outbreak. It is no longer just a civil war between the Houthi- and Hadi-Faction. International interests play a major role and made it a proxy war between Saudi Arabia (and its allies) on one side and Iran on the other. This all happens at the expense of the civilian population. Therefore, it is urgent to analyse the actors involved, their interests within the conflict and furthermore searching for possibilities to overcome it.</p><p>In the following there will be a brief overview of how the whole conflict emerged. Afterwards, due to restricted space, the focus of the article will be limited to the current conflict (after 2015), its main actors and their specific positions and interests. Finally, the concluding remarks will describe what a potential conflict solution could look like. These then come full circle and illuminate this article is focused only on certain aspects.</p><p>The internal crisis was surpassed by the Saudi-led military intervention in March 2015, due to Saudi Arabia holding Iran responsible for backing up the Houthis to gain regional power.11 This intervention brought a multidimensional, nearly insuperable regional conflict between two global players into an already complex civil war, significantly complicating the issue.1</p><p>Today, at its core the conflict is about political power on the national, regional and international level and involves also forces in every of these layers.13 The violence can be divided into four sets: The Houthi – Hadi conflict; the regional conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia; the extremist organisations AQAP and IS which have seized the opportunity to establish themselves in Yemen; and local power affecting tribal and sectarian division.</p><p><span>Conclusion</span></p><p>The glimpse provided is just a fraction of the whole issue. There are other ways to look at the conflict, and not every actor, issue, position and interest behind could be addressed here. However, this overview demonstrates the complexity of the conflict and highlights one promising path to overcoming the conflict: ensuring that the peace process is inclusive, participatory and representative across society.96 The international community right now has an opportunity to build an inclusive platform for peace talks and even if the international conflict persists, harmonizing the local communities could make them reject violence and protect themselves from staying in a cycle of conflict.97 Since previous attempts at peace and the NDC failed, past mistakes must be prevented and a new understanding of policy objectives needs to be addressed. This should include in the long-term: peace talks on every track in the Multi-Track-Diplomacy system and a ‘bottom-up approach’ to forming sustainable peace in Yemen.</p><p>Nevertheless, the most urgent step to stop the acute suffering of the population is an immediate ceasefire widely accepted by the national and international actors.

Hurd makes a number of questionable and misleading claims in his op-ed, and some of the things he says are outright false. He wants to create the impression that Congressional opposition to U.S. arms sales to the Saudi coalition and to the war on Yemen are driven solely by outrage over the grisly murder of Jamal Khashoggi on the Saudi crown prince’s orders. That is false, as many of his colleagues have made clear during their efforts to bring U.S. involvement to an end over several years. </p><p>Hurd’s decision to frame the debate over Yemen as a matter of sending messages to Iran tells us that he doesn’t know the conflict or the country very well. “I know Yemen,” he asserts, but all that he seems to know are the pro-Saudi talking points that he recites. </p><p>Like many other hawks, Rep. Hurd chooses to portray the war as a fight against Iranian influence. That is not just overly simplistic, but actually gets the real nature of the conflict wrong. The conflict has its origins in internal Yemeni rivalries and grievances, and it was the Saudis and Emiratis that exploited that conflict in an attempt to carve out their own spheres of influence. </p><p> The Saudi and Emirati governments are out for their own interests and couldn’t care less about the damage that they do to Yemen in the process. </p><p>Helping the Saudis and Emiratis to destroy Yemen doesn’t hurt Iran in the slightest, and it doesn’t serve any U.S. interests, but it does make the U.S. party to terrible crimes and makes our government one of the authors of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Hurd tries to create the impression that the humanitarian crisis is the result of the overthrow of the Hadi government.</p><p>The beginning of Yemen’s descent into deepening famine and the rapid spread of preventable disease was not the takeover in 2014, but the Saudi-led intervention in March 2015. The suffering is most acute in Houthi-controlled areas because that is where most of the population lives and those are the areas that the Saudi coalition has been trying to starve. </p><p>If Hurd wants to pass a resolution condemning Houthi abuses and crimes <em>along with</em> the abuses and crimes of the Saudi coalition, he will find plenty of support from opponents of the war, but his resolution and his op-ed are pretty clearly efforts to change the subject from Saudi coalition war crimes and continued U.S. support for the coalition.</p><p>Trying to make the vote about Yemen into a litmus test about Iran is a disservice to people in Yemen and to his own constituents. The war on Yemen is not about Iran despite the best efforts of pro-Saudi lobbyists to pretend otherwise. Carrying water for the Saudis and Emiratis has nothing to do with demonstrating support for the people of Yemen.</p><p>Our government’s Yemen policy is as despicable and indefensible as it is because both the Obama and Trump administrations believed that indulging Saudi Arabia and the UAE was more important than pursuing a policy that served U.S. interests and values – by Daniel Larison</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/a-shameful-op-ed-on-yemen/">https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/a-shameful-op-ed-on-yemen/</a></span></p><p>referring to</p><p>(A P)</p><p>Congress Emboldens Iran in the Name of Peace in Yemen</p><p>Instead, condemn the Houthis for human-rights violations and demand they observe a cease-fire.</p><p>With tensions escalating in the Middle East, Congress is emboldening Iran by sending the wrong message about Yemen. Last week the Senate voted to halt military sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Earlier this year, President Trump was forced to veto a congressional resolution aimed at ending U.S. assistance to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Congress evidently can’t separate its response to the killing of Jamal Khashoggi from the threats posed by the Houthis, Iranians and terrorists in Yemen. This is no time to be sending mixed messages to Tehran.</p><p>Since 2014, when the Iranian-backed Houthi government attacked Yemen’s internationally recognized government and seized the capital, Sana’a, the country has descended into a humanitarian crisis that is among the world’s worst.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-emboldens-iran-in-the-name-of-peace-in-yemen-11561503382">https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-emboldens-iran-in-the-name-of-peace-in-yemen-11561503382</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>The best laid plans: Visualising Yemen’s Invisible War</strong></p><p>one year ago when I was wrapping up a project with Yemen Peace Project and Data for Change working on <span><a href="http://www.yemenpeaceproject.org/invisible">Visualising Yemen’s Invisible War</a></span>which is the project we launched in December last year. With that out of the way, I can get jump into the project, the processes involved, how it developed and the final output.</p><p>The original idea of the project came out of a 2016 Beirut based data for change workshop, one that I had attended as a participant.</p><p>If you really want all the details you can visit the <span><a href="https://www.yemenpeaceproject.org/invisible">project link</a></span> — as I hope to explain, we’ve done some really nice stuff to make the data more accessible.</p><p>We worked with a dataset that recorded the volume of air-strikes in Yemen and the kind of sites that were targeted, where they were located and when they took place.</p><p>Following a lull after the 2016 workshop we resurrected the project in late 2017. The project was to create an interactive story that maps the airstrikes in three major cities in Yemen and video interviews of residents in collaboration with the original organisation who had brought the dataset.</p><p>But the project went through many embodiments.</p><p>In September 2018 we partnered with a DC based advocacy organisation dedicated solely to Yemeni affairs and the US-Yemen relationship. This was a stroke of luck! It did mean though the entire idea of the project changed.</p><p>Meanwhile I had gone through a dozen rounds of updating the data, codifying it and cleaning it. In the early days I struggled to keep up with the rapidly updating dataset while managing the project.</p><p>The first ever dataset we got our hands on recorded the airstrikes from march 2015 to august 2016. When we resurrected the project in late 2017 — at that point — the dataset had grown to fifteen thousand eight hundred and forty six rows and detailed the airstrikes from march 2015 to December 2017 — that’s twenty-eight months of airstrike data. Then we got another updated version that recorded the air strikes till March 2018 — this meant we were working with thirty three months of airstrike data </p><p>To supplement the datasets me and some colleagues scraped the geospatial coordinates for the governorates as well as the last recorded population. This meant we could now locate the air strike data on a map over three years. In all honesty we could possibly have stopped then… that in itself was a compelling story. But we didn’t.</p><p>I then located and added satellite imagery of specific sites that had been bombed.</p><p>This was an important visual to remind us as well as the user that the numbers in the dataset are about real people and real places.</p><p>If you haven’t noticed — I struggled with being the de facto dataset expert, managing the project while being the designer and working on the data visualisations. </p><p>Within the narrative itself I wanted to include smaller bite sized graphics. These visualisations were largely two pages of content which I distilled and placed into excel which then allowed me to make two visualisations.</p><p>The first recorded the kind of arms and armaments sold by the U.S. and the financial gains involved with that.</p><p>This visual was important to show how lucrative the conflict in Yemen was for the U.S. economy and that it wasn’t just some naive misplaced trust in coalition leaders.</p><p>The second interactive graphic gave a more detailed view of the number of air strikes on civilian sites from 2015 to 2018, showing periods when the air raids were exceptionally aggressive.</p><p>The story was built on Shorthand, and once I managed to get enough of the data cleaned the visual language began to take shape.</p><p>The narrative was largely about U.S. policy towards Yemen and that detailed very much the visual language, graphics, colours, typeface and photographs…</p><p>This piece is going to be a work in progress.

Our experiences in this area over the past two years informs a new joint publication, which provides an extended introduction to the intricacies of local governance in the country.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/BF_Local_Governance_in_Yemen__2019.pdf"><em>Local Governance in Yemen: Theory, Practice and Future Options</em></a></span> summarises the key legal texts on local governance since the early 2000s and discusses how they were implemented (or not) prior to and since the current war broke out in 2015. Alongside the legal framework and its implementation, it examines how local administrations have coped with falling revenues and uses case studies of Dhamar, Hadhramawt, and Marib governorates to capture some of the details and diversity of current practice. The paper also outlines Yemeni actors’ current thinking on what is needed to sustain and improve local governance and contribute to an end to the fighting.</p><p>Over the course of intensive consultations with high-level Yemeni political actors, the Berghof Foundation has helped to develop local governance options for the post-agreement period. Overall, there is consensus that local authorities need more far-ranging powers and authorities but that they must also operate within an agreed framework that reserves key sovereign powers for the central government. More specifically, such future options could include the following possibilities.</p><p>[…], local governance structures in Yemen remain central for the political process and for the stability of Yemen; indeed, they have taken on critical importance. The governorates are now the main level of government able and willing to provide services in much of the country, and the only level of government able to do so with a measure of responsiveness to citizen needs and civil society demands. Throughout much of Yemen, the governorates have become the de-facto site of political and sometimes military authority.</p><p>If the war continues, effective local governance will be one of the few mechanisms available to address the urgent needs of Yemen’s inhabitants and to keep further fragmentation and security competition at bay.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.berghof-foundation.org/en/news-article/local-governance-in-yemen-the-devil-is-in-the-detail/">https://www.berghof-foundation.org/en/news-article/local-governance-in-yemen-the-devil-is-in-the-detail/</a></span> = <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/local-governance-yemen-theory-practice-and-future-options">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/local-governance-yemen-theory-practice-and-future-options</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p><p><strong>[Sanaa] Health Ministry: 60 Thousand Patients Suffer Due to Lack of Stents, Valves, Catheters</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Public Health and Population warned of the lack of stents and heart catheters in all governorates, threatening the lives of thousands of heart patients.

The Gulf monarchy has been busy building military bases, installing communications networks, and carrying out other development projects, along with its purchase of thousands of hectares of private land from local residents. The expansion has been supervised by two UAE emirs (princes), Abu Mubarak Khalfan bin Mubarak Al Mazroui and Mahmoud Fath Ali Al Khaja.</p><p>Just as it did in the Yemeni mainland’s southern districts, the UAE managed to secure Socotra by winning the support of local residents, likely a welcome reprieve from Saudi Arabia’s habit of trying to bomb Yemeni residents into submission. UAE officials have offered Socotri islanders healthcare, work permits in Abu Dhabi, organized cultural events and group weddings, and have even granted UAE nationality to tribal chiefs and important social figures on the Island.</p><p>One high-ranking UAE official recently told a gathering of dignitaries on the island that Socotra will be part of the UAE. He said — perched in front of large images of his country’s leaders, including Mohammed bin Zayed — that “citizenship will be granted to all of the island’s sons and this is a foregone conclusion.”</p><p>Considering its strategic location in the Arabian Sea, Socotra could help the UAE expand its global trade routes to states such as India, with which it has growing ties, and to the Horn of Africa, in which it seeks greater military and economic hegemony. Aside from its strategic value, the island has become a source of contention between the UAE and its Saudi allies, who have their own ambitions for Socotra.</p><p>Socotra’s 60,000 inhabitants have lived in relative harmony with each other and with nature for thousands of years, but last week clashes broke out between local residents who call themselves the “Security Belt in the Port of Socotra” and UAE military forces. The island is now part of the ongoing struggle between local residents who back Saudi Arabia and those prefer the UAE.</p><p>The UAE’s military and political presence on the island — along with that of its biggest partner in the Yemen war, Saudi Arabia — exposes Socotra’s unique natural environment to unpredictable geopolitical interferences such as those that have already occurred in Mahra, Yemen’s remote easternmost governorate.</p><p>Like many paramilitary forces born from the Saudi-led Coalition in Yemen, the Security Belt in the Port of Socotra was formed from members of specific tribes, not on the basis of one national army for the country as a whole — exacerbating tribal differences and reviving the desire for revenge among tribes and new ambitions for autonomy.</p><p>Local activists told MintPress that the UAE has transformed the island into a military outpost-cum-holiday resort. Socotra’s UNESCO-protected plants and animals, they say, are being transformed into another Abu Dhabi. Even the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/socotra-yemen-biodiversity-photography/">dragon’s blood tree</a> — a unique tree with crimson resin and a dense crown of leaves, a beloved symbol of the island — is now threatened.</p><p>“When I tell relatives and friends that we should take to the streets to reject the Emiratis and preserve our Yemeni identity, they ask me why? … Our lives could be better with the Emiratis,” al-Socotri huffs. His words echo those of the many patriots who reject their island’s occupation, whatever the temptations.</p><p>There is not much in the way of a unified domestic opposition to the UAE’s occupation. What remains has by and large been led by the Islah Party, former ally of the UAE that has organized protests against Socotra’s occupation. The UAE usually responds to the protests by partially withdrawing from portions of the island — a tactic that has been effective in soothing the wrath of the protesters — and then successfully consolidating its links with leaders of the island.</p><p>In the wake of last week’s clashes, “a minister of state” in Socotra’s Coalition-formed local government, Maj.

But Iranian support for the Houthis has become a self-fulfilling prophecy as the war has continued, and the Houthis’ likely war crimes are no reason for the Saudi-led coalition not to be held accountable for its own violations.</p><p>As a long-standing observer of UK arms export policy, one particular element of the Court of Appeal’s decision interests me.

Ein Computer soll nun vorhersagen, wo sie als Nächstes zuschlagen wird. Gewinnen Mediziner so erstmals die Oberhand?</p><p>Der Krieg verschärft das Cholera-Problem</p><p>All das gilt auch für den Jemen. Doch in dem Land am Südzipfel der Arabischen Halbinsel kommt noch ein weiterer typischer Faktor hinzu: menschengemachte Krisen. »Cholera ist eine Krankheit, die mit Armut zu tun hat – mit mangelhaftem Zugang zu Sanitäranlagen und zu sicherem Trinkwasser. Der Bürgerkrieg im Jemen verstärkt solche Faktoren natürlich noch zusätzlich«, erläutert Colwell. </p><p>Doch für UNICEF und andere Hilfsorganisationen ist es wie beim Hasen und dem Igel: Wann immer sie zur Bekämpfung ansetzten, war die Cholera bereits dort.</p><p>Ein Prognosemodell könnte das ändern, hofft Colwell. Gemeinsam mit ihrem Team feilt sie inzwischen seit Jahrzehnten an ihrem Modell, um immer genauer und für immer größere Zeitspannen vorherzusagen, wo der nächste Krankheitsausbruch stattfinden wird. Im Mittelpunkt stand dabei der Golf von Bengalen. </p><p>Im Januar 2018 erhielten Colwell und Jutla einen Anruf von der staatlichen britischen Entwicklungshilfeagentur Department for International Development (DFID). »Sie hatten über unsere Arbeit im <span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/satellites-predict-a-cholera-outbreak-weeks-in-advance/">›Scientific American‹</a></span> gelesen und wollten wissen, ob unsere Algorithmen auch auf andere Weltregionen übertragbar wären. Sie waren schon im Jemen tätig, und wir hatten genau die Computermodelle, die sie brauchten«, berichtet Antar Jutla. Im Mai 2018 fand schließlich ein Test statt – und obwohl der Algorithmus anhand von Daten aus Asien und Afrika entwickelt worden war, gelang es ihm, einen Ausbruch im Jemen zu prognostizieren, der im Juni dann auch tatsächlich stattfand.</p><p>Seitdem koordiniert das DFID den Erfahrungsaustausch und Wissenstransfer zwischen den amerikanischen Wissenschaftlern, der UNICEF und Met Office, dem britischen meteorologischen Dienst. Dank dieser Zusammenarbeit stehen den Forschern nun auch die gewaltigen Datenmengen des Met-Office-Supercomputers in Exeter zur Verfügung</p><p>Trefferquote: 92 Prozent</p><p>Ticehurst berichtet, wie das amerikanische Modell mit den Daten des britischen Computers Vorhersagen auf einer Karte des Jemen präsentiert. Auf dieser Karte ist der Jemen in Raster von jeweils vier Quadratkilometern aufgeteilt. Jedes Raster wird dann mit Farbwerten für Niederschlag, Wärme und andere meteorologische Daten versehen. Das ist für Laien nicht einfach zu lesen, doch das Met Office hilft: »Mit Hilfe dieser Karte formulieren unsere Experten dann schriftliche Anweisungen für die Einsatzgruppen der UNICEF«, sagt Ticehurst. </p><p>Diese Gruppen werden dann in jene Verwaltungsdistrikte des Landes geschickt, wo Regen und andere Faktoren dem Algorithmus zufolge Cholera-Ausbrüche erwarten lassen. Dort verteilen sie Pakete mit Material für bessere Hygiene sowie Chlortabletten zur Säuberung von verseuchtem Wasser, und sie erklären den Menschen, wie sie eine Ansteckung vermeiden können.</p><p>Bislang lag das Computermodell mit seinen Vorhersagen zu 92 Prozent richtig. Während 2017 in den schlimmsten Wochen bis zu 50 000 neue Cholera-Erkrankungen im Jemen registriert wurden, kam es in der ersten Jahreshälfte 2018 pro Woche nur noch auf etwas über 2000 neue Fälle, selbst wenn es regnete – von Roman Goergen</p><p><span><a href="https://www.spektrum.de/news/mit-dem-algorithmus-gegen-cholera/1655968">https://www.spektrum.de/news/mit-dem-algorithmus-gegen-cholera/1655968</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/who">World Health Organization</a></span>: Outbreak update - Cholera in Yemen, 16 June 2019</p><p>The Ministry of Public Health and Population of Yemen reported 20,264 suspected cases of cholera with 15 associated deaths during epidemiological week 24 (10 to 16 June) of 2019, with 14% of cases reported as severe.

As for the role of Russia, it is almost isolated from Yemen because of its concern with the issue of Crimea and Syria and has priorities on these issues.</p><p>It depends on diplomatic bodies, but perhaps these bodies are not functioning or are under the influence and pressure of Western diplomatic bodies.</p><p>The Deputy Minister of Information of the Houthis Government of Yemen, Fahmi al-Yussafi, spoke about this specifically for World Geostrategic Insights.</p><p>Mr. Al-Yussafi noted that the states of the Arab coalition acting against Yemen, when they declare something for which they are not responsible, use the media to mislead and blacken the commission of crimes prohibited at the international level. And this experience is the greatest evidence in five years of continuing aggression against Yemen.

The United States later became the Saudis’ primary Western protector, but the UK’s role has remained pivotal.</p><p>British jets now comprise a significant proportion of the Royal Saudi Air Force. Each deal has also involved Britain supplying the services, components and ammunition necessary to keep the fleets operational. The Saudi war effort in Yemen <span><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/britain-war-in-yemen">effectively depends on British support</a></span>. Its removal would seriously weaken the bombing campaign. </p><p>The motivation for the government’s failure to assess past Saudi actions is clear: the UK arms industry stands to benefit, and Whitehall gets a strategic ally in the region. The consequences of the judgment last week could spell a sea change. </p><p>And if the past behaviour of potential recipients of British arms is a legal barrier to future exports, then the UK arms industry has a major problem on its hands. A large and growing proportion of these exports flow to regimes that abuse human rights, with sales to Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf now accounting for nearly half of total UK arms exports</p><p>There is a widespread misconception that arms exports are of great economic benefit to the UK. </p><p>The real value of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, from Whitehall’s point of view, is that they tie the UK closely to a strategic ally, and sustain the domestic arms industry that Britain needs if it wants to remain a global military power. Last week’s court judgment places a vital question mark over this longstanding tenet of UK foreign policy.

Nowadays, Yemeni coffee exports account for less than 1% of global production. </p><p>Despite being eclipsed in volume by other coffee-producing countries, Yemen’s impact on coffee culture and the <a href="https://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2016/11/bourbon-caturra-varietal-why-care/">coffee varieties</a> we enjoy today can’t be understated. There’s a chance the coffee you drank this morning could trace its lineage to a plant that grew in Yemen hundreds of years ago.</p><p>Moreover, coffee is still of great importance for many rural Yemeni communities. Producers are working to overcome economic and security challenges stemming from the civil war. Yet some of them are also earning much-needed income by providing coffee connoisseurs with beans with distinctive, complex flavours.</p><p>Starting in 1536, the majority of coffees consumed across Europe and modern-day Turkey were brewed from beans grown exclusively in Yemen. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2019/06/tracing-coffees-roots-back-to-al-mokha-yemen/">https://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2019/06/tracing-coffees-roots-back-to-al-mokha-yemen/</a></span></p><p>(-)</p><p>Photo: Yemeni village</p><p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=593517154504491&amp;set=a.589853591537514&amp;type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=593517154504491&amp;set=a.589853591537514&amp;type=3&amp;theater</a></span></p><p>(* A )</p><p>Photos: Swarms of locusts fly in Sanaa, Yemen</p><p><span><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1155761.shtml">http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1155761.shtml</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vorige / Previous:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-549-yemen-war-mosaic-549">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-549-yemen-war-mosaic-549</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 1-549 / Yemen War Mosaic 1-549:</span></h2><p><span><a href="/autoren/dklose">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose</a> oder / or <a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Der saudische Luftkrieg im Bild / Saudi aerial war images:</span></h2><p><span>(18 +, Nichts für Sensible!) / (18 +; Graphic!)</span></p><p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/">http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://www.yemenwar.info/">http://www.yemenwar.info/</a> </span></p><p><span>und alle Liste aller Luftangriffe / and list of all air raids:</span></p><p><span><a href="http://yemendataproject.org/data/">http://yemendataproject.org/data/</a></span></p></div>
