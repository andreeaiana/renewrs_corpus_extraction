A Misleading Withdrawal From the Emirates</strong></p><p>The United Arab Emirates has announced the withdrawal of its forces from Yemen. But behind the statements, there is a desire to find a new strategy to emerge from an endless war, which is not without tensions with the Saudi ally.</p><p>Once again military developments have brought Yemen back to western headlines: the “withdrawal” of Emirati forces, fighting in Aden pitting separatist forces against those of President Hadi’s internationally recognised government, and increasingly frequent Huthi missile attacks on Saudi Arabian strategic locations. These are all taking place against the background of worsening tensions and dangerous confrontation between the <span>US</span>, the <span>UK</span> and their Gulf Arab allies on one side and Iran on the other. In the case of Yemen, reality is somewhat different from appearances as discussed below.</p><p>THE ABU DHABI STRATEGY</p><p>This is not the first time the <span>UAE</span> has signalled its wish to end its military involvement in the Yemeni conflict. Announced in July, the withdrawal of most of its national military and materiel had taken place earlier, particularly in the Tihama whose main city, Hodeida, has been the focus of international attention since mid-2017. Future fighting will be left to the different (competing) Yemeni and Sudanese groups deployed there. This primarily political move has number of implications: first, at least for now, the coalition has abandoned the plan to remove Hodeida from Huthi control and turn it into another potential “temporary capital” of the country. Military attacks on Hodeida were interrupted at the end of last year by <span>UN</span>efforts to prevent a worsening of the disastrous humanitarian crisis. The December 2018 <span>UN</span>-sponsored Stockholm Agreement (between the Huthis and Hadi’s government) means that it is now politically extremely difficult for the coalition to resume the offensive thanks to a very small international presence from the <span>UN</span> Mission to support the Hodeida Agreement (<span>UNMHA</span>) established by the Security Council in January 2019.</p><p>Taking Hodeida was the coalition military strategy to end the three-year stalemate. Abandoning it requires a new approach which has not emerged either from the Saudi leadership or Hadi’s government. <span>UAE</span> official withdrawal is an explicit appeal for a new strategy. In any case, the Emiratis can return anytime, should they so decide.</p><p>THE CRISIS IN ADEN, THE “TEMPORARY CAPITAL”</p><p>Whether or not the Emiratis had advance knowledge and endorsed the <span>STC</span> “take over” of Aden, its outcome serves Emirati strategic objectives. In Yemen, <span>UAE</span> phobia for Muslim Brothers translates into undiluted hostility to Islah, an issue on which it differs with its Saudi ally, which focuses on the northern tribal element of Islah and supports its involvement in government while the <span>UAE</span> sees only its hated “Muslim Brother” component. In addition to encouraging the assassination of numerous Islahi militants by its southern allies, the <span>UAE</span> has arguably been at least as active combating Islah as in fighting the far more extreme Islamists of <span>AQAP</span> and Daesh, in addition to its explicit support for Security Belts and other Salafi militias.</p><p>Despite its “coup” in Aden, the <span>STC</span> has not challenged <span>UAE</span> authority by declaring southern independence, despite demands from its supporters. It is too dependent on the <span>UAE</span> to risk such a move, opposed by the <span>UAE</span> to maintain its good relations with Saudi Arabia.Without demanding <span>STC</span> withdrawal, the <span>UAE</span> leadership supports the emergency summit called by Saudi Arabia, which is delayed by new fighting east of Aden (in Abyan and Shabwa governorates) as well as incompatible conditions put by the parties for their attendance.</p><p>HUTHI ATTACKS ON SAUDI ARABIA</p><p>UNITY UNDER THREAT</p><p>Recent events in Aden have revived debate on the possible fragmentation of Yemen often explained by a “southern specificity”. </p><p>So disintegration, comparable to Somalia, is a real possibility and a main reason why a federal Yemen would be a sensible solution to avoid the re-creation of resourceless microstates, a model which only works in the <span>UAE</span> thanks to Abu Dhabi’s willingness to finance the poorer emirates. In Yemen, lack of resources precludes this option. However the federated regions need to be defined on the basis of social cohesion, economic resources and potential, as well as political solidarity, rather than on bureaucratically defined governorate borders.</p><p><span>UN</span> FAILURE</p><p>UNCERTAIN STRATEGIES</p><p>The new <span>UAE</span> strategy does not necessarily mean a breach in the deep relationship which binds the Emirati and Saudi Crown Princes, effective rulers of their respective states, but it has certainly brought to the fore their strategic divergences. <span>UAE</span> “withdrawal” attempts to bring about a review of Saudi strategy. Whether it succeeds or not remains to be seen, largely because coalition options are limited by the nature and “legitimacy” of Hadi and his government, which also constrains <span>UN</span> actions. The next steps will be the proposed emergency summit and the reshuffle of the Hadi government which has been further weakened by recent events, both seem likely be delayed.</p><p>Internal Yemeni developments are at the heart of the matter: regardless of <span>UAE</span> or Saudi wishes, there are only three major significant political groupings in Yemen: Ansar Allah in the Huthi controlled part of the country and the other two are present throughout the country: former President Saleh’s General People’s Congress (<span>GPC</span>) which, like most Yemeni organisations, is currently fragmented between those remaining in Sana’a under Huthi control, independents in exile, and factions loosely aligned with President Hadi. Some of its senior leaders have, in recent months, been involved in discussions with the Saudi and Emirati leaderships and may develop a stronger presence in the internationally recognised government which has, up to now, been characterised by weak representation of the multiplicity of Yemeni political and social forces. The other is Islah which remains a coherent and significant political force in Yemen, whether one likes it or not – by Helen Lackner</p><p><span><a href="https://orientxxi.info/magazine/the-yemen-war-impact-of-recent-developments,3253">https://orientxxi.info/magazine/the-yemen-war-impact-of-recent-developments,3253</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>A life or death battle for Yemen's Aden</strong></p><p>Drastic changes are taking place in Aden as deadly fighting rages on for control of the city where the situation remains volatile. </p><p>The fighting between the government and the separatists, seen as a civil war within Yemen's already complex conflict, has sparked fears the country could break apart unless a peace deal is forged soon.</p><p>Analysts say the fight for the south is a key test for Saudi Arabia, which hopes to mediate a ceasefire so it can focus on its main mission: battling the Houthi rebels who captured the capital Sanaa in 2014.</p><p>Long the Arab world's poorest nation, Yemen is now split along two fronts after years of conflict that has left tens of thousands of people dead and pushed the country to the brink of famine.</p><p>"The Security Belt force completely controls the city of Aden along with its entrances," Haitham Nezar, a spokesman for the pro-independence Southern Transitional Council, told AFP on Thursday morning.<br /> A government security source confirmed Aden was under the full control of the STC, saying government troops who had entered parts of the city the day before "withdrew from Aden" to the nearby Abyan province.<br /> "It's total chaos here. There was fighting in the city all day yesterday. Things appear to have calmed down a bit this morning, but we expect the hostilities to resume at any point," said MSF programme manager for Yemen Caroline Seguin, who is in Aden. In the space of a few hours, Médecins Sans Frontières said their teams had admitted 51 wounded casualties. Ten were dead on arrival. </p><p>Aden is seen as the backbone of both parties in the ongoing fight between the internationally recognised government and the UAE-backed separatists. If the government loses Aden, it implicitly means that it has lost its legitimacy.</p><p>According to the Yemeni government, Aden is now the temporary capital and the capital of all Yemenis, as Yemen’s capital Sanaa is still under the Houthi control.</p><p>The southern separatists see Aden as the capital of the southern state which they struggle to establish. If the separatists lose Aden, their popularity will decline and their influence will be wiped out.</p><p>Such a reality makes the battle to Aden a matter of life and death for both parties.</p><p>So where does this leave Saudi Arabia and the UAE?</p><p>Saudi Arabia and the UAE have lately issued a joint statement, urging peace talks between the government and the separatists.</p><p>The two major countries in the Arab coalition have been trying to appear united on Yemen’s developments, but their schism now speaks for itself. At a time when Saudi thinkers and writers on social media platforms slam the southern separatists, Emiratis have shown opposite orientations.<br /> Observers say the break between the government and the separatists reflects a wider rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which has trained and supported the separatists despite being part of the coalition.<br /> Matters seem to have escalated further on August 29 when Yemen's government accused the UAE of launching airstrikes against its troops in the southern city of Aden in support of the separatists fighters. Dozens were reported to have been killed. </p><p>Saudi and Emirati leaders seem to try to maintain their differences as covert as possible but the ongoing rift between them has been conspicuous. Yemen’s war has tested their relation and partnership and it has proved that Saudi Arabia and UAE are just friends, but not genuine friends. </p><p>Saudi Arabia's 'new Yemen policy'</p><p>The abrupt rise of the internationally recognised government seems to show that Saudi Arabia has ceased ignoring the Emirati agenda in Yemen’s south. Essentially, the Yemeni government's patience with the UAE has run out.</p><p>Abdulmalik Al-Mekhalfi, an adviser to internationally recognised Yemeni President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi and a former foreign affairs minister, said such developments have cemented the Yemeni government's trust in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The blocking stone removed </p><p>Multitudes of Yemenis believe that the UAE has been a blocking stone in the road to peace in Yemen. <br /> Its support for the separatist forces has destabilised the south and this has kept the north under the control of the Houthis. <br /> The behaviour of the UAE in Yemen has tarnished its reputation and has been <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-yemen-president-says-uae-acting-occupiers">viewed</a></span> as an occupier.</p><p>Over the last three days of fighting in Shabwa, Abyan and Aden, the pro-government fighters released video footages in which they appeared to bring down Emirati flags or big pictures of Emirati leaders, placing them under their feet.</p><p>The UAE has run out of rationale justifications for its anti-government and anti-Yemen’s unity behaviour in the south. It has been training and funding the separatist groups in a way that undermines the authority of the Yemeni government.</p><p>However, the UAE claims it is fighting the terrorist groups in the south while its southern loyal fighters say they are fighting the Muslim Brotherhood represented by the Yemeni Islah Party. <br /> These claims have now become irrational and invalid because the agenda of dividing Yemen has been crystal clear.</p><p>In case Yemen is divided into two states, north and south, the UAE would benefit as the secessionists will pledge allegiance. Also, it does not share any border with the Houthi-controlled north which makes it safe from any Houthi incursions, missiles and drones, unlike neighbouring Saudi Arabia who will bear the consequences. </p><p>With the UAE is gone from Yemen’s south or at least weakened, the position of the Yemeni government will be stronger – by a Yemeni journalist</p><p><span><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2019/8/29/a-life-or-death-battle-for-yemens-aden">https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2019/8/29/a-life-or-death-battle-for-yemens-aden</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Jemen: Es droht der Krieg im Krieg</strong></p><p>Mit der neuesten Eskalation in Aden droht der Südjemen zu implodieren. Eine umsetzbare Lösung der Konflikte ist kaum in Aussicht. Wegen des Zerbrechens regionaler Bündnisse verschärft sich die Lage im Jemen weiter.</p><p>Die Hauptakteure hinter dieser Entwicklung sind Milizen aus dem Süden, deren Entschluss, ihre Differenzen mit der Zentralregierung durch Waffengewalt zu klären, die gegenwärtigen Kämpfe auslöste. Es ist ein drastischer und riskanter Schritt, der, soviel ist klar, von langer Hand geplant wurde. Jemens Süden erlebt im Moment eine gezielte Eskalation, die angesichts der politischen Sackgasse, in der er sich seit 2014 befindet, unausweichlich war. Die Konsequenzen dieser Eskalation sind nicht absehbar. Fest steht, dass sie mehr Probleme und noch mehr Chaos für das Land bedeutet.</p><p>In dieser neuen Phase des Krieges löst sich die Anti-Houthi Allianz aus Regierungssoldaten und Milizen aus dem Süden, die sich angesichts des Vormarsches der Houthis geformt hat, auf. Bisher überdeckten die Houthis als gemeinsamer Gegner die Differenzen zwischen den Akteuren, wozu auch die Einflussnahme der saudisch-emiratisch geführten Militärkoalition beitrug. Es war dennoch lediglich eine Zweckallianz, mit der der STC nun öffentlich bricht. Die Gründe liegen aber tiefer, als die zwei Anschläge in Aden.</p><p>Diese Ressentiments des Südens gegenüber dem Norden erklären, warum sich die Wut der Bewohner*innen Adens nach den zwei Anschlägen gegen die Zentralregierung richtete und der Sieg des STC so euphorisch gefeiert wurde. Dahinter stecken tiefe Risse, die bis heute nachwirken und nicht einfach gelöst werden können – insbesondere nachdem der bis dato umfangreichste Versuch kurz nach der Revolution <span><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/27/the-non-conclusion-of-yemens-national-dialogue/">krachend scheiterte</a></span>.</p><p>Bin Breik nutzte die im Süden verbreitete Vorbehalte gegenüber der Islah-Partei als Vorwand, um die Zentralregierung anzugreifen, wofür die zwei Anschläge als willkommene Auslöser dienten. Es ging weder um die Islah-Partei noch um einen Protest gegen die Houthis oder al-Qaida, sondern um eine Machtdemonstration gegenüber der jemenitischen Zentralregierung.</p><p>Bin Breik wusste, dass die Regierungstruppen in Aden seinen Kämpfern unterlegen sind und nutzte die Gelegenheit, um die politische Stellung des STC auszubauen. Mit seiner Einladung nach Dschidda und der damit einhergehenden Anerkennung des STC als politische Organisation durch Saudi-Arabien ist dieser Plan aufgegangen. Bin Breik ist es gelungen, Verhandlungen über den Status des Südjemens zu forcieren – mit sich selbst als zentralem Akteur.</p><p>Bei einem weiteren Erfolg in Shabwa könnte sich der STC innerhalb weniger Wochen an die Spitze südjemenitischer Bestrebungen setzen und sich innerhalb der Bewegung profilieren. Schon jetzt ist sie die prominenteste Organisation Südjemens, ohne allerdings die einzige oder militärisch schlagkräftigste zu sein. Tatsächlich lehnen Teile der Südbewegung den STC ab, was zu einer Zersplitterung des Südens führen könnte, sollten sich die Kämpfe ausweiten.</p><p>Was die Konstellation im Südjemen so komplex macht, ist der lokale Ansatz, den die Emiratis im Aufbauen der Milizen verfolgten, weswegen diese hauptsächlich in bestimmten Provinzen vertreten sind. Dadurch ist ein vielschichtiges Geflecht mehrerer Milizen gewachsen, die lediglich eine lose Identität als Südjemeniten miteinander teilen und nicht unbedingt <span><a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/yemens-southern-powder-keg">die gleichen Ziele</a></span> haben.</p><p>Das erhöht das Eskalationspotenzial und könnte den Süden des Landes in kleinere Teilgebiete, kontrolliert von einzelnen Milizen zersplittern lassen, die um Einfluss und Territorien mit sich selbst und der Regierung konkurrieren</p><p>Die Situation im Südjemen ist insofern schon seit längerem angespannt, weswegen die Ereignisse in Aden sich ankündigten und am Ende nur der Auftakt für eine weitere Verschärfung der Kriegszustände sein könnten. Ein großes Problem ist dabei, dass die internationale Gemeinschaft den Süden ignoriert hat </p><p>Es ist dabei kein Zufall, dass der STC ausgerechnet jetzt beschlossen hat, gegen die Regierung vorzugehen und die generelle Lage im Süden eskaliert. Das hängt mit zwei Entwicklungen zusammen.</p><p>Einerseits waren viele Südmilizen an den Fronten gegen die Houthis beschäftigt und kämpften mit Regierung und Islah-treuen Einheiten zusammen. Im Dezember 2018 wurde allerdings das <span><a href="https://www.disorient.de/blog/jemen-ueberfaelliges-lebenszeichen-aber-nur-ein-erster-schritt">Stockholm-Abkommens</a></span> zwischen Regierung und Houthis ausgehandelt, das die Demobilisierung der, bis vor kurzem, größten Front im Krieg an der Stadt Houdeida vorsieht. Obwohl noch nicht umgesetzt, stärkt das Abkommen Vermutungen im Süden, dass sich Regierung und Houthis gegen sie verschwören.</p><p>Diese Angst vor einem Komplott des Nordens waren auch nach den zwei Anschlägen in Aden sichtbar.</p><p>Der große Gewinner sind die Houthis, die weiterhin die stärkste Kraft im Land bleiben. Wenn Südmilizen ihre Zusammenarbeit mit der Regierung herunterfahren oder sich gegenseitig bekriegen, werden die Houthis militärisch praktisch ohne ernsthafte Konkurrenz sein – von Parham Kouloubandi</p><p><span><a href="https://www.disorient.de/blog/jemen-es-droht-der-krieg-im-krieg">https://www.disorient.de/blog/jemen-es-droht-der-krieg-im-krieg</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp2/2 Allgemein / General</span></h2><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>The UAE is weakening its partnership with the Saudis in Yemen. Here’s why that matters.</p><p>In the complicated, brutal war to control Yemen, there’s been a crack in a critical alliance. Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi’s government has been surviving in part because of backing from the Saudi Arabia-led Arab Coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates (UAE). But that’s now in doubt.</p><p>Here’s the background</p><p>UAE troop withdrawal</p><p>In other words, by removing its military from Hodeidah, the UAE is backing away from Saudi Arabia and the United States’ hard-line opposition to <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the-uaes-ambitions-backfire-as-it-finds-itself-on-the-front-line-of-us-iran-tensions/2019/08/11/d3ee41a0-509d-11e9-bdb7-44f948cc0605_story.html">Iran</a></span>. In doing so, the UAE is signaling to Iran that it wants diplomacy instead of military confrontation <span><a href="https://lobelog.com/the-uae-and-irans-maritime-talks/">in the Strait of Hormuz</a></span> between the two countries.</p><p>What’s more, with UAE troops out of Aden, Abu Dhabi could act as a bystander when the STC — its proxies — pushed the Hadi-government forces out of the city. The violence was triggered by an attack on STC-loyal forces the day after a UAE-delegation visit to Tehran that was claimed by the Iranian-backed Houthis. Nevertheless, the STC began its attacks against the Hadi government, arguing that his government was behind the attack.</p><p>A fragmented south</p><p>In 2016, to reestablish a sense of order in Aden, the UAE began to build up what became known as the Security Belt Force, which included recruits from the southern resistance. Formally under the command of Yemen’s government, the belt forces were widely recognized as state forces loyal to the southern separatist movement. By supporting the belt forces, the UAE empowered forces seeking an independent south.</p><p>To please the UAE, Hadi included members of the southern independence movement in local government around Aden. As a result, members of the movement became empowered to establish the STC in May 2017 to represent the south.</p><p>In January 2018, the <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/30/yemens-saudi-backed-government-to-flee-from-aden">STC had already challenged the government</a></span> when their UAE-supported forces took control of nearly all of Aden and its military camps from Hadi’s government. </p><p>Undecided power struggle</p><p>By supporting the STC, the UAE is risking its partnership with Saudi Arabia. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE present themselves as a united front, but the Riyadh-based support for Hadi pressures the UAE from his Riyadh exile to demonstrate its genuine commitment to the Arab coalition’s goals in Yemen.

In this context, a Confederate State would be a "valid" solution if the parties "were able to draw up a balanced and just Constitution, respecting the legitimate expectations of tribal and regional actors". But to achieve the goal, he warns, we need "the ability to accept reasonable compromises".</p><p>Any agreements, he warns, will be possible "only in a minimum climate of trust", in which "even the external powers" help to heal the country "instead of destabilizing it". The hopes of a short truce are few because too many aspects "are largely out of control" and “the civilian population is fighting against violence, disease and hunger", while the international community "does not know how to react. And stands by silent ", but this silence "could prove fatal".</p><p><span><a href="http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Vicar-of-Arabia%3A-confused-situation-and-risk-of-division-in-Yemen-47826.html">http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Vicar-of-Arabia%3A-confused-situation-and-risk-of-division-in-Yemen-47826.html</a></span></p><p>(* B P)</p><p>Saudi-UAE rift in Yemen further endangers Yemenis</p><p>The deepening rift between the UAE and Saudi Arabia in Yemen threatens to make the war in Yemen even messier.</p><p>The big players watched the smaller ones fight each other and did not interfere until the game was over. Perhaps the failure to realise that entering Yemen was from the beginning a colossal mistake that would only create the mess we see today. </p><p>What started as a 10-nation coalition is now more divided than at any other time. The Yemeni government has no doubt noticed the tension; likely, it can be seen on the ground. That is probably why it has asked President Hadi to expel the UAE from the coalition. The fact that UAE appears to be thinking increasingly about its interests rather than those of the coalition poses a threat to Hadi’s government. But does Hadi have enough authority to expel the UAE from the coalition? Maybe not. </p><p>The government’s request to expel Abu Dhabi can also be looked at as a demonstration of its loyalty to Riyadh. "It shows that President Hadi is beholden to Saudi Arabia for political and economic support,” Gregory Aftandilian, a lecturer at Boston University’s Pardee School of Global Studies and a former US State Department Middle East analyst, told me. </p><p>“Even though [Hadi] is originally a ‘southerner,’ [he] is strongly opposed to [the] Southern Transitional Council and its attempts to create a separate state,” the non-resident fellow at Arab Center Washington DC added.</p><p>President Hadi is aware that what happened in Aden can be repeated in other areas, and therefore, his influence will only decrease. </p><p>“Sounds to me as if the coalition is coming apart over the issue of southern secession,” Professor Daniel Serwer, director of the Conflict Management and American Foreign Policy Programs at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told me. </p><p>“If that happens, it will significantly weaken Hadi's position, as the southern forces are important to the fight.”</p><p>It is clear that Abu Dhabi, in one way or another, pushed Riyadh into entering a war that has become one of the world’s gravest humanitarian crisis. However, what is happening in Aden exposes how the UAE turned its back on Riyadh for the sake of pursuing its agenda. </p><p>Although Saudi Arabia called for talks after the battle in Aden was over, these talks are unlikely to succeed. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/saudi-uae-rift-in-yemen-further-endangers-yemenis-29293">https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/saudi-uae-rift-in-yemen-further-endangers-yemenis-29293</a></span></p><p><span>(* A P)</span></p><p>Saudi Arabia, UAE Stress Continued Efforts to Save Yemen under Hadi Leadership</p><p>Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reiterated on Monday their continued efforts to aid the Yemeni people, denouncing the smear campaign against the UAE over the recent developments in the war-torn country.<br /> In a joint statement, their foreign ministries said the Arab coalition forces have made great sacrifices in Yemen out of sincere brotherly ties, saying Riyadh and Abu Dhabi seek to preserve Yemen and its territorial integrity under the leadership of legitimate President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi.<br /> “The governments of both countries express their rejection and condemnation of the accusations and defamation campaigns targeting the UAE” in wake of the unrest in the interim capital, Aden, and the governorates of Abyan and Shabwa.<br /> They “reminded everyone of the sacrifices made by the Coalition forces in Yemen, motivated by sincere fraternal and neighborly ties, the preservation of security in the region and the prosperity of its people and their common destiny,” read a statement carried by the UAE news agency (WAM).<br /> They also renewed their commitment to continue confronting the terrorist Iran-backed Houthi militias and all terrorist organizations in Yemen.</p><p><span><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1872761/saudi-arabia-uae-stress-continued-efforts-save-yemen-under-hadi-leadership">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1872761/saudi-arabia-uae-stress-continued-efforts-save-yemen-under-hadi-leadership</a></span></p><p>and the statement in full: <span><a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=1961835">https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=1961835</a></span></p><p>My comment: This will be Saudi wishful thinking; the UAE will not abandon ist Yemeni proxies.

While the Southern Transitional Council has established security and local governance arrangements in Aden, there has been escalation in other governorates, notably in Shabwah and Abyan. In parallel there has been an intensification of ISIS and AQ attacks in recent weeks against the Southern people.<br /> Our focus since the brutal attacks against the South from 1 August has been to protect civilians and restore stability. It was this intent that led to the STC’s acceptance to take part in a dialogue process in Jeddah with the Hadi government under the guidance of Saudi Arabia. The STC went into those talks without any preconditions, viable policy options to generate confidence building measures, and an overall constructive negotiating approach. In stark contrast the Hadi government refused to engage in the process in Jeddah, and instead on the ground, escalated the situation in Shabwah governorate. This escalation has included credible reports of the role of extremist fighters from both ISIS and AQAP being active on the ground. Against this backdrop the STC welcomes the ceasefire initiative by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. As we have informed our Coalition partners, the STC remains fully focused on de-escalation.<br /> The ceasefire arrangement offers a small window of opportunity to bring back all efforts towards a political solution. In this regard, the STC renews its commitment to a UN-led political track and we call on our international partners to redouble their efforts in support of a comprehensive credible political process to address the Southern issue and, by extension, the Yemeni crisis. The STC has been consistent in its constructive engagement with UN Envoy Martin Griffiths in order to secure a genuine political solution that stands the best chance of success.</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/13138">http://en.adenpress.news/news/13138</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Shatara: Attempt to seize Aden doomed to fail</p><p>Member of the Presidency of the Southern Transitional Council, Lutfi Shatara said that What happened in Aden yesterday was a failed attempt to bring down the city from the inside by the legitimate government with the support of Arab mass media coverage that created a state of frustration.<br /> Shatara wrote on his Facebook account that "the STC leadership and southern forces managed to take the initiative and turn the situation upside down."</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/13139">http://en.adenpress.news/news/13139</a></span></p><p>(A P)</p><p>Film: Battle of Aden about to intensify between Southerners &amp; Hadi Gov forces.

This order reportedly has led to severe protest and unrest amongst the Islah militias in the area.</p><p>Following this, the head of the so-called Department of Moral Guidance of the Tihama Resistance, Wajayd al-Haqei, has accused the UAE of trying to “punish” the militia because it did not want to submit to Tariq Afash.</p><p>“Despite the pressures and threats of the UAE, the resistance led by Abdul Rahman Hajari remains steadfast in its categorical refusal to fight under the leadership of Tariq Afash,” al-Haqei said in a press statement. “The sons of Tihama will not hand over their areas to Tariq Afash.”</p><p>Al-Haqei said that the UAE was putting pressure on the Tihama Resistance, including the suspension of the salaries of more than 3,000 of its forces.</p><p>The Islah Party established the so-called Tihama Resistance in April 2017, to serve as part of the coalition forces on the West Coast, specifically the battles near Hodeidah.

But there is more to the security issue than meets the eye. If they can establish control of security across the south and start to provide services for the public they will have the rudiments of a future state – which is their ultimate goal.</p><p>However, they also have another reason for wanting to take control of security in the south.

This switched the focus of its military strategy from the war against Houthis to a battle against the Yemeni army and legitimacy.<br /> After being allies with the same common goal of fighting Houthi, suddenly, both parties separated by the impact of weapons.<br /> The separation is a declared known desire of the southern components, but it did not reach the extent of military action against the legitimacy of Yemen. Houthis could only sit back and enjoy this gift that was given to them on a silver platter.</p><p>The Transitional Council accuses Yemeni legitimacy of what it called “liquidation of the southern cause.” This is a serious escalation that not only weakened the position of legitimacy, but also the attitude and desire of the southerners to separate from the north in general which is now far from being accepted.<br /> The current military confrontations are known to be between two parties: the Yemeni army belonging to the internationally recognized legitimacy supported by the Arab coalition, and the coup forces aiming at separation. </p><p>The problem with the Southern Council is that it carried out its reckless battle at the wrong time and the wrong place. Everyone rose against it and it became a burden on the upcoming Yemeni state, as well as the international community.<br /> The battle of the “Transitional” exceeded all local, regional, and international facts. Such a coup can't gain legitimacy by taking up arms against the state, regardless of the magnitude of disagreement with it.<br /> This makes it difficult to withdraw power from another coup in the southern regions, as happened with the other one in the northern areas.<br /> Here, it seems as though the same scenario is reoccurring to form a new reality of authority in the south in the interim capital of the country and what it represents of political symbolism.</p><p><span><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1871731/salman-al-dossary/southern-yemenis-and-their-frivolous-battles">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1871731/salman-al-dossary/southern-yemenis-and-their-frivolous-battles</a></span></p><p>My comment: By a Saudi news site; this seems to reflect the Saudi viewpoint.</p><p>(* B P)</p><p>Al-Jabwani: UAE intelligence deceived the kingdom and its withdrawal is a lie and it does not recognize the Republic of Yemen</p><p>Yemen's Transport Minister Saleh al-Jabwani said that since entering Yemen under the umbrella of the Saudi-led Arab coalition, the UAE has been working on an agenda for the establishment of regional, tribal and religious militias, taking advantage of people's eagerness for all those who support them in the face of the Houthi coup militias.</p><p>Al-Jabwani, one of the prominent leaders who confronted the southern transitional government and the UAE during its coup in Aden in early August, added that Abu Dhabi used the president-appointed governors of the leadership of the movement as a cover to pass its agenda, as well as the vice president of the government Khaled Bahah for the same purpose, which forced the president to dismiss them, stressing that the coup, whose repercussions are still going on, is the third targeting legitimacy by planning and financing the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>On the assassination of Abu Al-Yamama, which the coalition considered the beginning of sedition in Aden, al-Jabwani stressed that the UAE was the one who assassinated Abu Al-Yamama to hide its involvement in smuggling weapons and drones equipment to Houthi militias, which the legitimacy agencies had handed over their evidence to the leadership of the coalition and Saudi Arabia, including his signature on the declarations to smuggle aircraft equipment to the area of control of the Houthis.</p><p>Al-Jabwani pointed to the involvement of Hani ben Brik in the assassination of Abu Al-Yamama</p><p><span><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/171036">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/171036</a></span></p><p>(A P)</p><p>Rasd coalition condemns the abduction of the cameraman who works for Yemen Channel, Anwar Laglaf by the Shabwanis Elite armed group in <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/shabwa?src=hash">#shabwa</a></span>.
