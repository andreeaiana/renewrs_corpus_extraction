This review presents the achievements of the humanitarian community against the objectives and targets of the 2018 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) and the evolving humanitarian situation in Yemen.</p><p>It builds on monitoring information collected every month and an end-of-year analysis of humanitarian needs and priorities. Complementary information is available at: <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/3000634">Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan</a></span> and <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/country/yem/thumb?primary_country=255&amp;source=1503&amp;search=%22yemen+humanitarian+dashboard%22+%222018%22#content">Response Monitoring Dashboard</a></span></p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2018</p><p>During 2018, working under increasingly difficult conditions, 254 international and national partners delivered food assistance, health care, nutrition support, protection, shelter, education, water and sanitation and livelihood support. Major achievements are summarized below:</p><p>Humanitarian partners managed one of the largest, fastest and most difficult scale-ups of food assistance. The number of people provided with food and livelihood assistance each month increased from 5.9 million to 7.5 million, a 27 per cent increase. As a result, the food and nutrition situation has improved in more than half of the 107 districts at-risk of famine, and as of today one-fifth are no longer at risk of famine.</p><p>Millions of destitute families benefited from direct support including agricultural, livestock and fisheries assistance to improve their livelihoods. FSAC partners reached a total of 2.26 million people and 160,000 people were provided with longer-term livelihoods support. Similarly, Emergency Employment and Community Rehabilitation (EECR) Cluster partners reached a total of 331,912 people, with emergency employment opportunities in 102 districts in 19 governorates. This represents a 14 per cent increase from 2017, when 290,000 people were reached by the cluster.</p><p>6.03 million people received nutrition support. This represents a 255 per cent increase from 2017, when 1.7 million people received nutrition support. The nutrition operation expanded considerably in 2018 and a higher percentage of ill and malnourished children are surviving in Yemen than at any time since the conflict started. The number of children treated for SAM increased by 31 per cent, up from 263,313 in 2017 to 345,661 in 2018. Similarly, the number of children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) admitted to Therapeutic Supplementary Feeding programmes (TSFP) supported by partners increased by 58 per cent from 360,163 in 2017 to 568,332 by the end of 2018. In addition, a total of 413,277 pregnant and lactating women (PLW) were admitted to TSFPs.</p><p>The largest cholera outbreak in modern history was contained.</p><p>Millions of people were reached with safe drinking water and sanitation support thanks to the considerable scale up of WASH service provision and rapid response teams (RRTs</p><p>Millions of ill and suffering Yemenis were being treated at health facilities throughout the country. Health Cluster partners worked through more than 2,200 health facilities, provided over 12 million consultations, delivered 16,616 mental health consultations, and treated 36,491 trauma cases. Skilled birth attendants assisted 255,172 deliveries and more than a million women received antenatal and postnatal care. More than 488,000 surgeries were performed. Vaccination campaigns for diphtheria, measles, rubella and polio reached 13.2 million people. Overall, the Cluster reached 12 million people in 2018, compared with 8.6 million people reached in 2017, representing an increase of 40 per cent.</p><p>1.4 million people received Shelter/NFI/CCCM Support.</p><p>More than 4 million people received protection services.</p><p>Although nearly 25 per cent of all students remain out of school, millions of children are able to learn because of the support provided by humanitarian partners. Education Cluster partners delivered education services to 1.8 million students. The Cluster reached 429,640 children with school meals. People reached increased by 80 per cent, from 1 million in 2017 to 1.8 million in 2018.</p><p>The response to displacement improved with the establishment of a Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) to assist people in the immediate aftermath of a crisis.</p><p>Overall, despite an increasingly difficult operating environment, the structure and the functioning of the humanitarian operation has improved.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/2018-yemen-humanitarian-response-plan-end-year-report-august-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/2018-yemen-humanitarian-response-plan-end-year-report-august-2019</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>Why Do the Yemeni Houthi Rebels Have North Korean Missiles?</strong></p><p>Key point: Many countries sell weapons and they can end up in different hands than those who bought them</p><p>It’s possible the <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/saudi-oil-attacks-latest-updates-190916102800973.html">missile strikes</a></span> that badly damaged a key Saudi oil facility on Sept. 14, 2019 involved far-flying drones firing small, guided munitions.</p><p>But it’s worth noting that the Houthis also possess a surprisingly sophisticated arsenal of homemade ballistic and cruise missiles possessing the range performance to strike targets deep inside Saudi Arabia.</p><p><span><a href="https://medium.com/war-is-boring/how-did-the-houthis-manage-to-lob-a-ballistic-missile-at-mecca-dfb568cb8242">According to</a></span> aviation expert Tom Cooper, the main weapon in the Houthi arsenal is the Burkan, a modified version of the Soviet R-17E Scud rocket that’s around five feet longer than the baseline missile and some 4,400 pounds heavier and can travel farther than 500 miles.</p><p>The Houthis inherited from the defunct Yemeni military a large number of Soviet-exported Scuds as well as North Korean-made Scuds called “Hwasong-6s.”</p><p>Iraq in the 1980s modified its own Scuds to the long-range “Al Hussein” standard, which is similar to the Burkan. An Iraqi engineer told Cooper about the modification effort, perhaps offering a perspective on the origins of the Houthis’ long-range rocket force.</p><p>“The R-17E is quite simple,” the engineer told Cooper.</p><p>“While this is hardly definitive proof that the Yemenis stretched R-17Es or Hwasong-6 on their own, it at least indicates that modifying older Scud-style missiles for longer range is possible.”</p><p>The Houthis also possess a cruise missile called the “Quds 1,” which <span><a href="https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1208062/meet-the-quds-1/?fbclid=IwAR0dMDG7MFQl9w1IWAar-oFJFeg54Bkp9CmbIhZ7IKo-TGnWqvLYWzlvT60">according to</a></span> missile expert Fabian Hinz could be a copy of the Iranian Soumar missile -- itself a copy of the Russian Kh-55.</p><p>Noting the overall similarity in design with the Soumar, many observers claimed Iran had simply smuggled it to Yemen where the Houthis gave it a new paintjob and a new name, as they had done before with the Qiam. …</p><p>[But] there are quite a few differences. Differences between the Quds 1 and the Soumar include the entire booster design, the wing position, the Quds 1’s fixed wings, the shape of the nose cone, the shape of the aft fuselage, the position of the stabilizers and the shape of the engine cover and exhaust. …</p><p>There is yet another apparent difference between the Quds 1 and the Soumar/Hoveyzeh: size.</p><p>Also, the Quds 1 features a Czech-made TJ100 engine, which is less powerful than the Russian-made engine on the Kh-55.</p><p>“All of this leaves the question of just who developed and built the Quds 1,” Hinz wrote. “The idea that impoverished war-torn Yemen would be able to develop a cruise missile without any outside assistance seems far-fetched. Iran’s previous supply of missiles to the Houthis and the fact that the country uses TJ100 engines in its drone program do imply that Iran could be behind the Quds 1.”</p><p>“However, so far we haven’t seen any trace of the Quds 1 in Iran proper. This riddle is not unique to the Quds 1. Beginning in 2018, several missile systems began to emerge in Yemen that while broadly similar to Iranian-designed systems have no exact Iranian equivalent.” – by David Axe</p><p><span><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-do-yemeni-houthi-rebels-have-north-korean-missiles-86821">https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-do-yemeni-houthi-rebels-have-north-korean-missiles-86821</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>A Yemeni Travel Odyssey: Unpredictable Airports and Risky Roads</strong></p><p>Under the best war-time circumstances, travel to, from and within Yemen is long, tiresome and stressful. There is constant uncertainty about whether airports will be open or closed or how smooth road travel will be through frontlines and scores of checkpoints run by various combatants. Since the Saudi-led coalition stopped commercial air traffic at Sana’a airport in 2016, many Yemenis have been unable to seek medical care abroad; the journey to alternative airports is difficult. My long-awaited trip began August 7, days after deadly twin attacks on police and militia targets in Aden and as southern separatists readied to turn on their government allies in the southern city.</p><p>Flights to Yemen operate from only five cities worldwide, with most Yemenis traveling via Amman or Cairo. Flying through Khartoum is more expensive, and flights from Jeddah and Riyadh are used mostly by Yemenis living in Saudi Arabia. </p><p>On arriving from Frankfurt, I have a 10-hour layover – more than the six-hour minimum required by Yemenia for its passengers transiting through Amman because its flights are regulated by the Saudi-led war coalition, meaning times can change or passenger lists can require verification if non-Yemenis are aboard. Some of my wait is spent explaining to security officers that I need to collect my luggage in the arrivals hall because Yemenia was unable to check my bags through to Aden. As a Yemeni, I need, but cannot be issued at the airport, a visa to enter the arrivals area.</p><p>Eventually, I am allowed access to collect my bags.</p><p>Luggage collected and back in departures, I meet a Yemeni woman in her 20s who came to Amman for back surgery. We speak about returning to Yemen – we both have missed our families in Sana’a while abroad and are looking forward to the comforting feeling of being home. We check in and are seated beside each other.</p><p>As our plane fills up, many sick or physically infirm passengers – often elderly with traveling companions – make their way to their seats.</p><p>We land in Aden three-and-a-half hours later in the dusty, humid late afternoon,</p><p>We wait nearly two hours for our luggage</p><p>I sleep early, with plans confirmed to leave early the next morning for the 460-kilometer journey to the capital, Sana’a. The driver collects from their homes three other women heading to Sana’a, and the four of us share the standard US$200 fee. There are cheaper options available; buses cost about US$23, but the journey takes up to four hours longer because of checkpoint delays while passengers are questioned and their papers checked. Some shared taxis pack in more passengers than ours, which can reduce the cost to as low as US$25 per person. </p><p>We pass 62 checkpoints along the way, some appearing well-established, others an individual soldier or two briefly stopping and waving through vehicles.</p><p>Our driver knows the unspoken rules and the roads, making the Aden-to-Sana’a journey daily and complaining of lack of sleep, especially with many Eid travelers and people fleeing the tense situation in Aden. The trickiest part of our journey, he says, will be in the southern Taiz governorate, passing through Al-Saylah “road,” which is packed dirt except when rainwater flows through from the surrounding mountains. This 10-kilometer stretch is wide enough for only one vehicle to pass, full of potholes and large rocks; it takes an hour to navigate, more when it rains. We find it muddy from the previous day’s rain, but passable. </p><p>Every day, though, I think about my return journey. I know the length of the trip and the type of roads we will travel.</p><p>On the morning of August 22, I set out on the 16-hour, 775-kilometer drive through the mountains to Marib and then across a vast stretch of desert to Sayoun</p><p>With Aden unstable and northerners being turned back at some checkpoints heading south to the city, many other travelers also had shifted their flights to Sayoun – by Aisha al-Warraq</p><p><span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/8186">https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/8186</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Why does Western MSM doggedly insists on branding Yemen’s Ansarullah “Iran-backed”?</strong></p><p>During the past five years, the western audience has been repeatedly told by the western mainstream media that those fighting Saudi Arabia in Yemen are Iran’s puppets fighting to take the helm in the country.</p><p>The latest wave of such reports came following the September 14 strikes into Aramco facilities in Saudi Arabia when a mountain of commentary emerged blaming Iran as the main culprit. </p><p>Both Tehran and Ansarullah have denied claims of Iranian weapons deliveries to Yemen, a country awash in weapons. </p><p>A senior Iranian general recently told China’s Phoenix TV Iran “provides advisory and intellectual assistance” to the popular forces in Yemen. This support is within the framework of the Iranian Constitution, which says the country is obliged to assist the oppressed around the globe. </p><p>Interestingly, the same media outlets that are screaming about Iran almost never point to the full-fledged western military support for Saudi Arabia in a comparable fashion. </p><p>They also prefer not to highlight the fact that Saudi Arabia itself is widely seen to be a British creation. </p><p>Moreover, we never see a similar branding in the MSM narrative on other conflicts, notably in Syria, where Saudi Arabia and the US have been exposed to be funding and training militants fighting to topple the Syrian government. </p><p>Good guys and bad guys</p><p>The western outlets, claimed to be freest and fairest in the world, have for a long time been favoring Saudi Arabia and its wealthy Arab neighbors in their reporting. </p><p>But this pro-Saudi narrative was apparently woven by the western governments and parroted by a wide array of MSM outlets in the mid-2010s. </p><p>In fact, Saudi Arabia and the US predicated the 2015 invasion of Yemen at least in part on the Iran-Ansarullah connection, arguing that the group is an Iranian proxy destroying democracy in Yemen. </p><p>But Ansarullah, of which the Houthis are only a part, are homegrown. T</p><p>Pigeonholing technique</p><p>The narrative of “state-controlled” insurgents is a common one for governments to use when facing a movement they cannot overcome. </p><p>In the propaganda war, the last thing any dictatorship wants is for the public to view the forces fighting them as common people. </p><p>So they come up with a story in which the rebellion is actually a villainous conspiracy plotted by a foreign power. </p><p>Once a rebellion against foreign-backed dictators is pigeon-holed as a proxy controlled by a foreign power, few among the public will listen to what they have to say no matter how factual it may be. </p><p>And this will prevent the movement from raising public awareness of the dictator’s crimes and encouraging others to join the movement. </p><p>Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are going to rewrite the narrative to fit their agenda, no matter if Ansarullah are legitimate or they have real grievances against Saudi Arabia. </p><p>Killing two birds </p><p>The branding will also help propagate an Iranophobic narrative that has been pushed by the western media since the 1979 revolution. </p><p>The western media has in recent years increasingly lamented Iran’s “regional influence” and its desire for world domination. </p><p>The key to this narrative is that the villainous regime in Iran is supporting proxy groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria to project its power on the whole region. </p><p>Iran is also locked in a cold war-like showdown with Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, according to this narrative. </p><p>In Yemen, the western media implies Iran is the wicked mastermind behind an insurgency led by the Houthi family, and Saudi Arabia is a savior bent on rescuing democracy in its southern neighbor.</p><p>This the narrative would allow the western politicians and media to kill two birds with one stone: Damaging legitimacy of Yemen’s desperate struggle for independence and survival, and tarnishing Iran’s image and bolstering the case for a war against the country. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/440988/Why-does-Western-MSM-doggedly-insists-on-branding-Yemen-s-Ansarullah">https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/440988/Why-does-Western-MSM-doggedly-insists-on-branding-Yemen-s-Ansarullah</a></span></p><p>My comment: This is from Iran – anyway, it simply describes things as they are.

Where are the reactions from the world community? </p><p>The world community has not cared about human suffering At the same time, we see that the attack on two oil plants in Saudi Arabia has provoked more upheaval and reactions from world leaders than the humanitarian suffering in Yemen after five years of warfare between Saudi Arabia and its allies.</p><p><span>Saudi Arabia has requested an international or UN-backed investigation into the oil strikes. But before such an investigation is carried out, several states - including the United States, the United Kingdom and France - have said that Iran is behind the attacks, as Saudi Arabia claims.</span></p><p>The war industry is the new oil </p><p>At the same time, these Western powers are leading the regional conflict and war in Yemen through the export of weapons and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia and its allies. These weapons have been proven used in the war. </p><p>Norway exported war supplies for a total of NOK 163 million to the Emirates in 2016 and 2017. In addition, the Oil Fund invests billions of Norwegian tax money in companies that make bombs used in Yemen. </p><p>The humanitarian disaster in Yemen has been neglected by the international community. It is the Yemeni civilian population who pay the price. The reactions following the attack on the oil plants, compared with the attention that has been devoted to human suffering in the war, attest to a reality where oil spills mean more than blood spills. It is time to focus more on the fatal consequences of the war to prevent more blood from being lost.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/nar-olje-er-viktigere-enn-blod/71680440/amp">https://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/nar-olje-er-viktigere-enn-blod/71680440/amp</a></span></p><p><span>(B K P)</span></p><p>The legal classification of the armed conflict in Yemen</p><p>The situation in Yemen has now turned into an international debate and the mechanisms to deal with the situation have remained unanswered.

The fuel shortage is causing increased food prices and a deepening health crisis, as deliveries of food and medical supplies take longer and hospitals need diesel to run their generators.</p><p>This will increase the suffering of children and their families in what is already the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The spike in transport fares will mean parents are unable to afford to take their children to hospitals.</p><p>Save the Children Director, Tamer Kirolos, said:</p><p>The fuel crisis is already impacting Save the Children’s humanitarian operations as we heavily rely on fuel availability to transport aid to the facilities we support. Between August and September, there was a 60%[1] decrease in the amount of fuel coming through Hodeidah port – this is because of a decree by the Government of Yemen requiring customs duties to be paid in Aden before allowing ships to discharge in Hodeidah, of course this means double customs duty. The price of fuel has increased by 100 per cent over the past 40 days, which made the transport of life saving goods to communities in need 30% more expensive. Transportation which previously took one day is now taking three days as trucks have to wait for fuel, resulting in huge delays in getting food and medicines to communities.</p><p>“We ask the international community to work with the Government of Yemen to waiver this decree immediately so that this unfolding crisis can be averted. It is vital that there is free, unhindered access for humanitarian and commercial goods, including fuel, into and across the country as this is a life-line for many families.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.savethechildren.net/news/fuel-shortages-deepen-crisis-yemen-%E2%80%93-save-children">https://www.savethechildren.net/news/fuel-shortages-deepen-crisis-yemen-%E2%80%93-save-children</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H P)</span></p><p>EXCLUSIVE: Yemen Runs Out of Fuel and Last Hospitals Close</p><p><span>While the mainstream media focuses on condemning President Trump for pulling US troops out of Syria, Yemen faces a national health crisis.

Cancer patients, kidney patients, pregnant women, children, and the elderly face the worst consequences.</p><p>Many people may not realize how a fuel shortage and blockade affects every aspect of Yemeni healthcare.</p><p>95% of the medical devices in Yemeni government hospitals are out of their validity period but doctors must work with them because there is no alternative.

They indicated that this vital role, starting in March 2015 with the “Storm of Determination”, eliminated Iranian extension and Al-Houthi control over territories in addition to eliminating terrorism and restoring legitimacy in the liberated governorates.<br /> Military Role in Deterring Coup and Terrorism:<br /> In the military context, UAE helped liberating vast areas of Yemen from Al-Houthi militias through supporting and equipping soldiers on the ground, sea and skies.<br /> Battel fronts under UAE supervision witnessed quick victories, starting with liberating Aden in May 2015 when UAE vanguard troops arrived at Aden and fought side by side with southern resistance to liberate Aden airport, then Lahj, Abian and finally the west coast and Al-Hodeida.<br /> UAE armed forces helped greatly in rearranging the southern resistance and arming it through forming new military brigades. This facilitated the liberation of southern governorates, Bab Al-Mandeb and Mareb Dam to Al-Makha and Al-Hodeida.<br /> Sons of Zayed sacrificed a lot during the fight with Al-Houthi militias as many of them martyred and their bloods wrote history of supporting Yemeni people in their crisis.<br /> Fighting Terrorism:<br /> The role of UAE was not limited to liberating governorates from Al-Houthi militias. The more difficult mission was to secure liberated governorates and clearing them off terrorist elements.

However, given Pompeo’s embrace of the regime-change mantra of the Iranian expat community—<span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/03/23/heres-john-bolton-promising-regime-change-iran-end-2018/">a sentiment he shared</a></span> with Trump’s then-national security adviser John Bolton—the “maximum pressure” campaign could only be interpreted as an act of economic warfare against Iran, as prelude to an eventual military campaign designed to remove the Shi’a theocracy that has ruled the country since assuming power in 1979. Bolton himself emphasized this <span><a href="https://lobelog.com/u-s-economic-warfare-and-irans-politics-of-muddling-through/">when he stated</a></span> in November 2018 that “[i]t is our intention to squeeze them very hard. As the British say: ‘Squeeze them until the pips squeak’.”</p><p>The State Department was particularly concerned about Iran’s so-called “malign activities” in Lebanon in support of Hezbollah, in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, and in Yemen in support of the Houthi rebels. The “maximum pressure” campaign was designed to starve these movements of Iranian financial support, thereby hastening the nation’s demise.</p><p>For a year following Trump’s May 8, 2018, exit from the JCPOA, <span><a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-04/news/iaea-says-iran-abiding-nuclear-deal">Iran complied with its obligations under that agreement</a></span>, adhering to every restriction while imploring the agreement’s other parties to honor their commitments and ignore the newly reimposed U.S. economic sanctions. This proved increasingly difficult as the U.S. treated any nation or company that used the U.S. banking system to facilitate a transaction with Iran in violation of its terms. As a result, in May 2019, Iran <span><a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/09/11/605896/Iran-Hassan-Rouhani-JCPOA">began suspending its commitments under the JCPOA</a></span>, something it (rightfully) claimed was <span><a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/09/08/605650/Zarif-Cornel-Feruta-Iran-IAEA-JCPOA">permitted under the terms of the JCPOA</a></span> in the case of noncompliance by a party to the agreement. (Iran claimed, with justification, that the EU was in noncompliance by failing to permit the unrestricted sale of Iranian oil to EU customers.) The U.S. responded by dispatching two B-52 bombers and an aircraft carrier battlegroup to the region, an action <span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-national-security-advisor-ambassador-john-bolton-2/">Bolton claimed</a></span> was intended to “send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.” By all appearances, it looked as if the U.S. campaign of “maximum pressure” was about to enter its final phase.</p><p>This is where the narrative gets interesting. Rather than retreat in the face of U.S. military pressure, Iran doubled down.</p><p>Saudi Arabia had always been a major factor in the “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran. One of the foundational requirements for a successful U.S. effort targeting Iranian oil sales was for oil markets to remain well supplied and oil inventory levels to remain consistently strong. </p><p>But rhetoric alone does not win the day. The problem for the United States has been that its campaign of “maximum pressure” has had zero impact on Iran’s so-called “malign activities” in the region.</p><p>If Trump’s goal in implementing the “maximum pressure” campaign was to eventually bring Iran to the negotiating table, then he may very well have succeeded. But history will show that it was Iran that set the conditions that brought the U.S. onboard, and not the other way around.</p><p>In May 2018, the myth of American military deterrence in defense of Saudi Arabia was still alive; today it lies shattered amidst the ruins of the destroyed Saudi oil facilities. Seen in this light, the collapse of the U.S. campaign of “maximum pressure” can only be interpreted as a strategic victory for Iran, and a decisive defeat for the United States – by Scott Ritter</p><p><span><a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/donald-trumps-iran-humiliation/">https://www.truthdig.com/articles/donald-trumps-iran-humiliation/</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Either all countries in Persian Gulf will benefit from security or suffer its absence: Zarif</p><p>Iran‘s Foreign Minister, Mohamad Javad Zarif, has highlighted the significance of maintaining security in the Persian Gulf, saying that either all countries in the region will benefit from security or all will be deprived of it.</p><p>In an article in the Kuwaiti al-Rai newspaper on Thursday, Zarif said that the security and stability of the Persian Gulf is an indispensable necessity in ensuring access to international markets.

In return, she received widespread demonization of her role, neutrality, and non-support for coalition military operations, sometimes accused of smuggling weapons to the Houthis, and sometimes subordination to Iran, which has distinct historical ties. </p><p>The Omani role was initially limited to coordination between the Houthi group and the Arab alliance.Muscat hosted several meetings between the two sides in the presence of a United Nations and American-European coordination, and was able to contribute to pushing the parties to the conflict towards several rounds of dialogue in Kuwait, Switzerland and Sweden.</p><p>With the outbreak of this [Qatar] crisis, the UAE and Saudi Arabia began to harass more Oman. This time through the presence of the two countries respectively in the Yemeni province of Al-Mahra adjacent to the Sultanate. The Sultanate sees Mahra as an extension of its geographical and historical depth, and therefore has maintained a distinct relationship with its inhabitants, while Saudi Arabia saw Mahra as a place to implement its historical agenda by extending its oil pipeline to the Arabian Sea, and an opportunity to turn the Mahra into an inflamed point to influence the Omani position and push it towards the destination it wants Saudi Arabia was quick to strengthen its presence in Al-Mahra, and at a rapid pace through which it tightened control over the province, which led to widespread public anger among the Mahrians, rejecting the Saudi presence.</p><p><span><a href="https://adengad.net/news/414554/">https://adengad.net/news/414554/</a></span></p><p>Remark by Elisabeth Kendall: <span>Long article analysing current </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hashtag_click">#Yemen</a></span><span> talks in Muscat.

And merely tightening US sanctions against Iran will most likely provoke, rather than deter, another Iranian attack.</p><p>The United States is exhausted from its Middle East wars, particularly because its overwhelming military advantage has not translated into enduring political influence. But America’s retreat has left a strategic vacuum, which the region’s most influential actors are vying to fill.</p><p>Over the last few years – and owing largely to US failures – Iran has strengthened its position by expanding its influence in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen via proxy non-state actors.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, by contrast, remains a <em>status quo</em> power, interested above all in stability – not least to facilitate oil sales.</p><p>In the meantime, Saudi Arabia has limited capacity for checking Iran’s ambitions. Not only does this put the Kingdom at risk of losing its dominant position in the region; it raises the likelihood of more assaults on vulnerable Saudi oil and petrochemical facilities, as well as public utilities.</p><p><span>An engaged US could help to stave off such developments, but it is far from clear that the Saudis can count on that.</span></p><p>Eventually, the US will have to decide how much force-projection capacity it is willing to maintain in the Gulf.

An additional crisis in the Gulf would likely harden the position of the warring parties in Yemen and continue to prolong the country’s humanitarian crisis.

To facilitate this effort, they have partnered with dubious allies in the West: right-wing groups that make a living out of Islamist fear <span><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/uae-backed-lobbying-outfit-bussola-institute-allowed-to-use-farmleigh-house-for-free-mhjw5j3nt">mongering</a></span>.</p><p>These groups rely on promoting bizarre and dangerous Islamophobic conspiracy theories</p><p>There has been a curious overlap, too, between the <span><a href="https://henryjacksonsociety.org/members-content/political-islam-in-the-uk/">lines</a></span> used by the foremost Islamophobic ideologues promoting these conspiracy theories and the <span><a href="https://lobelog.com/the-uae-campaign-against-political-islam-implications-for-london/">official messaging</a></span> of the UAE government as it insinuates itself into shaping the domestic security policy of European states.</p><p>The UAE’s disinformation network, headed by spin doctors at the Harbour Group and Camstoll in the U.S., has <span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/09/25/uae-qatar-camstoll-group/">worked</a></span> with bloggers and conspiracy theorists to feed these narratives into the Republican and conservative mainstream over the past eight years.</p><p>The UAE’s offensive to win Western hearts and minds against the many shades of grey in Islamism is an attempt to create a bogeyman that resonates with an audience merely waiting for a Muslim majority country like the Emirates to support their biases. The narrative is a façade, behind which the authoritarian counterrevolutionaries in the Arab world hide to legitimize repression, justify military interventions and make journalists and activists disappear. In the face of a potential Arab Spring 2.0 currently unfolding, the dichotomous narrative of ‘authoritarian stability’ versus ‘Islamist anarchy’ fails to account for growing grey area of liberal civil-society in the Arab world—one that is resilient enough not to view Islamism as a fundamental threat to building a more pluralist political future – by Andreas Krieger</p><p><span><a href="https://lobelog.com/laying-the-islamist-bogeyman-to-rest/">https://lobelog.com/laying-the-islamist-bogeyman-to-rest/</a></span></p><p>(* B)</p><p>More photos of beautiful Yemen</p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/AhmadAlgohbary/status/1181959258272862210">https://twitter.com/AhmadAlgohbary/status/1181959258272862210</a></span></p><p><span>(A)</span></p><p>At least 13 dead in Shabwah car accident</p><p>Eyewitnesses reported that a heavy transport truck collided with a passenger bus, killing 13 people who aboard the bus, all from Taiz province, while the truck driver was unharmed.</p><p>The eyewitnesses considered the accident a new murder crime committed by Hadi’s government for non-responding to citizens’ calls for the road maintenance.</p><p>This incident is one of dozens of similar incidents as a result of the Hadi government’s neglect of highways.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.uprising.today/at-least-13-dead-in-shabwah-car-accident/">https://www.uprising.today/at-least-13-dead-in-shabwah-car-accident/</a></span></p><p>My comment: Where in Yemen this would be better?</p><p>(B)</p><p>“In this short video, the creative twelve-year-old Hiba Al-Ma'ini invites us to keep the child inside of each of us.</p><p>In this short video, the creative twelve-year-old Hiba Al-Ma'ini invites us to keep the child in each of us.
