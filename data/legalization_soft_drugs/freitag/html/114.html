In the Western media narrative, the House of Saud and Gulf monarchs are intervening to [hold your nose] 'uphold the legitimate and democratically-elected leader of Yemen' against an unconstitutional coup that was directed, or at least facilitated, by the Iranian regime. In this context, Saudi bombing of civilians targets are 'mistakes'. In reality, however, the picture is somewhat different.</p><p>Yemen in Geopolitical Context</p><p>Yemen is essentially a country that has never escaped the shackles of colonialism, first under British rule, and now under proxy rule by Riyadh (on behalf of Washington). With a population similar in size to Saudi Arabia, but also the poorest country in MENA (Middle East and North Africa), the government in 'independent' Yemen has always been heavily influenced by Saudi money and its right-wing Wahhabi interpretation of Islam.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is feeling the hounds of hell on its trail as it watches Iran break free from Wall Street sanctions and re-enter the global energy trade. Iran has three times the population of Saudi Arabia, nearly as much oil and gas, and a budding security and trade alliance with Russia and China. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is as dependent on the US and UK as they are on it, so the only way 'forward' is by doing their bidding.</p><p>Where the interests of the House of Saud and the Houses of Wall Street, London and Paris merge is in the energy trade, and more specifically, the <strong>control of global shipping arteries</strong>. For all the hi-tech gadgetry used today, some very old technology still dominates our lives: ships and boats - <strong>90% of all world trade is carried over water.</strong> And so, as the British (and other sea-faring Europeans before them discovered); whoever rules the waves, rules the world.</p><p>Clearly on a fast-track to modernizing its infrastructure, it's only a matter of time before Iran takes its rightful place as the dominant player in the Middle East. Iran is thus exerting its influence over the world's busiest oil shipping route, which passes through the major choke point of the Strait of Hormuz. Iran knows that American warships won't be patroling those waters forever, and that without American 'protection', the House of Saud and the Gulf states will have no choice but to embrace Iran's entry into the markets, and on its own terms.</p><p>Riyadh is determined to prevent a new, independent regime from forming in Yemen because this would mean losing influence over the region's other crucial shipping choke point: the Mandeb Strait between Yemen and Djibouti, where the Red Sea meets the Gulf of Aden. This why it sees Iran's hand behind the Houthi rebellion: the Saudis are projecting their own Machiavellian schemes onto the Iranians. If <em>they </em>were in Iran's place, they would whip up a rebellion of their co-religionists. Indeed, this is precisely the strategy Saudi Arabia has followed to extend its influence across the Muslim world over the last half century.</p><p>[…]</p><p>Nations all along this route are expressing interest in partnership, and even Big Business in the West is excited by the potential bucks to be made. The problem is that the 'Masters of the Universe' in certain Western capitals would sooner set the world on fire than lose monopoly control of the seas (and thus world trade and banking). And thus, the utter chaos and anarchy we see spreading like cancer today, not least in both countries either side of the Gulf of Aden, Somalia and Yemen. These two countries ought to be thriving gatekeepers of the great Europe-China maritime route. Instead they're human wastelands, the by-product of Washington's insane quest for total world hegemony</p><p>Yemen Uprising</p><p>The 'coup-plotters' in Yemen are in fact Houthi tribesmen leading a popular revolution. Although predominantly Shia, and thus co-religionists with the majority Islamic sect in Iran, the Houthis have received ever-growing national, cross-community and inter-religious support since the movement's emergence in the 1990s. With an agenda that seeks democratic reform and social justice for all, the Houthis have been compared with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Their connections with Tehran end there, however: there is zero evidence of Iranian military support for their cause. Iran's involvement is limited to moral support for the revolution and efforts to <a title="http://217.218.67.231/Detail/2015/08/13/424520/ICRC-Peter-Maurer-Iran-humanitarian-aid-Yemen-IRCS-Ahmadi" href="http://217.218.67.231/Detail/2015/08/13/424520/ICRC-Peter-Maurer-Iran-humanitarian-aid-Yemen-IRCS-Ahmadi">deliver humanitarian aid to the besieged country</a>.</p><p>The House of Saud previously attacked the Houthis in 2009, at the behest of its long-time ally, Yemen's president Abdullah Saleh, who generally placated Riyadh since coming to power in 1994. Saleh and Saudi Arabia's joint attempt to suppress Yemenis' democratic demands by eradicating the Houthis was dubbed 'Operation Scorched Earth', a move that <a title="http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/saudi-arabia-s-long-history-destructive-intervention-yemen-1549856872" href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/saudi-arabia-s-long-history-destructive-intervention-yemen-1549856872">even US diplomats described at the time as</a> "<em>dangerous and delusional</em>."</p><p>Never shy of behaving in a ruthless and delusional manner, the US nevertheless, under newly-elected president Barack Obama, participated in 'Scorched Earth' by carrying out 80 targeted operations - from drones, bombers and warships - in northern Yemen, and <a title="https://www.hrw.org/report/2013/10/22/between-drone-and-al-qaeda/civilian-cost-us-targeted-killings-yemen" href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2013/10/22/between-drone-and-al-qaeda/civilian-cost-us-targeted-killings-yemen">killing at least 473 people</a>, according to Human Rights Watch. The justification for doing so was that a new terror organization named 'Al-Qaeda-in-the-Arabian-Peninsula' had suddenly sprung up in Yemen, from where it was somehow <a title="http://www.sott.net/article/200106-The-Underwear-Bomber-Crushing-Freedom-With-Phony-Arab-Terrorism" href="http://www.sott.net/article/200106-The-Underwear-Bomber-Crushing-Freedom-With-Phony-Arab-Terrorism">inducing the teenage sons of rich Nigerians to pack explosives into their underwear</a> and board airplanes bound for the Land of the Free. Yes indeed, <strong>the 'underwear bomber' farce was actually about suppressing democracy in Yemen.</strong></p><p>Westerners rarely heard about Houthi rebels that time around, but the 2011 uprising in Yemen (one of the 'Arab Spring' revolutions that was <em>not</em> supposed to happen) changed all that. To satisfy protesters' demands, the Saudis replaced Saleh with his long-time number 2, Abd Rabbuh Mansur al-Hadi, a weak leader whose efforts to form a unity government could not placate the nationwide groundswell for real change. With constitutional reforms still not forthcoming, the Houthis took power in the capital Sana'a in January 2015. Al-Hadi and his government resigned and fled to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>For an all-too-brief moment, it looked like the people of Yemen had finally shaken off the curse of colonialism to begin charting their own course. But the House of Saud had other plans. Having run to Riyadh, the former President Al-Hadi then rescinded his resignation and declared his overthrow an 'unconstitutional coup'. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 2201, which petitioned the Houthis to immediately withdraw from government institutions, and for all parties to agree on a time frame for 1.) drafting constitutional reform, 2.) holding a referendum to ratify the new constitution, and 3.) conducting elections under the new electoral law.</p><p>One wonders what was going through the Russian delegation's mind as it abstained during this UN vote, considering the US position <em>vis a vis</em> the 'legitimacy' of presidents Assad and Yanukovich. When justifying the violent coup d'état in Ukraine in 2014, US spokeswoman Jen Psaki claimed that Yanukovich had lost all legitimacy because he "<em>abdicated his responsibilities by fleeing Kiev during a political crisis</em>." He didn't; he was running for his life, unlike al-Hadi, who was under house arrest but not under threat of facing a Houthi firing squad.</p><p>'Shock and Awe', Obama-style</p><p>In any event, the next thing we know, the Saudi ambassador to the US is announcing - at a press conference in Washington, DC - that his country's air force has commenced airstrikes in 'Operation Decisive Storm' against Houthi targets. Nine countries had been enlisted to provide military support and troops to Saudi Arabia - Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain. Somali airspace was also 'made available' to the coalition, a remarkable feat of international diplomacy given that Somalia is a failed state with no central government.</p><p>The Saudi ambassador's press conference had barely ended before the US government issued a statement saying it would be providing "<em>logistical and intelligence support</em>" to the Saudi campaign, as well as establishing a "<em>joint planning cell</em>" with Saudi Arabia to co-ordinate the airstrikes. The British government recently acknowledged that its <a title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/12102089/UK-military-working-alongside-Saudi-bomb-targeters-in-Yemen-war.html" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/12102089/UK-military-working-alongside-Saudi-bomb-targeters-in-Yemen-war.html">'specialists' are present inside Saudi command centers</a>, where their invaluable 'expertise' - gleaned from decimating Iraq, Libya and Syria - assists the Wahhabist regime's military in selecting targets. The whole thing had obviously been pre-arranged by the US government, and behind closed doors, with no UN mandate or basis in international law required.</p><p><strong>What is actually happening in Yemen is pretty much the scenario the US claims is playing out in Syria; a popular uprising being brutally suppressed</strong>. Except, in this case, the US, through its royalist puppets in the region, is playing the role of 'brutal dictator deliberately killing civilians'. Again we see that the truth does not just radically differ from the Western narrative; it's completely inverted. <strong>While posturing over the 'democratic legitimacy' of Al-Hadi, Saudi Arabia, a country that wouldn't recognize democracy if it smashed into it in the form of a fiery comet, has used every dirty trick in the book to topple the Syrian government</strong></p><p>And so Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, using recently-purchased British and American weapons, and <a title="https://www.rt.com/uk/329173-british-military-advisors-yemen/" href="https://www.rt.com/uk/329173-british-military-advisors-yemen/">guided by British and American 'advisers'</a>, suddenly and violently intervened in Yemen. Not only that, <strong>their military is staffed by officers from the UK and elsewhere. Qatar, for example, </strong><a title="https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairfo/20120803.aspx" href="https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairfo/20120803.aspx"><strong>only recently began training its own pilots</strong></a><strong>; it's air force is almost entirely a NATO outfit - French bombers, American bombs, British pilots and technicians.</strong></p><p>Just as European countries were pushed out in front for the obliteration of Libya in 2011, Operation Decisive Storm is the US '<a title="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/27/obama-libya-leadership-nato" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/27/obama-libya-leadership-nato">leading from behind</a>', part of the Obama-era 'liberal' re-formulation of the empire's aggressive post-9/11 foreign policy. It's the same 'shock and awe' conducted by the Bush regime, except that it's delivered covertly via the military structures of its vassals, enabling the US government to pull the strings behind Saudi Arabia's blatant violation of Yemen's sovereignty.</p><p>Saudi-Western War Crimes</p><p>So what targets are the British and Americans telling the Saudis to strike? Well, the airstrikes are clearly not just aimed at the rebels, but at large sections of the Yemeni population. We can only conclude from this that their purpose is to destabilize the whole nation. <strong>Schools, </strong><strong><a title="http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/11/11/icrc-decries-deliberate-attacks-hospitals-yemen" href="http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/11/11/icrc-decries-deliberate-attacks-hospitals-yemen">hospitals</a></strong><strong>, mosques, homes, refugee camps, daycare centres, markets, factories, power plants, food storage warehouses, and entire neighborhoods have been pulverized.</strong> The airport in Sana'a, the port in Hudaydah, roads, <a title="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/01/iran-accuses-saudi-jets-attacking-yemen-embassy-160107110649651.html" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/01/iran-accuses-saudi-jets-attacking-yemen-embassy-160107110649651.html">embassies</a> and <a title="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-10-12/saudi-arabia-bombs-second-yemeni-wedding-week-least-23-dead" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-10-12/saudi-arabia-bombs-second-yemeni-wedding-week-least-23-dead">weddings</a> have also been targeted.

[…]</p><p>What can we conclude form this but that Saudis are [even] proposing and exploiting ceasefires in order to gain 'military advantage', namely to <strong>terrorize the civilian population into relinquishing their support for the rebels</strong>.</p><p>A UN panel investigating the terror-bombing in Yemen <a title="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-01-28/saudi-arabia-conducted-119-airstrikes-against-civilian-targets-yemen-un-panel-finds" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-01-28/saudi-arabia-conducted-119-airstrikes-against-civilian-targets-yemen-un-panel-finds">announced last week</a> that the Saudi-led coalition is conducting "<em>widespread and systematic</em>" attacks on civilians and civilian-related targets. Coming under pressure to cease sending billions' worth of weapons to the Saudis, the British government responded in the only way it knows how: by having its Minister for the Middle East, Tobias Ellwood, tell the UK parliament that the UN panel's report was <a title="https://www.rt.com/uk/330589-saudi-war-crimes-yemen/" href="https://www.rt.com/uk/330589-saudi-war-crimes-yemen/">based on 'lies' spread by the Houthis</a>.</p><p>Obviously well-trained by the Masters of Terror, Saudi coalition jets have also been conducting <a title="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/footage-shows-civilian-rescuers-killed-saudi-double-tap-strike-yemen-1685540929" href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/footage-shows-civilian-rescuers-killed-saudi-double-tap-strike-yemen-1685540929">double-tap airstrikes</a> (where an initial, smaller bombing tempts rescuers, family members and neighbours to approach the site and search through wreckage for survivors, only for everyone in the vicinity to be wiped out by a second, larger bomb). <strong>While </strong><a title="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/despite_atrocities_us_approves_129_billion_deal_20151117" href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/despite_atrocities_us_approves_129_billion_deal_20151117"><strong>US-made bombs</strong></a><strong> rain down from </strong><a title="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-has-sold-56bn-of-military-hardware-to-saudi-arabia-under-david-cameron-research-reveals-a6797861.html" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-has-sold-56bn-of-military-hardware-to-saudi-arabia-under-david-cameron-research-reveals-a6797861.html"><strong>UK-made jets</strong></a><strong>, foreign ISIS/al-Qaeda operatives (which are basically operating as Saudi and Qatari ground forces) ensure there is no refuge for civilians</strong> by <a title="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/02/middleeast/yemen-violence/" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/02/middleeast/yemen-violence/">blowing up the mosques where they take shelter</a>, and committing <a title="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/isis-claims-dutch-fighter-carried-out-yemen-suicide-bombing-behalf-terror-group-1540655" href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/isis-claims-dutch-fighter-carried-out-yemen-suicide-bombing-behalf-terror-group-1540655">targeted assassinations of local leaders who support the Houthi revolution</a>.</p><p>A combination of cowardice, inexperience, and '<a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluenza" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluenza">affluenza</a>' means the Saudis have little stomach for engaging in any of the dirty work of direct military engagement with the determined rebels.

In the absence of Russian-Iranian intervention or some other miracle, respite for the people of Yemen may come in the fact that the 70% oil price collapse has hammered the Kingdom's budget, which could soon see it default on its debts. <a title="https://www.rt.com/business/330857-saudia-arabia-oil-austerity/" href="https://www.rt.com/business/330857-saudia-arabia-oil-austerity/">The IMF is warning</a> that - at the rate it is currently hemorrhaging money - Saudi Arabia will be coming to it, cap-in-hand, for loans by 2020.</p><p>Manufacturing Refugees</p><p>Westerners have been oblivious to Yemenis' screams in part because they're focused on what is immediately visible: 'the refugee crisis' - specifically the 'Syrian refugee crisis'. That particular refugee stream has been politicized to advance the Western agenda of forcing regime change in Syria - and possibly that country's dismemberment. And yes, the case can be made that European leaders were essentially given orders last year to 'stand down' and suddenly let in - against standard practice - unusually large numbers of people fleeing from Daesh in Syria.</p><p>But the purpose of this was not to enable 'Muslim hordes' to take over and institute 'Sharia law in Europe' or to 'destroy Western civilization'. <strong>The purpose was to advance the longer-term post-9/11 agenda of fomenting a 'clash of civilizations' that justifies the imposition of police state measures everywhere.</strong> Whether you self-identify as a Muslim, Christian, European, libertarian, socialist, traditionalist, atheist, or whatever, as far as the global elite are concerned, we're <em>all </em>'hordes' that 'destroy civilization' and must therefore be terrorized, hystericized, and anaesthetized into ever finer orders of control.</p><p>In the meantime, Europe is left to pick up the pieces from wars that are primarily Washington's doing - the results of which are increasing chaos in the cities refugees are migrating to, and a toxic atmosphere that is thick with hysteria and outrage, some of it justified, but much of it rich with the scent of fascism.</p><p>In the midst of this 'rude awakening', however, <strong>it seems to have become lost on Westerners that those refugees 'coming over here to tarnish our White European Values' are the result of precisely such Western corporate joint ventures as the ongoing obliteration of Yemen</strong>. There is a real danger of all that anger generated against the political class over the last decade - after they bailed out the banksters and made the people pay for it - being 'transmuted' into rage at the refugees.</p><p>The UNHCR estimates the attack on Yemen has generated 140,000 refugees within Yemen thus far - a number it expects will reach 250,000 by the end of 2016. Then we must factor in the <a title="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e486ba6.html" href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e486ba6.html">246,000 registered refugees in Yemen</a> <em>prior to the Saudi-led intervention</em>, 95 per cent of whom are Somalis which Yemenis sheltered after <a title="http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_64264.shtml" href="http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_64264.shtml">Western proxy intervention in Somalia</a> in the early 2000s. That's another half a million people.

Social media and what limited reporting exists convey anecdotal stories of anger toward all sides. But do any groups enjoy popular support beyond their immediate numbers? Houthis seem to have little support in the south, but how strong is their support in the north? Hadi is described as having little support inside of Yemen, but how low is “little”? What political parties or groups retain any real basis of support? Even more than asking “how much” support, what does support or loyalty mean? That is, under what conditions might we expect it to erode or sustain?</p><p>What about Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL)? How was AQAP able to take over much of the Hadramawt valley and the Mukullah port?</p><p>Who are the Zaydis politically? History clearly tells us that conflicts in Yemen have included as much Zaydi-Zaydi fighting as they have Zaydis fighting Muslim of other sects. Few in Yemen viewed these contests as primarily sectarian because the disputes were based in other power struggles.</p><p>The war in Yemen did not begin as a Sunni-Shia sectarian contest. The Gulf states may see it as such, but recall that the transition period broke down because Hadi had begun to <a href="http://www.merip.org/yemens-imposed-federal-boundaries">stack powerful committees exclusively with allies</a>, not because of sectarian strife. By insisting that Yemen’s domestic conflicts are sectarian-based, the Gulf states are acting as identity entrepreneurs. AQAP and ISIS, while hardly Gulf allies, also advance narratives of Sunni-Shia hatred. With Iran now the only friend the Houthis have, it is unsurprising to see their relationship deepening. Most tragic is the impact of this new sectarianism on the Yemeni people. As the ongoing violence is framed as Sunni versus Shia, those identities seem to be becoming more solidified.</p><p>Sectarianism is becoming real, but it may not be too entrenched to take a different path. We simply do not know where the broader Zaydi community and other centers of power stand in the conflict and whether they are latching hold to sectarian understandings of the war.</p><p>If Yemeni tribal groups possess some 60 million arms outside of government control, who controls them now? Some tribes have clearly chosen sides, but we do not know where others stand. Even for those actively fighting, we do not know whether those alliances will endure over time.</p><p>Yemen’s many armed tribes have always functioned as competing centers of power to the central government and they have been proud of their autonomy.</p><p>During the uprisings, tribes adopted a wide range of positions. We simply do not know where every tribe stands in the war, nor do we have reason to believe that wartime alliances will remain stable when the fighting subsides.</p><p>Even more, it is not clear what “tribe” means anymore. Some tribal elites have fled to urban areas like Sana’a, creating the phenomena of <a href="http://www.cemmis.edu.gr/files/middle_east_bulletin_23/#/6">city sheikhs</a>. Having left their constituencies behind, these tribal leaders may be losing the loyalty of their support base, particularly the younger members. Unable to provide employment and security, or to resolve local conflicts, they appear to be losing the moral authority that undergirded their power. While tribes in Yemen never functioned in a singular or unitary manner, the strength of tribal affiliations is no longer even clear. But the arms remain and tribal groups will certain endure as powerful actors in postwar Yemen – by Jillian Schwedler</p><p><strong>28.1.2016 – Atlantic Council (*** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen’s Image Problem and the Ongoing Conflict</strong></p><p>Hadi enjoys little popular support inside Yemen and Bahah’s recent <a href="http://www.gulfmagazine.com/english/6095/">praise of Saudi Arabia’s role</a> in Yemen has led many to conclude that he may not be as different from Hadi as <a href="http://www.yemenpeaceproject.org/blogpost/analysis-commentary/hadi-v-bahah/">many had hoped</a>. Few see the government’s return as a turning point in the war, particularly as the bombings continue.</p><p>The situation in Yemen <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/news/208122/yemen-airstrikes-disgusted-hopeless/">understandably feels hopeless</a> to many Yemenis, who have suffered through nearly a year of war.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2016/01/22/iran-and-saudi-arabia-double-down-cold-war-neither-can-win-413623.html">talk in Washington and the media</a> has largely framed the war as a proxy struggle between Iran (supporting the Houthis) and Saudi Arabia (supporting Hadi), a battleground for the new Cold War in the Middle East and the latest frontline in Muslim sectarianism. But this view obscures the <a href="http://merip.org/yemens-imposed-federal-boundaries">legitimate concerns</a> of many Yemenis over their exclusion from a transition process that was promised to be inclusive. Talk of Iranian-Saudi rivalry also treats the plight of the Yemeni people as a secondary issue: Yemen is seen as important only because of its <a href="http://www.merip.org/moral-economy-distance-yemeni-crisis">role in larger problems</a>—be that the Iranian-Saudi rivalry or the spread of Islamist extremism. The Yemeni people figure only peripherally in such perspectives.</p><p>How can the international community reconcile the concern for millions in Syria and Iraq while paying minimal attention to the lives of 26 million Yemenis? Part of the problem relates to <a href="http://www.cjr.org/analysis/why_almost_no_ones_covering_the_war_in_yemen.php">relatively little coverage</a> of the war in Yemen. Journalists face enormous difficulty in traveling to the country and few have any extended experience there. Still, many online voices from Yemen offer a full spectrum of political perspectives.</p><p>A larger reason behind such disregard stems from Yemen’s image problem. In much of the Arab world, Yemenis are treated as embarrassing, dumb relatives. Their clothing, tribal daggers, high illiteracy, and extreme poverty contribute to an Orientalist image of a land and people untouched by time. Tribal groups and jihadists frequently <a href="http://www.al-bab.com/yemen/data/kidnap.htm">kidnap foreigners</a> to use as bargaining chips, releasing them after obtaining funds or services from a central government that often denies that such negotiations took place. The spectacular architecture and ancient sites, combined with more than 60 million weapons in civilian control, suggest to outsiders that Yemen is the Wild West of the Arabian Peninsula: exciting and exotic, but also dangerous and lawless.</p><p>While Yemen is celebrated as a <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ye">world cultural heritage site</a>, Yemenis are not celebrated for having both built and maintained them under near-impossible circumstances. Instead, they treated as backward or retarded (in Arabic, <em>mutakhallafin</em>).</p><p>The separation of celebrated Yemeni heritage sites from the actual Yemeni people has a corollary in the policy view of Yemen as a rogue or failed state.</p><p>These two perceptions—that the Yemeni people are backward and that the Yemeni state is weak—create the justifications for assuming that Yemen cannot resolve its problems on its own. At the very least, according to this formulation, its people and thus its problems must be contained.</p><p>Real political solutions are possible, but they demand a lens that rejects the image of a Yemeni Wild West for one in which Yemenis are given a central role in shaping their future. This can only happen when all parties accept that the conflict stems from legitimate concerns expressed by numerous political groups in Yemen. The return of Bahah and his cabinet to Aden will not mark a turning point for the country until the broader political field is directly and adequately represented, as they were in the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/yemen-parties-agree-transitional-council-says-united-nations-envoy-1424424249">Transitional Council</a>. Unfortunately, Saudi Arabia seems little interested in a solution that does not result in a Hadi-led government. The Houthis and deposed president Ali Abdullah Salih, for their part, have little to gain by ending the conflict. Under these conditions, the unfortunate images of Yemen as a failed state and of Yemenis as unable to govern themselves will likely continue – by Jillian Schwedler</p><p><a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/yemen-s-image-problem-and-the-ongoing-conflict">http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/yemen-s-image-problem-and-the-ongoing-conflict</a></p><p>Comment: Wow this is a brilliant article. In many Arab countries Yemen has been described to me as 'uncultured' and 'backward' which was exactly the opposite of my view after living in Yemen - but it was different, with to me a refreshing philosophy on life that I enjoyed and benefited from. And in the Western world it was hardly mentioned and if it was, it was associated with 'terror' and Al Qaeda - neither of which featured highly in my life in Yemen where I always felt safe and valued. What is culture if it isn't living your own way rather than in the ways of the powerful West, keeping to your own valued traditions and practices? Those values included acceptance of 'the Other', mutual respect, pride in their country, hospitality and generosity. Yes Yemen was poor - desperately poor - and yes education was not given priority. But that didn't make it uncultured - or weak.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/yemennewstodayenglish/posts/1096321070520383">https://www.facebook.com/yemennewstodayenglish/posts/1096321070520383</a></p><p><strong>3.2.2016 – Middle East Monitor (*** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>The real cost of Middle East wars</strong></p><p>Each new weapon competes to cause greater killing and devastation. Success in the arms race is measured in the amount of innocent blood spilled. The reward for the winners is international praise and money to commit new slaughter. New weapons introduced by one side leads the other bloc to develop an even better one. While money is spent on developing a weapon, billions of dollars are also diverted to develop defence systems to counter it. The world’s resources are more than adequate to feed, house and provide pleasant lives for its 7 billion inhabitants, yet these countries spend their wealth, not on keeping people alive, but on the means to kill them.</p><p>The money spent on arms represents only a very small part of the total cost of wars. Several think-tanks have calculated the cost to the US economy of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan at $6 trillion. A large part of the cost represents expenditure not on the battlefield but on indirect costs. In addition to the $2 trillion it has already spent, the US will spend another $4 trillion over the next 30 years in loan interest, new arms purchases and lifetime health costs for injured veterans. One week before the start of the Iraq War, the then US Vice President Dick Cheney said that it would last only 2 years and would cost around $100 billion. However, the conflicts have never ended, and the cost has been at least 40-50 times higher.</p><p>The world is becoming an ever more dangerous place, with the side-effects of wars that cannot be measured in money. Billions of dollars are being spent on security alone. Instead of our old world fighting hunger, poverty and disease, huge efforts are being made to protect against threats from unknown directions.</p><p>In its peace report for 2014, the Institute for Economics and Peace revealed that 81 countries have gradually become more dangerous places, including Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Israel and Lebanon. The annual cost of the climate of violence in these six countries alone is $300 billion. The annual cost to the world due to violence is estimated at $10 trillion. Of that, $3 trillion represents the costs of obtaining arms, $3 trillion is related to crime and personal violence (murders, acts of violence in society, sex crimes and prison expenditure), $2.2 trillion for domestic security and $1.2 trillion for the cost of regional or global conflicts. Instead of this money being spent on preventing hunger, poverty and the deaths of homeless children, and raising prosperity across the world, it is being wasted on a dead-end from which there can be no winners.</p><p>It would be wrong to measure the costs of war in monetary terms alone, though. The climate of conflict that peaked with the “War on Terror” programme has cost some 3 million lives. It is impossible to put a financial valuation on the right to life of innocent men, women, children and the elderly. This process has, to date, devastated eight countries. Hundreds of cities and tens of thousands of towns have to be rebuilt. Four million people have had to flee their countries, while another 8 million are displaced within them. Turkey alone is housing more than 2 million Syrian refugees. Hundreds of thousands are clamouring at the border of the EU, many of whom drown before they ever get there.</p><p>Another major effect of the wars in the Middle East that will persist for many long years is the way that they have distanced the peoples of the East and West from one another. Islam is equated with war and terror in many Western homes, while in the East, millions regard the people of the West as invaders and warmongers.</p><p>The greatest cost of these wars is the way that all sides lose their humanity. Official news agencies carry reports of how many bombs have been produced and how many targets have been struck every day, and portray their own countries as heroic. Yet it is unclear who is targeted or hit in these operations. Military spokespersons describe “successful” operations as things to be proud of, even though all such terminology in fact means more corpses, more destruction and more poverty. The material and psychological costs of this sort of scenario will grow even more terrible so long as mankind tries to solve disputes through war, instead of peace. The goal should be to act outside of this mindset and bring peace to the world. More war will never be the way to do this – by Harun Yayha</p><p><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/articles/middle-east/23703-the-real-cost-of-middle-east-wars">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/articles/middle-east/23703-the-real-cost-of-middle-east-wars</a></p><h2> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Allgemein / General</strong></span></h2><p>5.2.2016 – Critical Threats (A K T)</p><p>2016 Yemen Crisis Situation Report: February 5</p><p>A U.S. airstrike killed a senior al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) military official, which will probably disrupt operations in the coming weeks, but is unlikely to roll back AQAP's gains in southern Yemen.</p><p>A U.S. airstrike killed veteran AQAP military commander Jalal al Bal’idi al Marqishi, according to reports.</p><p>AQAP is consolidating control along a primary road that runs from Abyan through Shabwah and into Hadramawt.

With the full complicity of the US and NATO, the Saudi led coalition has been bombarding the blockaded nation for 10 months with no respite for Yemen's civilians. Targets have been predominantly densely populated civilian areas, essential infrastructure, hospitals, schools, wedding venues, mosques and homes across Yemen. Over 7,500 have been massacred since March 2015. Yemeni people are battered, bloodied and starving and the world is silent. The use of cluster bombs in densely populated civilian areas has ensured a devastation on a terrifying scale. Smart bombs supplied by the UK, mercenaries imported by Saudi Arabia via companies such as Blackwater have increased the pressure on this civilian population. <br /> The UN has done nothing, even allowing the withdrawal of the investigation into Saudi crimes against Humanity in Yemen, appointing Saudi delegates to head up the UN Human Rights Panel. While the blood of the Yemeni people runs in rivers in their own land, punished for standing in defiance against Saudi oppression, corruption and brutality, the world looks the other way. This must end. The world must act. The UN must fulfill its purpose. On the 28th February 2016 a team of Yemeni delegates and supporters will go to Geneva to present a case for the illegal use of Cluster Bombs and the deteriorating Humanitarian situation in Yemen.

The Saudi-led coalition is spending an estimated <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-21/in-one-saudi-town-gunfire-all-day-brings-yemen-war-near-home">$200 million</a> a day on Operation Restore Hope (with the Saudis probably paying the bulk of it). At $6 billion a month, this expenditure equals about 1% of the country’s estimated foreign reserves.</p><p>Two relevant news reports came out of the recent meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-iran-oic-idUKKCN0UZ1YZ">first</a> report—citing “OIC Secretary General Iyad Madani, a Saudi”—described a call “for a de-escalation of tensions between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran.” This reports suggests that a faction within Saudi Arabia was trying to save face by using the OIC as an impartial Islamic arbiter, suspending combat in Yemen at the OIC‘s “request.” The <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-iran-oic-idUKKCN0V00LV">second</a>, entitled “World Islamic body backs Saudi stance in Iran spat,” indicated that a more hard-line Saudi view had prevailed. At the same time, however, the Gulf Cooperation Council Secretary General<a href="http://almasdaronline.com/article/79168"> stated</a> that the GCC is looking to restart the political process in Yemen and also floated the idea of an international donors’ conference to discuss reconstructing the country, both of which suggest that the GCC is preparing for a post-kinetic phase, both operationally and for public relations purposes.</p><p>There have been signs of military preparation for a compromise and coalition withdrawal, too. Although <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/sanaa-battle-looms.html">bombastic</a> announcements of <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/yemen/yemen-army-mobilising-forces-for-dhamar-operation-1.1661232">imminent assaults</a> have continued, other reports suggest something different.</p><p>Politically, members of the Saudi-backed Yemeni side have been making statements that hint at a more realistic, Yemeni compromise coming to the fore, clearly with an eye to the future.</p><p>As with the Multi-National Corps in Iraq, the Saudi-led coalition needs to recast its original aims so as to declare them achieved and then withdraw swiftly before the security bubble around Aden collapses. (Establishing this latter may be the aim of the recent troop reinforcement in Aden.) Hadi is probably a liability. His support within the Yemeni polity, never strong, is now negligible. And restoring him to Sana’a by force is an unlikely scenario. It would not be surprising if Hadi were to die tragically—possibly in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/world/middleeast/yemen-bombing.html">Suicide Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device attack</a>—since this would force a revisiting of the provisions of the maximalist <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2216(2015)">UN Security Council Resolution 2216</a> and the establishment of a more realistic desired end state.</p><p>Bahah is clearly positioning himself as a candidate for president. Yet Salih has a long history of casting himself as the alternative to chaos. Although his return to the presidency would be unacceptable to virtually everyone inside and outside the country, he may be trying to install his eldest son Ahmad in the presidency, something the Emiratis at least may countenance.</p><p>A genuine compromise that represents all legitimate interests would make it more likely that Yemenis would reconcile—as they did after the last foreign Arab intervention in the 1960s—and work together to rebuild their nation and defend it against Salafi terrorists. Without such a genuine compromise, Yemen is likely to collapse into more civil war. If this proves to be the case, then the current two-sided conflict is likely to descend into a vicious multi-faction conflict. Existing tensions within both blocs would then break out into the open, fueled by advanced weapons imported by the Saudi-led coalition. To prevent such an outcome, the international community must be ready to step in to guarantee the peace and rehabilitate the country as soon as possible – <strong>by James Spencer</strong></p><p><a href="https://lobelog.com/have-the-saudis-given-up-hope-of-restoring-hadi-as-yemens-president/">https://lobelog.com/have-the-saudis-given-up-hope-of-restoring-hadi-as-yemens-president/</a></p><p>Comment: I hope so!!!

Zu klein das Land und zu groß die Anzahl der Konflikte, die in der Region schwelen. Dabei ist der humanitäre Bedarf des ohnehin ärmsten Landes des Nahen Ostens größer als der jeder anderen Krise der Welt, größer als der in Syrien und dem Südsudan zusammen. Mehr als 80 Prozent der Bevölkerung sind laut dem Flüchtlingshilfswerk der Vereinten Nationen auf Hilfslieferungen angewiesen, darunter auch über 2,5 Millionen Menschen, die innerhalb ihres Landes vertrieben sind. Die Zivilbevölkerung leidet stark unter der andauernden Krise und der mit ihr verbundenen Gewalt, rund 6.000 Menschen haben seit Ausbruch des Konflikts im März 2015 ihr Leben verloren.</p><p>Das Ausmaß der humanitären Katastophe ist gewaltig. Über 14 Millionen Menschen sind von Nahrungsunsicherheit bedroht, eine Folge von steigenden Lebensmittelpreisen und Versorgungsengpässen. Einer Umfrage von OCHA (Organisation for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) zufolge steht jeder zweite Mensch im Jemen täglich vor der Frage, wie er seinen Hunger stillen kann. Zerstörerische Bombenangriffe und Probleme bei der Energieversorgung führen außerdem dazu, dass immer weniger Menschen Zugang zu Gesundheitsdiensten und Schulbildung haben.</p><p>CARE fordert die internationale Gemeinschaft auf, Druck auf sämtliche Konfliktparteien auszuüben, damit eine politische Lösung des Konflikts gefunden werden kann. Nur so kann in dem krisengebeutelten Land wieder Frieden und Sicherheit einkehren und eine weitere humanitäre Katastrophe im Ausmaß der Syrienkrise verhindert werden. Auch im Hinblick auf die aktuelle Flüchtlingskrise muss eine weitere Destabiliserung der Region verhindert werden. „Der Jemen muss politisch wieder stabil werden. Gleichzeitig muss die Finanzierung von humanitärer Hilfe und Entwicklungsprojekten fortgesetzt werden. Wenn sich die politische Stabilität des Landes weiter verschlechtert und es keine weitere Unterstützung gibt, wird es immer schwieriger werden, die Menschen im Jemen mit dringend benötigter Hilfe zu erreichen“, so Daw Mohammed, CARE-Länderdirektor im Jemen. Bis dahin muss sichergestellt werden, dass Notleidende Zugang zu lebensnotwendiger Hilfe in Form von Nahrungsmitteln, sauberem Wasser und Gesundheitsversorgung erhalten. Der Schutz der Zivilbevölkerung muss Priorität haben.</p><p>Trotz anhaltender politischer und humanitärer Herausforderungen und der unsicheren Lage im Land setzen CARE und seine Partner ihre Hilfe vor Ort fort und leisten in mehreren Regionen des Landes dringend benötigte Unterstützung.

Furthermore, it investigates whether or not the plant was functioning before it was attacked and places the attack in the wider perspective of Yemen’s troubled water situation.</p><p>The images and footage also suggest at least tanks 02 and 04 were nearly completely full of liquid just before the attack.</p><p>It seems likely that the plant was being used up until it was destroyed. It is alleged several people were at the facility, possibly collecting water, when it was struck and at least two of the seven tanks were full of water.</p><p>However there is no hard evidence that Saudi jets or any other member of the Saudi-led coalition responsible for the attacks.</p><p>An alternate perpetrator might be among the wide variety of groups <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/11/aqap-shows-fighting-in-strategic-yemeni-city-in-new-video.php">currently fighting</a> the Houthis for control Salafist of Taʿizz city. For example, a <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=4ad_1452432996">video</a>released in early January 2016 claims to show Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) fighters in Taʿizz engaging with Houthi forces. The footage shows AQAP have truck-mounted recoilless rifles which could possibly have caused the damage to the plant.</p><p>Unfortunately, the attack on the Mocha desalinisation plant is not an isolated in Yemen’s civil war. This a non-exhaustive list of attacks on water infrastructure that occurred in 2015. We have tried to use OSINT to find and verify as much as possible, but we have not been able to verify all of them.</p><p>At present, it is evident that the Mocha sea water desalination plant was attacked, most likely on January 8, 2016. However, we are not able to prove who destroyed the plant. Whoever did it has committed a grievous crime. Taʿizz is water starved and the plant was supposed to be able to supply its population with clean water. Now it is badly damaged if not totally destroyed. This would be terrible in peace time but it is catastrophic given the conditions the citizens of Taʿizz are living under.</p><p>The images circulating online show the aftermath of an attack on the YCD desalination plant north of Mocha. This OSINT investigation has shown that this attack likely took place on January 8, 2016. The plant was probably still functioning when it was attacked, or at the very least had liquid in it – most probably water the citizens of Taʿizz and Mocha could have used – b<em>y Brendan Clifford* and Christiaan Triebert</em></p><p><a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/02/05/yemens-bombed-water-infrastructure/">https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/02/05/yemens-bombed-water-infrastructure/</a></p><p>Comment by Judith Brown: An important article on the attacks on Yemen's water infrastructure, considering who might have caused the attacks.

They include three Unesco World Heritage Sites: Sanaa, Zadib (the capital of Yemen from the 13th to the 15th century) and Shibam (nicknamed “Manhattan in the desert” because of its towers, built in the 16th century). Meanwhile, an Isil suicide bombing in June caused major damage to the Qubat al Mahdi mosque in the capital Sanaa.</p><p>The reasons for the West’s relative indifference to the destruction in Yemen? “Yemeni heritage does not recall classical antiquity, as does Palmyra [in Syria],” says Samir Abdulac, who is chairman of the International Council on Monuments and Sites’ working group for safeguarding cultural heritage in Syria, Iraq and neighbouring countries.</p><p>Politics is another reason for the silence. […]</p><p>“[The Saudi Arabian-led coalition] has been informed since the beginning of the war about sites to avoid, with the co-ordinates provided to them by Unesco,” says Anna Paolini, the director of the Unesco office in Doha, Qatar, representing the Arab states in the Gulf and Yemen. Some heritage sites could have a strategic military interest for the Houthis—sites such as the Medieval fortress of Al Qahera in Taiz, in the southwest of the country, which was destroyed last June.</p><p>Other destroyed sites could have been collateral damage, rather than direct targets­—for example, the ancient site of Baraqish and its recently restored temple and murals. “The coalition had targeted a camp of archaeologists—luckily without anyone inside. Undoubtedly, it imagined it was housing weapons,” Paolini says. “Even in this war context, Saudi Arabia hasn’t justified its hits.”</p><p>Some experts suspect that Saudi Arabia is directly targeting Yemeni heritage. The archaeologist Lamya Khalidi gives the example of the ancient Marib Dam, which was badly damaged last May. She says: “It’s located in a desert zone. Those who know Yemen, as I do, know that it could not have had any strategic interest, and that no one could hide anything there. Saudi Arabia had the co-ordinates of the site, which could not have been hit by accident.”</p><p>Also in May, the Dhamar Regional Museum was pulverised. Around 700 objects were retrieved from the rubble. The attack was justified on the grounds that weapons could have been hidden in the building. “The personnel of Goamm, with whom I have worked for a long time, controlled access to the museum,” Khalidi says. “They had a guard 24 hours a day. How could arms have been deposited there?” – by Marie Zawisza</p><p><a href="http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/yemen-battles-to-save-ancient-heritage-from-destruction/">http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/yemen-battles-to-save-ancient-heritage-from-destruction/</a></p><p>5.2.2016 – Aljazeera (A H)</p><p>Saving Yemen's heritage, 'heart and soul of classical Islamic tradition'</p><p>Professor hopes to digitize 'the collective memory of a people' in manuscripts — before bombs pound them to dust</p><p><a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/2/5/american-professor-in-race-to-save-yemens-cultural-heritage.html">http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/2/5/american-professor-in-race-to-save-yemens-cultural-heritage.html</a></p><p>3.2.2016 – Middle East Eye (* A K)</p><p>Taiz national museum reduced to ash by fighting</p><p>Priceless historical artefacts have been destroyed by the Houthis, residents say</p><p>Heavy Houthi shelling in recent days has sparked a fire in Taiz’s national museum, burning the building and the vast majority of its historical treasures to the ground.</p><p>Manuscripts, an ornate turban said to belong to an unknown but ancient king, old Qurans dating back more than 1,000 years, and private pistols of Imam Ahmed Hamid Al-Deen - the last Yemeni Imam (national religious leader) before Arab nationalists seized power in 1962 - have all been destroyed, local Popular Resistance fighters who oppose the Houthis told MEE.</p><p>A day after the flames had subsided, MEE was able to visit the site.

Thus, what mostly just is “forgotten” in western media, the Houthi for the part of Yemen controlled by them, constituted a provisional government. Labelling them as “rebels” then sounds quite strange and must be seen as a main part of a propagandistic agenda, which only recognizes the Hadi government, not even mentioning the claim of the other side having constituted a government as well.

Salman, 30, currently serves as the country's defense minister, and is considered to be responsible for some of the Kingdom's most brazen behavior, including the ill-fated military operation in Yemen and the execution of Saudi Shia cleric and rights activist Nimr al-Nimr.</p><p>Analyzing the possibility of a power struggle brewing in the secretive kingdom in a <a href="http://ru.journal-neo.org/2016/02/02/saudovskaya-araviya-bor-ba-za-vlast-razgoraetsya/">recent article</a> for the foreign policy journal New Eastern Outlook, Orlov, a political scientist specializing in the Middle East, explained that for starters, any overt attempt by Salman to position his son to succeed him would violate the country's succession laws, and hence effectively amount to a palace coup. </p><p>Abdication in favor of Prince Salman, Orlov writes, would "bypass Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the country's internal affairs minister, and thus violate all [the Kingdom's] traditions of succession. After all, King Salman's son is the deputy crown prince, and his turn for the leadership should hypothetically come after Crown Prince Nayef becomes king, at which point he, Salman, will become crown prince."</p><p>Meanwhile, the country's powerful Succession Council is rumored to be split, with "its members, the elderly princes and the King's closest relatives, too conservative in their views to agree on a new system of succession to the throne, although some of them did agree with the idea 'for the good of the cause'."</p><p>Of course," the political scientist notes, "the costs of such an option are clear and undesirable for the Saudi dynasty, but the alternative could be the beginning of the disintegration of the Kingdom, which is again facing unrest from the Shiite minority, and no money is to be found in the treasury due to a long run of low oil prices."</p><p>In a battle between Deputy Crown Prince Salman and Crown Prince Nayef, things would look good for the young prince, the analyst notes. "Standing behind him are the armed forces and the National Guard, while Crown Prince Nayef has only the ministry of internal affairs and the police at his disposal."</p><p>As for the government, the analyst suggests that "among the country's ministers, the majority are also on Salman's side.</p><p>With most of the cards looking to be in the hands of King Salman and his son, the young prince, one fact which shouldn't be discounted, according to Orlov, is the position of the leaders of the country's tribal groups and clans, "on which the situation 'on the ground' [ultimately] depends." These groups, he recalls, "are lying low in anticipation of what happens in Riyadh. But one thing is clear: the policy of reducing oil prices has hit them where it hurts — their pockets, since they too have their quota on the proceeds of oil exports, and they are extremely dissatisfied with Salman and his family."</p><p>In the final analysis, Orlov notes, "we will not have to wait long for the endgame." The main goal for Saudi authorities, he explains, "will be to prevent the disintegration of the Kingdom following the change of power," since this would "immediately affect the situation in the entire region, where Iraq is already literally falling apart, while Bahrein is on the verge of Shia revolution."</p><p>"And all this occurs against the backdrop of the war in Syria, Yemen and the growing conflict between Riyadh and Tehran, which is gaining momentum, and is fully capable of creating a Shiite crescent –the nightmare of Saudi rulers, as well as the monarchs of Qatar, the UAE and Kuwait."</p><p><a href="http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20160202/1034088377/saudi-palace-coup-analysis.html">http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20160202/1034088377/saudi-palace-coup-analysis.html</a></p><p>Comment: More on the fate of the Saudi monarchy, and especially the possibility of the young and senseless Mohammed bin Salman being the new king.

You never accused the Saudis of bombing civilians and demanded to stop this. On the contrary, the US themselvs furnish air plans, bombs and other weapons, have their advisers in the Saudi control room, help with intelligence, help tanking the Saudi air planes in the air, give political support to Saudis Yemen war. Who just a little time ago went to Riad to trumpet of "eternal friendship" and such stuff? You accuse the Russians of using "dump bombs" killing civilians in Syria.

As a result, instead of seeing images of dead civilians in Iraq, bodybags of U.S. soldiers, and cities and towns razed to the ground, Americans saw statues of Saddam Hussein being torn down, smart-bombs destroying “terrorist” bases and soldiers feeding displaced civilians.</p><p>The government and the media had struck a new deal.</p><p>And this pattern of censorship continues.</p><p>Today, Americans aren’t told that U.S. drones over Pakistan and Afghanistan have killed 147 children during Obama's presidency. But they are inundated with news about an “evil Assad” and Europe’s refugee crisis — which fail to mention that American adventurism is to blame.</p><p>Americans are tricked and confused by government disinformation that is bent on keeping them in a state of ignorance and fear, making them apathetic bystanders to America’s violent actions on the international stage. At the end of the day, most Americans return home, dead-weary from work, numbly hang up their jackets and sit down to dinner, watching the latest sitcom as the TV drowns out their family talk. Meanwhile, in some corner of the world, U.S. missiles continue to pound the earth, as elderly statesmen in Washington whisper of their next reckless crusade. – by Jeff Monson</p><p><a href="http://russia-insider.com/en/media-criticism/russias-not-enemy-us-media/ri12623">http://russia-insider.com/en/media-criticism/russias-not-enemy-us-media/ri12623</a> = <a href="http://www.therussophile.org/russias-not-the-enemy-the-us-media-is.html/">http://www.therussophile.org/russias-not-the-enemy-the-us-media-is.html/</a></p><p>Comment: This negative opinion of US mainstream media is certainly true. Anyway, the European media are not any better. And, not to forget, the Russian ones certainly also will not. – Yemen is not mentioned in this article, but we get a lot of explanation here for the way US (and other western) Mainstream media are dealing with the Yemen war as well.</p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Großbritannien / Great Britain</strong></span></h2><p><strong>4.2.2016 – Global Research (** A P)</strong></p><p><strong>As Yemen Bleeds, British Profits from Weapons Sales “Bury Human Rights”</strong></p><p>The fact that Saudi Arabia executed – including beheadings – forty seven people in one day last month, displaying their bodies from gibbets, failed to deter him from having British military experts to work with their Saudi counterparts, advising on which targets – and which people, it seems – to bomb in Yemen. Parliament has not been consulted, thus, without a chance to debate and vote, democracy too has been suspended.</p><p> The fact that in May 2013 Saudi also beheaded five Yemenis, then used cranes to display their headless bodies against the skyline (Al-Akhbar, 21<sup>st</sup> May 2013) also did not trouble him. Neither did that by 10<sup>th</sup>November 2015, the year’s total of executions had already reached one hundred and fifty one, the highest for twenty years, in what Amnesty International called “a bloody executions spree.”</p><p> But why care about human rights or outright savagery when there are arms to be sold? As written previously, in one three month period last year UK arms sales to Saudi soared by 11,000%.</p><p>Cameron’s government treats such barbarism with astonishing sanguinity. For instance it has come to light that in 2011 the UK drew up a list of thirty: “ ‘priority countries’ where British diplomats would be ‘encouraged’ to ‘proactively drive forward’ and make progress towards abolishing the death penalty over five years.’ “</p><p>Saudi Arabia was not on the list, an omission which Amnesty International’s Head of Policy, Alan Hogarth called “astonishing.”</p><p>What an irony as David Cameron is currently moving heaven and earth to halt legal action against British soldiers accused of acts of extreme human rights abuses in Iraq.</p><p>Worse, the British government is considering taking action against one of the law firms dealing with some of the cases, Leigh Day, with another, Public Interest Lawyers, in their sights. When it comes to hypocrisy, David Cameron is hard to beat.</p><p>Worth noting is that in the UK government’s own list of “countries of humanitarian concern”, according to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT), the UK has sold weapons to twenty four out of twenty seven of them, with Saudi Arabia in a deal to purchase seventy two Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft in a deal worth an eventual £4.5 Billion.</p><p>“Aside from the purchase of the Typhoon jets, major deals between Saudi Arabia and British companies include a £1.6bn agreement for Hawk fighter jets and bulk sales of machine guns, bombs and tear gas.</p><p>“In fact, Saudi Arabia have access to twice as many British-made warplanes as the RAF does, while bombs originally stockpiled by Britain’s Armed Forces are being sent to Saudi Arabia” – to currently decimate Yemen.</p><p>“The overriding message is that human rights are playing second fiddle to company profits,” said CAAT spokesperson Andrew Smith, adding: “The Government and local authorities up and down the country are profiting directly from the bombing of Yemen. Challenging them to divest from Saudi Arabia … is something people can do directly.”</p><p>David Mepham, UK Director of Human Rights Watch commented: “For almost a year, (Foreign Secretary Philip) Hammond has made the false and misleading claim that there is no evidence of laws of war violations by the UK’s Saudi ally and other members of the coalition.”</p><p>The UK Ministry of Defence, declining to say how many UK military advisers were in Saudi Command and Control Centres, said that the UK was: “ … offering Saudi Arabia advice and training on best practice targeting techniques to help ensure continued compliance with International Humanitarian Law.” (Guardian, 27<sup>th</sup> January 2016.) Yet another quote from the ‘You could not make this up’ files.</p><p>It has to be wondered whether the Ministry’s “best practice targeting techniques” includes the near one hundred attacks on medical facilities between March and October 2015, a practice which compelled the International Committee of the Red Cross, in November, to declare the organization: “appalled by the continuing attacks on health care facilities in Yemen …” </p><p>An earlier attempt to have the UN Human rights Council to establish an Inquiry failed due to objections from Saudi Arabia, who, with help from Britain, currently Chairs an influential panel on the same Human Rights Council. Farce is alive and well in the corridors of the UN.</p><p>However, in spite of the horrors under which Yemenis suffering and dying, and Saudi’s appalling human rights deficit, UK Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood, an American-born former soldier, in a visit to Saudi Arabia last month was quoted in the country’s Al Watan newspaper as revealing: “ the ignorance of the British to the notable progress in Saudi Arabia in the field of human rights, confirming throughout the visit of a British FCO delegation… that he had expressed his opinion regarding the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia before the British Parliament, and that the notable progress in this area has been obscured.” (See 6: “Saudi Arabia urged to make more of its human rights successes by Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood.”)</p><p>The Foreign Office strongly denied that Ellwood had expressed such a view.</p><p>The Saudi led, British advised and US ”intelligence” provided coalition is reported to have formed “an independent team of experts” to assess “incidents” (which should be described as outrages and war crimes) in order to reach “conclusions, lessons learned …” etc. Thus, as ever, the arsonist is to investigate the cause of the fire. – by Felix Arbuthnot</p><p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/as-yemen-bleeds-british-profits-from-weapons-sales-bury-human-rights/5505461">http://www.globalresearch.ca/as-yemen-bleeds-british-profits-from-weapons-sales-bury-human-rights/5505461</a></p><p>Comment: The most damning report I've seen of Cameron's human rights record by the hard hitting Felicity Arbuthnot.

Zunächst mit den in dem UN-Bericht erwähnten Menschenrechtsverletzungen. Insgesamt 119 Mal habe die Koalition gegen internationales Recht verstoßen, steht dort zu lesen. Flugzeuge hätten auch von Zivilisten bewohnte Gebiete beschossen.</p><p>Vor allem aber musste Ellwood dem Parlament erklären, warum Großbritannien in großem Stil Waffen an Saudi-Arabien verkauft – und zwar auch solche, die sich in einem Angriffskrieg einsetzen lassen. Allein in den vergangenen Monaten waren aus Großbritannien Waffen im Wert von drei Milliarden Pfund nach Saudi-Arabien gekommen. “Darunter auch Bomben und Raketen für eine Million Pfund in der Zeit von Juli bis September 2015″, heißt es in der entsprechenden Anfrage der britischen Parlamentsmitglieder.</p><p>Man nehme den Bericht sehr ernst, versicherte Staatssekretär Ellwood den Abgeordneten. Mehr könne er zu dem Report allerdings kaum sagen, erklärte er. “Wir haben den Text offiziell noch nicht erhalten”, erklärte er. “Ja, ich habe ihn bekommen, aber ich habe ihn noch nicht erhalten,” erklärte er – und lieferte damit das, was die Zeitung “The Guardian” dann “eine Farce” nannte.</p><p><a href="http://www.goldenactive.de/?p=15508">http://www.goldenactive.de/?p=15508</a></p><p>26.11.2015 – Armament Research (* B K P)</p><p>United Arab Emirates employ British Hakim A series precision guided munitions in Yemen</p><p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/11/25/yemen-coalition-used-uk-cruise-missile-unlawful-airstrike">Recent</a> <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/11/yemen-coalition-used-uk-cruise-missile-in-unlawful-airstrike/">reports</a> from advocacy organisations have drawn public attention to the presence of UK-manufactured munitions employed by UAE forces during an airstrike in Matnah, south-west of Sana’a City, Yemen, on 23 September 2015.
