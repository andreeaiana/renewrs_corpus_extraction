It finds that the protracted conflict has, on the one hand, pushed more women into the workforce and new labor markets, in some cases into professions previously dominated by men. While some women have established new enterprises, often home-based businesses, others have engaged in poorly paid physical work in response to the economic crisis and the loss of male breadwinners. On the other hand, the war has imposed new constraints on an already low women’s participation rate.</p><p>This policy brief recommends that micro-economic initiatives to bring women into the workforce must be accompanied by long-term efforts to address socio-economic structures that have historically constrained women’s access to the workforce. Interventions must be guided by local consultations with women and men from all demographics, and must promote work that is fairly paid and provides security and social protection. Quota systems could ensure that women play an active role in recovery and reconstruction efforts; women must also be engaged at all decision-making levels in peace building efforts and in post-conflict Yemen.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Yemen has one of the lowest female labor force participation rates in the world. The conflict-driven economic collapse has devastated Yemen’s labor market, and available data suggest that working women were initially harder hit by the conflict than their male counterparts; proportionally, more women lost their jobs while women-owned businesses were more vulnerable to closing down. Subsequently, however, the prolonged war has pushed more women into the workforce, often through financial necessity due to the economic crisis and the loss of male breadwinners rather than any planned economic empowerment for women.</p><p>During the conflict, women have started new enterprises, often home-based businesses, or entered professions like waitressing or retail which were previously dominated by men. The humanitarian response in Yemen has created new employment for women, while some women have been employed in security forces for parties to the conflict. Yemeni women have been pushed into poorly paid, informal physical labor like domestic work, while others have been forced into negative coping mechanisms such as begging. </p><p>This policy brief surveys these emerging trends and introduces principles to guide efforts to sustain potential gains in women’s labor force participation and to improve access to decent work for all women in post-conflict Yemen.</p><p>Overview of the Labor Force in Yemen</p><p>Yemen’s labor force is largely uneducated and informal, with a low labor force participation rate.<span><sup><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/7721#_ftn1">[1]</a></sup></span> It is characterized by a mismatch between workers’ qualifications and their roles, and high unemployment.</p><p>According to an ILO labor force survey conducted in 2013-2014, only 6 percent of women participated in the labor force prior to the conflict, while just 7 percent of jobs were held by women. In 2013, higher education levels were linked to greater workforce participation for women. Some 62.1 percent of women with a university education were part of the workforce in Yemen, compared with just 4.5 percent of those with a primary education or lower. The ILO survey found that of the 293,000 women employed before the conflict, around half worked in agriculture, either as dairy and livestock producers or field crop and vegetable growers, while around one third were employed in the service industry. More than one-third of women worked in family businesses, compared with less than one-tenth of men.</p><p>Multiple factors have hindered women’s entry into the workforce. Yemen has placed last in the Global Gender Gap report every year for the last decade, signalling the country’s significant gender-based disparities.</p><p>Cultural values limiting women’s interaction with men outside the family have limited the types of work that women could perform, and women’s employment options have been largely restricted to “feminine” jobs such as clerks, secretaries, teachers and nurses.</p><p>The Impact of War on Women in the Workforce</p><p>The current conflict has devastated Yemen’s economy, leaving millions of Yemenis unable to afford basic necessities; the economic collapse has driven the humanitarian catastrophe. Yemen’s economy has contracted by an estimated 50 percent</p><p>The conflict-driven challenges to the labor market have had multifaceted impacts on women. Research suggests that initially, the war affected a larger proportion of women in the labor force than men. In 2015, male employment had declined by 11 percent, while female employment had fallen by 28 percent.</p><p><span><a href="http://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/7721">http://sanaacenter.org/publications/main-publications/7721</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>The UAE's Yemen withdrawal leaves Saudi Arabia exposed</strong></p><p>Without Abu Dhabi's direct military intervention in the fight against the Houthis, Saudi Arabia must contend with its own record of countless mistakes in Yemen</p><p>Against the backdrop of US lawmakers repudiating the Saudi- and Emirati-led military campaign in Yemen, the UAE’s efforts to distance itself from the negative political fallout are pragmatic - especially given the spectre of President Donald Trump losing his re-election bid next year to a Democratic challenger. </p><p>Although much of the criticism of US arms sales to Arab states<span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/08/saudi-arabia-trump-weapon-arms-sales-must-be-stopped"> pertain</a></span> to Saudi Arabia, deals with the UAE are also coming under greater scrutiny.</p><p>Growing pushback from London on the Yemen war is also a factor. Last month, the UK High Court <span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/uk-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-declared-unlawful-by-court-of-appeal/a-49275933">ruled</a></span> that British arms licenses to Riyadh were “unlawful”, with major implications for other capitals involved in the Arab coalition, including Abu Dhabi.</p><p>The UAE is determined to remain a major player in Yemen, fighting its enemies and consolidating its influence via proxy. Even with most Emirati troops pulled out, there <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/yemen-uae-reduce-troop-presence-consulting-riyadh-190708155534616.html">will remain</a></span> 90,000 UAE-trained/allied Yemeni fighters.</p><p>These proxies - comprised of tribesmen, former security forces and southern separatists - will continue receiving weaponry and money from the UAE, which remains committed to its ambitions of effectively controlling key port infrastructure in Yemen.</p><p>As the renowned Emirati political scientist Abdulkhaleq Abdulla <span><a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/uae-drawdown-yemen-welcome-step-it-needs-be-reciprocated">wrote</a></span>: “The final consideration leading the UAE to draw down its forces in Yemen is its confidence in the Yemeni local forces to continue confronting the Houthis on their own. The UAE has already trained a total of 90,000 Yemeni forces who are capable of filling the vacuum and supporting the legitimate Yemeni government. They can do the job and are well trained, well equipped, and battle tested.”</p><p>International outrage</p><p>Where does the UAE’s evolving Yemen foreign policy leave Saudi Arabia? Despite Riyadh and Abu Dhabi being extremely close allies, their differences vis-a-vis Yemen have been no secret. </p><p>For years, the Emiratis have sponsored <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/21/yemen-uae-united-arab-emirates-profiting-from-chaos-of-civil-war">southern separatists</a></span> who reject the legitimacy of Yemen’s UN-recognised president, Abd Rabbuh Hadi, who joins Riyadh in seeking to preserve Yemen’s north-south unity. Despite speculation that such clashing agendas could lead to a major crack in the Arab coalition, that has not happened - at least not publicly.</p><p>Weakness and division</p><p>Iran and the Houthi rebels will likely further exploit the UAE’s withdrawal for propaganda purposes. After several months of the Houthis demonstrating their advancements in drone and missile technology, proven by their attacks against strategic Saudi <span><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/yemen-s-houthis-say-they-launched-drone-attack-on-saudi-s-jizan-airport-1.7534494">targets</a></span>, the Iranians and Houthis will seek to portray the UAE’s pullout as a sign of weakness and division on the Arab coalition’s part.</p><p>Ultimately, the UAE’s withdrawal is informative of underlying divisions that were present in the Arab coalition from the outset. For Abu Dhabi, establishing a UAE-friendly administration in Aden has been more important than the question of Yemen’s Houthi-controlled north. </p><p>Yet, for Saudi Arabia, the prospects of the Houthis consolidating power in northern Yemen has direct implications for the kingdom’s own border security - far more than for the UAE.</p><p>Yet, with the UAE withdrawing most of its forces from Yemen, Abu Dhabi has left Riyadh with a major dilemma. Saudi Arabia’s national security is truly threatened by the Houthis, and this danger will only increase as the Iran-allied insurgents make further advancements in their drone and missile capabilities.</p><p>Without the UAE’s direct military intervention in the fight against the Houthis, Riyadh must contend with its record of countless mistakes in Yemen, which have led to Saudi Arabia being more isolated in a conflict that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman now fully owns – by Ali Hussein Bakeer</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-will-riyadh-cope-uaes-yemen-withdrawal">https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-will-riyadh-cope-uaes-yemen-withdrawal</a></span></p><p>My remark: More at cp2.</p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: Trump’s Middle East Policy Could Push Yemen’s Houthis into Iran’s Hands</strong></p><p>As both the United States and Saudi Arabia continue to wage war and impose economic blockades on both Yemen and Iran, it is likely that the Houthis’ political alliance with Iran against their common enemies will grow, turning the fears of both the Saudi Arabia and the United States into a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>Leaders of Yemen’s Houthi (Ansar Allah) movement traded barbs with U.S. President Donald Trump this week after the president made remarks renewing his support for the Saudi-led coalition war and expressed a desire for Iran to “get out of Yemen.”</p><p>Trump provided no evidence to back his assertion that Iranian personnel are operating in Yemen and so far no evidence has been provided by the U.S. to back the claim.</p><p>Mohamed Abdulsalam, the spokesman for the Houthis, <span><a href="https://twitter.com/abdusalamsalah/status/1151200305155104769">wrote on Twitter</a></span> following Trump’s comments that what the U.S. president said contradicts reality and facts and does not deserve a response. Abdulsalam reminded Trump of the U.S.’ own involvement in Yemen</p><p>For their part, the Houthis have never denied their political alliance with Iran, one of the few countries to consistently and openly challenge the legitimacy of the now more than four-year-old Saudi-led war on Yemen. Yet, the Houthis and the Iranian government both insist that Iran has never sent troops, military advisors or weapons to the Houthis and the Saudi-led Coalition – despite its control over large swaths of Yemen and the presence of its U.S-backed intelligence apparatus in the country – has never been able to provide hard evidence of an Iranian presence on the ground.</p><p>As with any political alliance, a level of cooperation between Iran and the Houthis does exist. After the Houthis were successful in leading the movement to oust the Saudi-backed Hadi government from Yemen, Iran and the Houthis<span><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/files/how_yemens_post_2011_transitional_phase_ended_in_war_en.pdf">brokered a deal</a></span> to begin weekly passenger flights between the two countries. The flights, which only lasted for one week, drew the ire of Saudi Arabia who subsequently used military force put an end to flights between Tehran and Sana’a and ultimately blockaded the Sana’a Airport completely, leading to a<span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/with-airport-closed-by-saudis-yemeni-patients-face-death-from-untreated-wounds-and-disease/248607/"> crippling humanitarian crisis</a></span>. Houthi government figures still occasionally fly to Iran to attend talks, and some are thought to own property in the county.</p><p>A <span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/b406265e1c6642fd9a614416270263b6">2018 report</a></span> by the United Nations Security Council accused Iran of illegally shipping fuel to the Houthi government in Yemen. The report claims that the fuel was then sold and the proceeds used to purchase weapons that the Houthis used in their fight against the Saudi-led coalition. UN experts say that by providing fuel to the Houthis, Iran is “violating a UN arms embargo” and “directly or indirectly providing missiles and drones to the Houthis.” If Iran indeed did supply fuel to the Houthis, the move would be unlikely to change the balance of power in the Yemen war as Saudi Arabia spent over $80 billion on advanced weapons purchases from the United States in 2018 alone. They also enjoy U.S logistical and intelligence support in its war on the country. </p><p>Houthi reliance on Tehran for weapons is also unnecessary as the country is <span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/gun-control-yemen-style/273058/">so awash in weapons</a></span> that the risk of attempting to smuggle them in from Iran would not only be a foolhardy venture for the Houthis, it would provide little benefit as the movement already has a sizable arsenal that it inherited from the government of former Houthi ally, the late Ali Abdullah Saleh.</p><p>There is, undoubtedly, a convergence of interests between the Houthis and Iran</p><p>Fiercely independent: the Houthis’ grass roots</p><p>The Houthis, who refer to themselves as Ansar Allah, have always been proud and fiercely independent.

Diese Kriegsallianz hat zahlreiche Verbrechen begangen, Verbrechen, die gegen drei wichtige Prinzipien des internationalen Völkerrechtes verstoßen.</p><p>Verstoß gegen den Grundsatz der militärischen Notwendigkeit</p><p>Das Internationale Rote Kreuz deutet die militärische Notwendigkeit, welche in den Zusatzprotokollen von 1977 zum Genfer Abkommen gefordert wird, damit, dass nur Maßnahmen, die zur Erreichung eines wichtigen militärischen Ziels erforderlich werden, erlaubt sind. In einem Krieg darf ein Angreifer nur so viel Gewalt anwenden wie für die Besiegung des Feindes notwendig ist. Kriegsmaßnahmen sind nur gegen militärische Ziele erlaubt. Sie dürfen kein unnötiges Leid hervorrufen und nicht auf Heimtücke beruhen. Dieses Prinzip der militärischen Notwendigkeit soll der Vermeidung des unnötigen ziellosen Einsatzes von Gewalt dienen.</p><p>Die Verbrechen der saudischen Kriegsallianz in den vergangenen 52 Monaten bilden jedoch einen klaren Verstoß gegen dieses völkerrechtliche Prinzip.</p><p>Verstoß gegen das Prinzip der Angemessenheit</p><p>Unter dem Prinzip der Angemessenheit von Kriegsmaßnahmen ist zu verstehen, dass Militärschläge nicht derartig große Schäden an Zivilpersonen und Einrichtungen hervorrufen dürfen, dass sie in keinem Verhältnis mehr zu dem von der Militärmaßnahme erwarteten militärischen Vorteil stehen. </p><p>Verstoß gegen das Unterscheidungsprinzip</p><p>Zu den Grundprinzipien des internationalen Völkerrechtes gehört auch das Unterscheidungsprinzip. Die Zivilbevölkerung genießt wegen Nichtbeteiligung am Krieg die Unterstützung des Internationalen Völkerrechtes und muss sich jenseits der Militärmaßnahmen des Feindes befinden.</p><p>Aber in den vergangenen 52 Monaten hat die saudisch angeführte Kriegsallianz nicht nur laufend Angriffe auf die Zivilisten durchgeführt, sondern überhaupt gar keine Unterscheidung vorgenommen und absichtlich zivile Ziele angegriffen.</p><p>Obwohl die saudisch geführte Anti-Jemen-Allianz die eindeutigen Prinzipien des Völkerrechts, die während eines Krieges beachtet werden müssen, verletzen und gemäß UN-Generalsekretär Antonio Guterres die größte menschliche Tragödie der letzten Jahrzehnte auf der Welt hervorgerufen haben, hat noch kein relevantes internationales Organ , auch nicht die UNO oder der Internationale Gerichtshof, einen herausragenden Schritt gegenüber diesen Verbrechen unternommen und es haben nicht einmal unabhängige Untersuchungen über diese Verbrechen stattgefunden. <span><a href="http://parstoday.com/de/news/uncategorised-i48226-die_menschenrechtsverstöße_der_saudisch_angeführten_jemen_kriegsallianz">http://parstoday.com/de/news/uncategorised-i48226-die_menschenrechtsverstöße_der_saudisch_angeführten_jemen_kriegsallianz</a></span></p><p><span>(B P)</span></p><p><span>In its mid-year report, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemeni?src=hashtag_click">#Yemeni</a> journalists syndicate documented 62 violations against the press, including torture, detentions of and assaults on journalists by Houthi militia and government.

Its use is widespread: whether in business meetings, social events, or family evenings, Yemeni males are prone to sport a massive bulge in either cheek at any given time of day. Around ninety percent of males chew khat openly, while an estimated fifty percent of females chew in private circumstances.</p><p>However, just as many Westerners ignore advice against the use of controlled substances, arguments against khat use fall mostly upon deaf ears within Yemen's borders.</p><p>Khat's social cost could be dismissed as a case of a divergence in social norms, if not for its corresponding opportunity cost. <span><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ym.html">Less than three percent of Yemeni territory is arable</a></span>. While 41.7% of Yemeni territory qualifies as pasturage, Yemen's capacity to feed its population of nearly thirty million would be strictly limited under ideal circumstances. </p><p>Just as Afghans elect to grow opium and cannabis in lieu of food crops like wheat or pomegranates, Yemeni farmers dedicate scarce arable land and irrigation resources to khat. Farmers surrender their opportunity to grow subsistence crops like mangoes or pears, or cash crops like coffee or cotton, for the sake of khat. However, unlike Afghanistan’s lucrative illicit cultivation, Yemen has little to no khat export market upon which to prevail. Yemeni farmers produce khat almost entirely for domestic consumption.</p><p>Unfortunately, this important context offers little in the way of solutions. Instead, it undermines the insinuations that Saudi forces are deliberately aggravating Yemen's humanitarian crisis - or that the humanitarian crisis can be brought to a swift end by curtailing international support to the Saudi-led intervention.</p><p>The various Yemeni factions involved in the ongoing conflict are well aware of where Yemen's food is grown, and where Yemen's imported food comes ashore</p><p><span><a href="https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/role-khat-yemens-humanitarian-crisis">https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/role-khat-yemens-humanitarian-crisis</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Now is time to double-down on the political process in Yemen, says Anwar Gargash</p><p>Dr. Anwar Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs has said that the UAE always understood the challenges in Yemen, noting that "there was no easy victory and there will be no easy peace."</p><p>In an op-ed published in The Washington Post (yesterday) July 22nd 2019, Dr. Gargash stated that as the country redeploys its forces in Yemen, it is seeking to "double down on the political process," adding that the "Yemeni parties, the Houthis specifically, should see this move as a confidence-building measure to create new momentum to end the conflict."</p><p>The UAE Minister went on to affirm that the "UAE and the rest of coalition are not leaving Yemen," and will remain to continue to advise and assist local Yemeni forces. "We will respond to attacks against the coalition and against neighbouring states. With international partners, we will stay vigilant in securing access to critical waterways."</p><p>Gargash also highlighted the Coalition's success in preventing Iran from gaining a strategic maritime chokehold in the region, hence protecting the freedom of navigation between Asia and the Mediterranean through the Bab el-Mandeb strait, the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.</p><p>He also noted the success of effectively neutralising the threat from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), "one of the terrorist group’s most dangerous franchises."</p><p>Below is the article in full as it appeared on the Washington Post:</p><p>As the United Arab Emirates draws down and redeploys its forces in Yemen, we do so in the same way we began, with eyes wide open. We understood the challenges then and we understand them today. There was no easy victory and there will be no easy peace.</p><p>But now is the time to double down on the political process. The Yemeni parties, the Houthis specifically, should see this move for what it is: a confidence-building measure to create new momentum to end the conflict. The international community also must seize the moment. It must deter any side from exploiting or undermining this opportunity, stop the Houthis from blocking aid, hasten compromise from all sides and support a determined U.N.-led mediation effort.</p><p>In the meantime, there will be no security vacuum. The government of Yemen’s military carried the greatest burden in taking back control of large parts of the country. These local units will remain in place under Yemeni command and with ongoing support from the coalition.</p><p>[….]</p><p>But just to be clear, the UAE and the rest of coalition are not leaving Yemen. While we will operate differently, our military presence will remain. In accordance with international law, we will continue to advise and assist local Yemeni forces. We will respond to attacks against the coalition and against neighboring states. With international partners, we will stay vigilant in securing access to critical waterways. Having donated more than $5.5 billion in aid to Yemen since 2015, our support for large-scale humanitarian assistance programmes, as well as U.N. and international organisations working in the country will continue.</p><p>Martin Griffiths, the United Nations special envoy, told the Security Council last week that "we need to think now together of the realities and opportunities which now define our chances of making a move on peace."</p><p>The coalition’s latest moves improve these chances. Military force alone will never solve Yemen’s Rubik’s Cube of conflicts and constantly shifting alliances, but is has created the conditions for a reenergised peace process.</p><p><span><a href="http://wam.ae/en/details/1395302776096">http://wam.ae/en/details/1395302776096</a> = <a href="https://gulfnews.com/opinion/op-eds/were-proud-of-the-uaes-military-role-in-yemen-1.65387763">https://gulfnews.com/opinion/op-eds/were-proud-of-the-uaes-military-role-in-yemen-1.65387763</a></span></p><p>and also <span><a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/gargash-military-force-alone-won-t-solve-yemen-s-conflict-1.889670">https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/gargash-military-force-alone-won-t-solve-yemen-s-conflict-1.889670</a></span></p><p>My comment: Let’s see how great the difference between fact and fiction really is.

Now that the UAE is withdrawing its ground forces, can one say that the Houthis are actually winning this war? And what role are the Sudanese forces, which are said to number 30,000, playing in all of this?</p><p><em>PATRICK COCKBURN: </em>Well, the Houthis haven’t lost, which is the main fact about this. Remember that in 2015 when Crown Prince— well, now he’s Crown Prince— Mohammad bin Salman started this war, he was the Saudi Defense Minister at the time and was bidding to become the effective ruler of the country. He expected and they said they expected an immediate victory. He had himself pictured in military uniform. This was to be a victory that was to assist him in his grab for power and it’s never happened. They’re still there four years later despite pressure from Saudi Arabia mainly in the form of aerial bombing. We’ve had 90,000 people killed in Yemen. We have millions of people on the edge of starvation. We have an enormous cholera epidemic, which is worse this year. Half a million people have it, more than last year.</p><p>So the Houthis have managed to survive although they’re pretty isolated. They’re often referred to as the Iranian-backed Houthis. But in terms of military equipment, there’s very little backing from Iran, the place the weapons come from. Yemen has always been a very big arms market. They buy the weapons. So they’ve, sort of, won by not losing. The UAE, the United Arab Emirates, has achieved its war aims largely, and it’s also just fed up with being caught up in this stalemate. So they are withdrawing or have withdrawn already.</p><p><em>GREG WILPERT</em> : Well, that’s an interesting question that you bring up. I mean, you said that the UAE achieved its war aims. What were those aims?</p><p><em>PATRICK COCKBURN: </em>Well, they wanted to get substantive control of the Port of Aden, one already big port at the mouth of the Red Sea. They’ve sort of done that. They wanted to get—Yemen used to be two countries with South Yemen and North Yemen up to 1990 when they united, but they later fought a civil war when the south tried to secede.

But even their economies are completely different (also linked to the territory and size), and even from a tribal and population point of view they are different: for example, Saudi Arabia has an important Shiite minority, which in the Emirates is now almost non-existent and completely absorbed ", continues Bianco.</p><p>"These differences in reality, perspective and perceptions translate into different approaches to issues such as the war in Yemen, or the crisis in Sudan, the confrontation with Iran or the relationship with the United States, and have always existed, precisely because they are structural ”- adds the Italian analyst, one of the leading European experts on the Arab region. "The point is that with respect to these nuances in detail or in the executive plan, the goals of the two policy makers , the Saudi Moahmmed bin Salman and the emirate Mohammed bin Zayed (also MbS and MbZ, ed ), remain common. This is what has kept them together so far, besides the fact that they need each other ”.</p><p>What is this mutual necessity connected to, and how does it unfold? "For example, the Saudi needs MbZ because the UAE is more experienced, and is therefore better equipped in the strategy: MbS realizes it, and feels it can trust Abu Dhabi more than it can with some elements of the Saudi senior establishment, because bin Zayed wants bin Salman to come to the throne, because he considers him his man in Saudi Arabia. "</p><p>Saudi Arabia seems to need the Arab Emirates, but we said that this need is reciprocal: so, in Abu Dhabi? "Bin Zayed knows that the Saudi kingdom is a great country that has capabilities and tools of projection on some issues where the Emirates do not have (we think of the legitimacy of sovereignty in Mecca and Medina, or the strong financial instrument). In addition, Riad is often used as a shield. Take the case of the war in Yemen and the question of civilian casualties: the war ended on everybody's lips and it was the Saudis who took the blame, while MbZ was fairly free ".</p><p>Here, in fact: the war in Yemen is also a theme behind the international relations of these two countries</p><p><span><a href="https://formiche.net/2019/07/riad-abu-dhabi-bianco/">https://formiche.net/2019/07/riad-abu-dhabi-bianco/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p><span>Audio: </span>Jemen-Krieg: Saudisch geführte Militärkoalition zerbröckelt</p><p>Es wird einsam für Saudi-Arabien im Jemen.

But, more plausibly, the timing of the withdrawal seems more to do with the UAE redeploying forces at the behest of the United States in order to ramp up military pressure on Iran.</p><p>If the US is indeed lining up for a military strike on Iran, then it would require its regional allies to be mobilized as part of a coalition. The naval coalition being proposed by the Pentagon thus takes on a sinister implication, in spite of the apparently benign “freedom of navigation” claims invoked as its purpose.</p><p>The abrupt pullout of UAE forces from Yemen may therefore be less about giving peace a chance, or even about cutting and running from a futile, un-winnable war. Instead, the Emiratis seem to be reconfiguring their forces do Washington’s bidding for a war on Iran.</p><p>After all, the Gulf Arab propaganda claims that the Houthi rebels in Yemen are “Iranian proxies”. For them, Yemen has always been about challenging Iran. Pulling forces to redeploy with the US in the Gulf may seem a more appealing, if high-risk, direct way to confront Iran. Furthermore, the UAE gets to play top dog over their petty Saudi rival in pleasing Uncle Sam.</p><p>Unfortunately, peace is not about to break out in Yemen because of the UAE military pullout.

Arabia, UAE Throw Stones into Neighboring Yemen Equipped with Ballistic Missiles, Explosive Drones</p><p>Shaker Ameer, Yemeni journalist and activist, says Riyadh is dependent upon oil and Hajj income, and the UAE “is a mason empire of capitalism that depends on the attraction of foreign investments”, making them increasingly concerned about their fragile security which easily severely undermined by Yemeni missiles or drones strike.</p><p>Speaking in an exclusive interview with FNA, Shaker Amin Shaker said “from the rubbles of our houses struck by the coalition's jet fighters we could have stood up again on our feet with a faithful will to defeat the enemy and take a revenge for the shattered bodies of our women, children and elderly people.”</p><p>Commenting on importance of the drone strikes, he noted “That is the correct definition of effectiveness when you turn to be able to strike deep inside the enemy's own territories after they announced full destruction of your military capabilities.”</p><p><span><a href="http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980427000874">http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980427000874</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>After Yemen, the UAE’s next target could be Libya</p><p>Although the UAE official said that the drawdown “was not a last-minute decision” and had been discussed extensively with Riyadh, this move is likely to cause some tension between the allies. Ever since the murder of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in his country’s Consulate in Istanbul back in October, we can say that this has been a period when Abu Dhabi has started to feel that it wants to distance itself from the Saudis, at least temporarily. </p><p>Moreover, the increasing outrage at the war in Yemen in the aftermath of Khashoggi’s murder, which added to the pressure on the coalition members, appears to have sent a message to the UAE leadership that there is no reason for its troops to remain there any longer. This may have been from the perspective of the coalition not achieving its military goals and failing to set out a plan to end the war, meaning that matters will be complicated even further. </p><p>Now, after the UAE’s drawdown announcement, it is likely that Libya, which is increasingly becoming the new battlefield for the main players in the region, will be Abu Dhabi’s next target. On 27 March, a few days before the reconciliation conference took place, renegade Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar visited Saudi Arabia, where he met King Salman and the Crown Prince. It is believed that Haftar was given the green light from Riyadh to carry on with a military assault on the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli. The assault was launched upon Haftar’s return to Libya.</p><p>Since Libya’s strongman started his military offensive to seize the capital, the chances of a reconciliation taking place any time soon have disappeared. This suggests that the Saudi-UAE axis does not want to see stability in any Arab country and is prepared to use force to ensure this.</p><p>Washington’s policy on the issue remains unclear and contradictory. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190719-after-yemen-the-uaes-next-target-could-be-libya/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190719-after-yemen-the-uaes-next-target-could-be-libya/</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp2a Saudische Blockade / Saudi blockade</span></h2><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>US-Saudi Forces Detain Oil Tanker Supplying Hodeidah’s Power Plant</p><p>A source in the naval navigation said Monday that the coalition of aggression, since three days, has been holding an oil tanker (Maximus) supplying the Hodeidah's electricity plant.</p><p>The source explained that although the tanker has received a permit from the United Nations to enter the port of Hodeidah, the forces of aggression prevented its delivery.</p><p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=7944">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=7944</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp3 Humanitäre Lage / Humanitarian situation</span></h2><p><span>Siehe / Look at cp1</span></p><p>(* B H)</p><p>Random shell leaves Yemeni girl amputated</p><p>More than 7,500 children have been killed or wounded in Yemen since 2014</p><p>“A shell fired by Houthi rebels hit as I was climbing a tree near my house,” Hadil told Anadolu Agency.</p><p>The Yemeni child was rushed to a hospital in the southern city of Aden for medical treatment.</p><p>"When I saw my hands wrapped with bandages, I never thought that they were amputated and that I won't be able to write or draw again," the shocked girl said, with tears rolling down her checks.</p><p>“I could not believe that I will not have hands anymore.”</p><p>A UN report said that more than 7,500 children have been killed or wounded in Yemen since 2014.</p><p><a href="https://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/random-shell-leaves-yemeni-girl-amputated-3496243">https://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/random-shell-leaves-yemeni-girl-amputated-3496243</a></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Jemen: „Die Kinder leben und spielen im Müll“</p><p>„Krieg, Elend und Hunger sind überall zu sehen: In den zerschossenen Häusern, im Müll auf den Straßen, in dem Kinder wühlen, im ausgemergelten Körper eines 12-jährigen Mädchens, das nicht mehr gehen und sprechen kann“, sagt CARE-Helferin <span><a href="https://twitter.com/jennbose">Jennifer Bose.</a></span> Sie ist derzeit im Jemen.</p><p><span>Als eine der wenigen Hilfsorganisationen ist CARE vor Ort und leistet humanitäre Hilfe.</span> Mehr als 24 Millionen Menschen im Land sind auf Hilfe angewiesen, rund 7,4 Millionen benötigen Nahrungsmittelhilfe in der größten humanitären Krise weltweit.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.care.at/spenden/online-spenden/#online-spenden-fuer-care">Bitte helfen Sie mit einer Spende!</a></span></p><p>„Was mich neben dem Krieg und dem Leid in der Hafenstadt Aden am meisten erschüttert, sind die Berge von Müll“, berichtet Jennifer Bose. „Die Menschen leben darin und die Kinder spielen dort.

Ferner wird zum Schluss das außenpolitische Verhalten der beiden Schlüsselakteure der Region daraufhin überprüft, inwieweit sie für die Destabilisierung des Nahen Ostens verantwortlich sind. Dieser Artikel beruht auf handfesten Fakten und Daten.</p><p>Menschenrechtsverletzungen in Saudi-Arabien</p><p>Die Rechte von Frauen, Kindern und Migranten sind stark eingeschränkt. Frauen stehen in Saudi-Arabien unter einem Vormund und dürfen ohne dessen Erlaubnis nicht reisen, einen Pass besitzen, heiraten oder sich gewissen medizinischen Behandlungen unterziehen. Der Ehemann kann sie verstoßen und behält das Recht auf die Erziehung der Kinder. Nur <span><a href="https://bit.ly/2LinCQt">mit seiner Erlaubnis</a></span> kann die Mutter das Kind sehen.</p><p>Es herrschen strenge Kleidungsvorschriften und auch Touristen müssen sich in abgeschwächter Form daran halten. Aufgrund der strikten Geschlechtertrennung dürfen Frauen nicht mit Männern, die nicht zu ihrer Familie gehören, einkaufen und ins Restaurant gehen. Berufsausübung bzw. -wahl bedürfen der ausdrücklichen Zustimmung eines "Beschützers". Was das Familienrecht betrifft, darf der Mann legal vier Frauen heiraten, die er ohne eine rechtliche Rechtfertigung verstoßen kann.</p><p>Folter und Misshandlungen sowie erzwungene Geständnisse sind an der Tagesordnung. </p><p>Menschenrechtsverletzungen in der Islamischen Republik Iran</p><p>Allein zwischen März und Dezember 2013 sind etwa 31.000 Mädchen unter fünfzehn Jahren verheiratet worden. Das sind mehr als vier Mal so viele wie 2011, als <span><a href="https://bit.ly/2XZDfSS">7.440 solcher Kinderehen gezählt wurden</a></span>. Männer dürfen - wie im Koran festgelegt (<span><a href="http://islam.de/1411.php">Sure 4, Vers 3</a></span>) - vier Frauen haben und dazu noch eine unbegrenzte Zahl an Zeitehen (Mutʿa-Ehe, Sigheh) <span><a href="https://bit.ly/2Y3csVL">eingehen</a></span>. Unzählige legale und illegale "Firmen" leben von der Vermittlung von Zeitehen. In dem Dokumentarfilm "Iran - Im Bazar der Geschlechter" aus dem Jahr 2010 stellt die österreichische Filmemacherin mit iranischen Eltern, Sudabeh Mortezai, diese Heiratsart <span><a href="https://bit.ly/2LiVMn8">sehr präzise</a></span> dar.</p><p>Das seit 2013 gültige neue iranische Strafgesetzbuch enthält <span><a href="https://bit.ly/2xIpMjA">menschenverachtende Gesetze</a></span>. Diese Gesetze, insbesondere jedoch die Praxis der Vollstreckung, übersteigt das menschliche Vorstellungsvermögen. </p><p>Die Grundlagen des islamischen Strafgesetzbuches sind "Diskriminierung", "Gewalt aufgrund der Diskriminierung" und eine Kampfansage gegen die Gleichheit der Menschen im Hinblick auf Geschlecht, Glauben, Religion, Gewissen und dem Grad an Loyalität oder der Kritik der Opposition an der offiziellen Politik. Im Allgemeinen verletzt dieses Gesetz die Menschenwürde massiv und verbreitet Gewalt in allen Teilen der Gesellschaft. </p><p><span>Schlussfolgerung</span></p><p>Iran und Saudi-Arabien gehören zu den die Menschenrechte massiv verletzenden Staaten. Dabei fanden, wie es veranschaulicht wurde, im Iran die grausamen Gesetze und Praktiken erst seit der Herrschaft der Mullahs im Iran in 1979 Anwendung.</p><p>Diesen wichtigen Hintergrund übersehen meiner Ansicht nach populistische Journalisten und Wissenschaftler.

The existence of independent human rights groups is forbidden, as well as public gatherings and demonstrations.

Admittedly, that policy is not very well articulated, and many knowledgeable observers would regard it as dysfunctional. Yet even a random collection of actions constitute a policy, so let me offer my own interpretation of where we are.</p><p>The essential core of the Trump Middle East policy is the alliance with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The effort to bring the two Arab states into close association with Israel was the most innovative element of this policy, as was the blatantly transactional nature of the relationship with the two wealthy Arab states. President Trump defined it quite simply as “Just take the money.”</p><p>My understanding of the importance of this alliance was to promote and sustain the Deal of the Century, which was to resolve the Israel-Palestinian dispute once and for all. Israel was obviously an essential player in this process, but Arab cover and money was required to lend the process legitimacy and agency.</p><p>The one common interest that tied these parties together was fear and hatred of Iran. None of the Middle East countries could deal with Iran by itself. But the United States could take the lead in weakening and deterring Iran, and perhaps even fomenting regime change in Tehran.</p><p>So together, Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mohammad bin Salman (MbS, crown prince and effective ruler of Saudi Arabia), and Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ, crown prince of Abu Dhabi and effective ruler of the UAE) were going to restructure the landscape of the Middle East.</p><p>Reality, of course, intruded – by Gary Sick</p><p><span><a href="https://lobelog.com/the-wheels-are-coming-off/">https://lobelog.com/the-wheels-are-coming-off/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>David Rosen: “Trump and Company May Instigate a War with Iran to Strengthen His Reelection Chances”</p><p>What is your analysis of recent events between the Trump administration and Iran?</p><p>Trump – or, better, Bolton -- needs an enemy and Iran is the perfect fool’s foil. Bolton has sought to overthrow Iran’s post-Shah government for 25 years and finally has a president/administration that will play his game. They are pushing the “great squeeze” to punish ordinary Iranians and to see if this suffering can provoke a military incident. If that strategy doesn’t work, one can well expect that the CIA, Israel or Saudi operatives to instigate a “false flag” incident and claim that Iranian forces attacked U.S. interests. However, Trump seems resistant to starting a military initiative that can’t be contained or the outcome unpredictable. I don’t think he and some within his team want another Afghanistan-Iraq war that goes on and on.</p><p>Do not you think Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal was a serious mistake?</p><p>“Serious mistake” for whom? In terms of international nuclear arms control, it was a mistake, helping to further destabilize the Middle East. However, for Trump – and Israel and the Saudi (Sunni) monarchy – it was a smart move that furthers their campaign to overthrow the Iranian (Shi’a) government.</p><p>In your opinion, is not the influence of Bolton and the neocons on the Trump administration dangerous for world peace?</p><p>Bolton is an old-fashion, non-repentant anti-communist in a world where old-fashioned communism has all but disappeared, only holding on in Cuba. He would have fit in with the good-old McCarthy/HUAC ranters but those days are over. So, he picks new enemies -- be they Iran, Cuba, Venezuela or N. Korea – and reinvents the cold war, claiming these suffering countries are actual threats to U.S. imperial hegemony.

It remains to be seen whether he would try to escalate our government’s already illegal involvement in this war. To date, Trump has indulged the Saudi government on practically everything, and he has been echoing Saudi propaganda on Yemen for so many years that he may actually think that this has something to do with fighting Iran.
