Instead, its conflict has turned into a struggle between regional powers. It appears that the Saudi-led coalition that launched military operations against Ansar Allah, otherwise referred to as the Houthis, to back up the internationally recognized government of Abed Rabbuh Mansur Hadi is no longer fully wedded to its initial goal.</p><p><span><a href="https://carnegie-mec.org/2020/03/09/yemen-and-geo-political-implications-of-regional-involvement-event-7289">https://carnegie-mec.org/2020/03/09/yemen-and-geo-political-implications-of-regional-involvement-event-7289</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1 Am wichtigsten / Most important</span></h2><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Huthi-Rebellen im Jemen blockieren Hilfe für Millionen Menschen</strong></p><p><span>Hunger, Unterernährung, Vertreibung: Millionen Menschen im vom Krieg zerrissenen Jemen sind bitter auf internationale Hilfe angewiesen. Aber viele der Lieferungen werden von den Huthi-Rebellen blockiert, für eigene Zwecke. Die notleidenden Einwohner zahlen die Zeche.</span></p><p><span>Die Menschen im Bezirk Aslam im Jemen litten so sehr Hunger, dass sie sich von gekochten Blättern ernährten. Aber es war Hilfe in Sicht: eine Lieferung von 2000 Tonnen an Nahrungsmitteln aus internationalen Programmen — genug, um 160'000 Menschen zu versorgen. Das Essen kam aber nie bei den Notleidenden an. Die Huthi-Rebellen blockierten die Verteilung der Mittel, stellten Forderungen — und als sie dann endlich grünes Licht gaben, war die Nahrung völlig verdorben, wie ein UN-Mitarbeiter schilderte.</span></p><p><span>Dieses Vorgehen der Huthis ist alles andere als ein Einzelfall. Die Rebellen <a href="https://www.bluewin.ch/de/news/international/krieg-wirft-jemen-jahrzehnte-zurueck-253608.html">in dem vom Krieg zerrissenen Land</a> haben die Hälfte der UN-Hilfslieferungen blockiert — eine Taktik, um die Weltorganisation zu zwingen, ihnen grössere Kontrolle über die massive humanitäre Operation und einen direkten Anteil an den Hilfsgeldern zu geben. Das geht aus Schilderungen von UN-Vertretern und Dutzenden internen Dokumenten hervor, die der Nachrichtenagentur AP vorliegen.</span></p><p><span>Demnach hat die Rebellengruppe den Zugang zu von ihnen kontrollierten Gebieten von einer Reihe von Bedingungen abhängig gemacht, die von den UN und internationalen Geldgebern abgelehnt werden — zum Teil deshalb, weil das den Huthis einen grösseren Einfluss darauf geben würde, wer die Hilfe erhält.</span></p><p>Von der Behinderung von Nahrungsmittellieferungen und Programmen zur Hilfe für Vertriebene seien mehr als zwei Millionen Menschen «direkt betroffen», schildert ein UN-Beamter. Die Weltorganisation hat in der Öffentlichkeit zwar weitgehend über den Druck geschwiegen, sich aber hinter den Kulissen dagegen gestemmt.</p><p>So haben die Rebellen etwa Monate lang verlangt, dass zwei Prozent des gesamten Budgets für Hilfsmassnahmen direkt ihnen zufliessen, was die UN und Geldgeber ablehnten. Die Versuche, «eine Steuer auf humanitäre Unterstützung zu erheben, sind unakzeptabel und widersprechen internationalen humanitären Prinzipien», betonte ein Sprecher der US-Behörde für Internationale Entwicklung in einer E-Mail an AP.</p><p><span>Behörden und Geldgeber drohen mit Lieferstopp</span></p><p><span>Die Huthis sind in der vergangenen Woche anscheinend von ihrer Zwei-Prozent-Forderung abgerückt, aber versuchen Helfern zufolge weiter, andere Bedingungen durchzusetzen.</span></p><p><span>Für die Hilfen zuständige Behörden und internationale Geldgeber drohen nun damit, die humanitären Massnahmen zu reduzieren, wenn die Huthis die Behinderungen fortsetzten. Die Situation habe «die Grenze der Belastbarkeit» erreicht, hiess es in einer gemeinsamen Erklärung, die in der vergangenen Woche bei einem Treffen in Brüssel veröffentlicht wurde.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.bluewin.ch/de/news/international/huthi-rebellen-im-jemen-blockieren-hilfe-fuer-millionen-menschen-359989.html">https://www.bluewin.ch/de/news/international/huthi-rebellen-im-jemen-blockieren-hilfe-fuer-millionen-menschen-359989.html</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>UN: Houthi rebels impeding aid flow in Yemen</strong></p><p>Yemen’s Houthi rebels have blocked half of the United Nations’ aid delivery programs in the war-torn country — a strong-arm tactic to force the agency to give them greater control over the massive humanitarian campaign, along with a cut of billions of dollars in foreign assistance, according to aid officials and internal documents obtained by The Associated Press.</p><p>The rebel group has made granting access to areas under their control contingent on a flurry of conditions that aid agencies reject, in part because it would give the Houthis greater sway over who receives aid, documents and interviews show.</p><p>The Houthis’ obstruction has hindered several programs that feed the near-starving population and help those displaced by the nearly 6-year civil war, a senior U.N. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the situation.</p><p>“Over 2 million beneficiaries ... are directly affected,” the official said.</p><p>The Houthis have been pushing back against U.N. efforts to tighten monitoring of some $370 million a year that its agencies already give to government institutions controlled mostly by the rebel group, documents show. That money is supposed to pay salaries and other administration costs, but more than a third of the money spent last year wasn’t audited, according to an internal document leaked to the AP.</p><p>The U.N. has largely kept quiet in public about the pressure, but behind the scenes the agency and international donors are digging in against the Houthi demands. The AP spoke to seven workers and officials from U.N. and independent agencies about the situation. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. The AP also saw dozens of documents, including emails of aid officials.</p><p>In October, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Lise Grande, sent a letter to the Houthi-appointed prime minister complaining about a long list of demands.</p><p>The “overwhelming majority” of them impede or delay delivery of aid and many violate humanitarian principles, she said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by the AP.</p><p>For months, the Houthis demanded a 2% cut from the entire aid budget be given to them, a condition the U.N. and donors rejected. </p><p>Last week, the Houthis appeared to back off the 2% demand, but continue to press for other concessions, according to aid officials.</p><p>During a meeting in Brussels last Thursday, aid agencies and international donors threatened to reduce aid if Houthis continue to impose restrictions on U.N. operations in Yemen.</p><p>The situation “has reached a breaking point,” they said in a statement.</p><p>At least one agency, the World Food Program, is currently considering cutting back the monthly food aid it delivers to 12 million Yemenis every other month, a U.N. official said. ”It’s unfortunate that people will suffer but this is on the Houthis,” the official said. “They can’t use people as hostages for too long.”</p><p>The Houthis’ demands have stoked longtime concerns among aid agencies over the rebels’ diverting of humanitarian funds and supplies into their own or their supporters’ pockets or toward their war effort.</p><p>The Houthi have withheld visas and permissions for equipment and supplies and refused to grant clearances for U.N. missions to move through rebel-controlled areas. Aid workers said agency leaders’ past willingness to concede to some of the rebels’ demands has emboldened the Houthi leaders to push for more.</p><p>Nearly 300,000 pregnant and nursing mothers and children under age 5 haven’t received nutrition supplements for more than six months because the Houthis “held beneficiaries hostage to the 2%” demand, another U.N. official said.</p><p>In another example, Houthi authorities for months delayed permission to distribute 2,000 tons of food — enough to feed 160,000 people — in the district of Aslam, where the AP previously found starving villagers reduced to eating boiled leaves. When approval came in November, the food had spoiled “beyond the point of salvage,” another aid official said.</p><p>Houthi leaders have remained defiant in the face of U.N. pushback – by Maggie Michael</p><p><span><a href="https://apnews.com/edb2cad767ccbf898c220e54c199b6d9">https://apnews.com/edb2cad767ccbf898c220e54c199b6d9</a></span> = <span><a href="https://apnews.com/edb2cad767ccbf898c220e54c199b6d9">https://apnews.com/edb2cad767ccbf898c220e54c199b6d9</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>'Too late for thousands': Yemen mercy flights present little relief for country's sick</strong></p><p>Flights to Jordan to treat patients have been hailed as a 'diplomatic breakthrough' - but their capacity is too small for the scope of the crisis in Yemen</p><p>The move has been heralded as a positive step in the agonisingly slow peace negotiations between Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition - but with a further 29 million people caught amid the five-year war and unable to leave the country, these handful of people are just a drop in the ocean.</p><p>Yemen’s healthcare system was already fragile prior to war, however the conflict that has decimated the country for the last five years has left less than 50 percent of hospitals and medical facilities fully or partially operational. </p><p>Public sector employees, including healthcare workers, have not been paid salaries in several years and rely on incentives paid by the World Health Organisation (WHO). </p><p>Meanwhile, conditions such as cancer, kidney disease as well as others are now killing more people than the war due to limited treatment options available inside the country. </p><p>Another patient to have been flown in on the mercy flights is 43-year-old Daulah, who did not give her surname. </p><p>She has thyroid cancer but has no idea how serious her condition is because of the lack of medical equipment in Yemen. </p><p>Following the cancelled flights in October, WHO thought it best to keep the patients in Sanaa in case flights once again became possible. </p><p>Daulah and her husband ended up living in a hotel away from their children for four months. </p><p>“I’ve cried a lot because it’s hard to be away from my children," she tells MEE.</p><p>"My youngest is 10 years old. They could visit but they were too far away and weren’t able to get to the hotel. </p><p>"My husband convinced me to stay. Once we were in the air I was overwhelmed with happiness. </p><p>"Now I just want to get better so that I can get back to my children.”</p><p>'Diplomatic breakthrough'</p><p>In a statement in response to news of the mercy flights, the Norwegian Refugee Council's Yemen country director Mohammed Abdi said the agreement “comes too late for thousands of Yemenis who died waiting to leave the country for urgent life-saving care”. </p><p>The warring sides “need to end their political wrangling and fully reopen Sanaa airport for commercial flights”, he added.</p><p>Sultana Begum, the NRC advocacy manager in Yemen, called the move a “diplomatic breakthrough”, but stressed that it was a tiny step.</p><p>“According to government figures up to 32,000 people have died in the last three years while waiting for specialised treatment, although that’s not a figure we’re able to verify,” she told MEE, adding the NRC’s biggest focus is opening Sanaa’s airport to commercial flights once more.</p><p>Begum highlighted the length of time negotiations concerning the mercy flights have taken – discussions having first begun in October 2018. </p><p>“There was a really positive change last year, which created the space needed for an agreement about these mercy flights," said Begum.</p><p>"The Saudi-led coalition gave the go-ahead as a goodwill gesture and to indicate some kind of progress.”</p><p>'Narrow window of opportunity'</p><p>An agreement was also made to allow humanitarian aid into Taiz governorate.</p><p>“But while getting bogged down with making the Stockholm agreement work, more violence has erupted in other parts of the country,” said Begum.</p><p>“There is a narrow window of opportunity to have a nationwide ceasefire and start political talks but we’re really concerned this escalating violence will be damaging to the constructive talks that have already taken place.”</p><p>Elisabeth Kendall, a senior research fellow at Oxford University, said allowing 29 people to receive medical care they otherwise would not was of course welcome, but added that to consider the move as anything substantial in bringing the conflict to the end was “delusional”.</p><p>“It needs to be multiplied by 1,000 to make any difference," Kendall told MEE.</p><p>"The fighting is getting worse and that’s why the United Nations and everyone else clings to positivity, which is understandable after five years of efforts and very little to show for them.</p><p>“But the fact it has taken so long shows just how difficult it is to get these sides aligned on something as obvious and uncontroversial as allowing sick children to receive treatment.</p><p>"We need Sanaa airport to be fully open,” she said.</p><p>The hope is for a ceasefire, Kendall added, but pointed out that even if confidence-building exercises between the Houthis and the coalition delivered in the form of the mercy flights were successful, there remained a myriad of warring parties to be taken into consideration. </p><p>“There are huge power struggles simmering beneath the surface,” she said – by Charlie Faulkner</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/too-late-thousands-yemen-mercy-flights-present-little-relief-for-country-sick">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/too-late-thousands-yemen-mercy-flights-present-little-relief-for-country-sick</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>How Houthi forces won key Yemeni district</strong></p><p>After five years of advance and retreat, Yemen's Houthi rebels <span><a href="https://www.annahar.com/article/1111474-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%85-%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%AB-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7">captured</a></span> the country's critical Nahm district, east of the capital, Sanaa. Their victory forced national army forces — supported by a Saudi-led Arab coalition — to retreat to Marib province.</p><p>Some observers, however, believe the Houthis' success might have been due at least in part to Saudi Arabia putting its own interests ahead of winning the battle.</p><p>The <span><a href="http://twitter.com/army21ye/status/1223602026581499905">operation</a></span> succeeded Jan. 26 after less than a week, taking over nearly 2,000 square kilometers (1,243 square miles) mostly consisting of mountains and rugged terrain. This means that any force's attempt to return to the land will require time, effort, money and sacrifice.</p><p>By capturing Nahm, the eastern gateway to Sanaa, the forces of the Houthi <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200127-yemens-houthis-make-biggest-gains-against-hadi-forces/">National Salvation Government</a></span> secured all paths leading to the capital. During this recent battle, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, described Nahm <span><a href="http://twitter.com/Moh_Alhouthi/status/1220633950827241472">on Twitter</a></span> as “the most important front in the Sanaa governate."</p><p>With the fall of the Nahm front, stretching more than 35 kilometers (21 miles), the Houthis warded off a major threat they have faced since the war began in March 2015.</p><p>Moreover, the Houthis — officially known as Ansar Allah — now control the chain of highlands overlooking the provinces of al-Jawf and Marib, most notably a strategic rim of the Yam Mountains and the camp of Hadi's 312th Armored Brigade. This position gives them an advantage in monitoring and controlling fire lines along these areas.</p><p>The recent fall of Nahm was linked to the Houthis' ability to take advantage of several local and regional developments, most notably the period of calm between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis. <span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/11/yemen-saudi-arabia-talks-houthis-war-peace.html">Talks</a></span> between the two parties have been held in Oman since November.</p><p>Abdel Bari Taher, former head of the Yemeni Journalists Syndicate, told Al-Monitor the situation in Nahm is clearly linked to the dispute between the UAE-backed <span><a href="https://stc-eu.org/en/?fbclid=IwAR1Vb7Oae4O3tl_XnLeI0LrVkl5WcZCK76crlveopDhOcE-B32WLLJQR_Ww">STC</a></span> and Hadi's government over the execution of the Riyadh Agreement. This offered Houthis an opportunity to exploit the recent developments.</p><p>Former Yemeni Ambassador to Syria <span><a href="https://twitter.com/Abd_Tawwaf?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Abdul Wahab Tawaf</a></span> agreed with Taher's assessment.</p><p>“What happened in Nahm is the result of the [UN-backed] government’s attempt to cleanse Aden and Shabwa of the Emirati-backed [STC's] militia. This confirms that Abu Dhabi is <span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/11/yemen-aden-uae-withdrawal-saudi-hadi-dispute.html">continuing to support</a></span> the secession of Southern Yemen from its north," Tawaf told Al-Monitor.</p><p>“The lack of quality weapons and Patriot [missiles] enabled the Houthi militia to bomb civilians in Marib and the camps,” he said.</p><p>For his part, Abdul Ghani al-Zubeidi, an expert in political and military affairs close to the Houthis, revealed that Qatar had mediated after the battle for Nahm, to keep Houthis from advancing toward Marib province. He attributed the fall of Nahm to the division between Hadi’s forces and those of al-Islah political party (Yemen’s Muslim Brotherhood).</p><p>The journalist Taher said there is no doubt the Arab coalition is trying to weaken all Yemeni parties. At every stage of the conflict, it has sought to rearrange the situation politically and militarily through settlements among its allies and by repositioning these allies to perpetuate the cycle of advances and retreats.</p><p>The course of events since the coalition’s intervention has proven that it is mainly seeking to secure Saudi borders and its strategic interests in Yemen – by Ammar al-Ashwal</p><p><span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/02/yemen-nahm-district-houthis-uae-saudi-arabia-legitimate-gvt.html">https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/02/yemen-nahm-district-houthis-uae-saudi-arabia-legitimate-gvt.html</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Mahra, Yemen: A Shadow Conflict Worth Watching</strong></p><p>But while Mahra is not a hotbed of the Houthi conflict, intensive military deployment suggests that a shadow conflict has emerged and regional powers are now heavily invested in the region.</p><p>Recruited and financed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), local Hadrami elite forces control the territories along the coast of the Hadramout Governate leading to Mahra. Saudi-backed security forces moved into Mahra in 2017 and now dominate its nine districts; their numbers continue to strengthen, and they have recently built several new military compounds. Oman has no formal military presence in Mahra, but it indirectly supports local tribes standing against the Saudis.</p><p>In the heart of Mahra’s capital, Ghayda, a small area with bleachers originally designed for official celebrations is now frequently used for protests attracting hundreds and sometimes thousands of people. In September 2019, Mahri protest leaders—backed by Oman—formed the Southern National Salvation Council to counter the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council and expel the Saudi-led coalition’s military forces from both Mahra and South Yemen. The leaders are demanding that the Saudis hand over control of Mahra’s airport, key ports, and administrative and community institutions.</p><p>Not all Mahris are resisting the regional powers’ increased presence, however; thousands have been recruited by military forces to secure their loyalty. Unfortunately, this is leading to internal divisions among tribes who have historically maintained their independent identity within Yemen and shared common social, linguistic, and cultural characteristics.</p><p>A Burgeoning Economy, but Who Is in Control?</p><p>Who will ultimately benefit the most from Mahra’s growth is not easy to predict. Regional powers in Mahra are jostling for influence over local Yemeni tribes who have distanced themselves from the wider conflict but have suffered from a weak national government. Each power has so far been largely successful in furthering their interests.</p><p>The Saudis’ main goal is to keep the Houthis out of eastern Yemen. But their expanding economic interests in Mahra have pitted them against the UAE, which wishes to protect its commercial shipping lines on the south coast. Oman, once a more neutral actor, has stepped up its indirect support of Yemenis—money, cars, media coverage, and diplomatic connections—to secure its border. How long the relative peace can last in this environment is uncertain.</p><p>New and old Mahra residents are seizing opportunities as a result of this competition. But they are also struggling to find their way in an increasingly corrupt and restrictive environment.</p><p>Over the last several years, Mahra’s local government has weakened significantly. For example, in 2017, former governor Mohammed Kudda began to organize the first-ever annual conference to promote investment opportunities in Mahra. Yemeni businesspeople, especially diaspora living in Egypt, Jordan, and the Horn of Africa, showed an immediate interest. But then, at the Saudis’ request, President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi dismissed the governor, who had been critical of Saudi interventions in the governate. Hadi installed a Saudi-loyal replacement, Rajih Bakrit, whose first decision was to cancel the conference.</p><p>Mahra’s local authorities have since largely adopted Saudi policies, including higher tariffs on customs and the banning of close to 100 goods from entering the governate (the Saudis claim the Houthis may use them to manufacture weapons).</p><p>The Saudis are not the only ones filling the administrative vacuum. While traveling around the city, it’s hard to miss the many billboards carrying the names of development projects. Most are financed by the Saudi-King Salman Center and the UAE Red Crescent and Oman-Charitable organizations. While they are formally listed as humanitarian institutions in Yemen, they are tied to the countries’ respective governments and therefore come with political and economic strings attached. The Red Crescent is run by military officers.</p><p>These organizations have built much-needed schools, medical centers, roads, and wells. But according to a local activist, the motivation behind their projects is not the area’s development but rather the expansion of their influence. Many projects that are announced do not move forward.</p><p>Stability Is Bought</p><p>Aside from appearing to meet Mahris’ basic needs, regional powers are using another, more direct way to bolster their influence. According to armed tribesmen I interviewed, over the last two years, Saudi-backed forces have recruited around 6,000 Mahris to gain their loyalty.</p><p>Recruits are largely enticed by healthy salaries.</p><p>The armed tribesmen also receive salaries from their tribal leaders, many of whom are backed by Oman and want to assure some degree of loyalty to the tribe. This shows how much Yemenis’ livelihoods are dependent on the continuing conflict.</p><p>The Coast Increasingly Belongs to the Military</p><p>For others in Mahra, however, making a living is still a struggle.</p><p>fishermen face tightening restrictions. Fishing is now prohibited in areas close to Saudi military installations, which continue to spread along the coast. This forces fishermen into more remote areas, including the Somali Sea. Although the Mahri community and some Somalian tribes have close social and economic relations, fishing in the area is dangerous. Navy fleets have mistaken Mahri anglers for pirates.</p><p>Saudi forces also restrict shipping access in the ports and require prior approval before arrival. Once docked, they often board the boats to check for banned items, including solar electricity systems, batteries, and fertilizers.</p><p>The situation has apparently worsened since the Saudis deployed forces to Nishtun Port in September 2018. They claim to be combating smuggling networks across the Yemen-Oman border, especially those related to the Houthi movement. But even Mahra’s Saudi-backed governor <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjR78lAcQ-Q">stated</a></span> that, since November 2017, no smuggling network has been caught by Saudi forces.</p><p>Instead, the Saudis are likely preparing to renew plans for a massive oil pipeline that would bypass the Iranian-controlled Strait of Hormuz and run from Mahra’s coast to Saudi Arabia’s Kharakhir coast—a move that would boost security and greatly reduce transportation costs. Evidence of their intentions have included a <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/08/saudi-arabia-build-oil-port-yemen-al-mahra-sources-180820082111526.html">leaked document</a></span> from a marine construction company to a Saudi official and a <span><a href="https://arabic.rt.com/news/819796-%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC-%D8%A8%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8/">report</a></span> that engineering teams have been studying the mechanics of the project.</p><p>Smugglers Are Free to Go About Their Business</p><p>Yet smuggling routes going up the coast are a major problem. Through Mahra, networks smuggle cars from Oman to Yemen and qat and handguns from Yemen to Oman. </p><p>The Spoils of Legitimate Trade Are Being Siphoned</p><p>Despite the smuggling, however, customs revenues have ballooned since 2015, currently bringing in $3 to $4 million monthly according to managers at Shihen crossing. At the center of the Oman-Yemen border, the crossing has grown to be one of the busiest land ports in Yemen.</p><p>Unfortunately, Saudi-backed local authorities control the crossing and refuse to send the requisite customs revenues to the Central Bank in Aden. The money instead goes toward buying the local tribes’ loyalty. Meanwhile, public institutions in Mahra are still suffering from a financial deficit – by Ahmed Nagi (with photos)</p><p><span><a href="https://carnegie-mec.org/2020/02/20/mahra-yemen-shadow-conflict-worth-watching-pub-80986">https://carnegie-mec.org/2020/02/20/mahra-yemen-shadow-conflict-worth-watching-pub-80986</a></span></p><p><span>My remark: More on Mahrah below in cp6.</span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Extremism and the Islah Party in Yemen</strong></p><p>The Gathering for Yemeni Reform (<em>Al-Tajamu al-Yemeni al-Islah</em>), generally known simply as Al-Islah, is a political party founded in Yemen shortly after unification in 1990. Al-Islah has long denied, and with especial vehemence since 2013, any affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood. However, the known facts point to a long, if at times complex, history of association between Al-Islah and the Brotherhood — and other extremist groups. As such, Al-Islah has been a risk factor in Yemen’s search for stability for many decades.</p><p>The Muslim Brotherhood first emerged in Yemen in the 1960s and 1970s, when Abdul Majeed al-Zindani led a group of clerics to establish a religious education system in northern Yemen. These schools were emulating the system of religious schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Yemeni version aimed at countering the wave of secularism coming from the Soviet-dependent socialist regime in South Yemen.</p><p>Al-Zindani is one of the founders and leaders of the Islah party, and is among the most visible links between that party and religious terrorist groups. Al-Zindani was <span><a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/js1190.aspx">declared a terrorist in the year 2004</a></span> by the United States Department of Treasury. According to the Treasury, there was reliable evidence at that time that Al-Zindani “support[ed] designated terrorists and terrorist organizations”.</p><p>Al-Zindani had a “long history of working with [Osama] bin Laden, notably serving as one of his spiritual leaders”, the Treasury designation went on, adding that he had been an active recruiter for Al-Qaeda training camps and played a “key role” in purchasing weapons on behalf of Al-Qaeda and other jihadi terrorists.</p><p>Probably the best-known terrorist incident Al-Zindani, and by extension Al-Islah, was tied to was the October 2000 bombing of the American destroyer, the USS <em>Cole</em>, off the coast of Aden, which killed 17 American sailors in 2000.</p><p>In the early nineties, Al-Zindani established Al-Iman University in Sanaa. A number of students from this University were suspected of, or arrested for, terrorist activities, as the Treasury designation of Al-Zindani mentions.</p><p>The history of the conflict in Yemen suggests that when considering Sunni Islamist militancy, the Islah party, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the “harder” jihadist organizations like Al-Qaeda are not so easily separated; the ideas and even the members are fluid, switching between one or other and back again according to the imperatives of time and place.</p><p>Perhaps the setbacks suffered by Islamist terrorist organizations in Yemen over the years — from the U.S. drone strikes, the gradual <span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/death-of-aqap-leader-shows-the-groups-fragmentationand-durability">erosion of the cohesion</a></span> of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and the <span><a href="https://eeradicalization.com/the-evolution-of-counterterrorism-in-yemen/">blows dealt by the Gulf coalition</a></span> to terrorism since 2015 — will have diminished the appeal and impact of extremist ideas. But there are reasons for pessimism. These ideas were cultivated by an effective proselytizing campaign from northern Yemen since the sixties. The mitigation, let alone removal, of these ideas is likely to require a generation and more of work — and that would be in the best of circumstances. The ongoing war and the sectarian aggression of Iran and its Houthi proxies provides an environment Sunni Islamists thrive in.</p><p><span><a href="https://eeradicalization.com/extremism-and-the-islah-party-in-yemen/">https://eeradicalization.com/extremism-and-the-islah-party-in-yemen/</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2><p>(* B H)</p><p>Cholera situation in Yemen, January 2020</p><p>In January 2020, the Ministry of Public Health and Population of Yemen reported a total 35 512 suspected cholera cases including 13 related deaths (case fatality rate: 0.04%) from 22 governorates.</p><p>The cumulative number of suspected cholera cases reported in Yemen from October 2016 to January 2020 is 2 316 197 including 3910 related deaths with a case fatality rate of 0.17%.

The ambush took place along a road recently constructed to facilitate the Saudi coalition’s push from Majaza (orange) to Saada governorate’s Baqim district (green). The Houthi sniper team employed an Iranian AM-50 Sayyad Sniper Rifle in the ambush. This article will describe how to geolocate this kinetic event in the Majaza battlefront. Houthi media, mapping platforms, and publicly available information about Saudi infrastructure projects indicate Majaza (orange) is based in the Saudi region of Asir (blue).</p><p><span>Geolocating the Houthi sniper team’s physical environment revealed that they were actually based in Baqim, Saada, a Yemeni governorate — not in Saudi Arabia as they had claimed. They may have been employing operational security or were referring to the cross-border frontlines.</span></p><p><span>Verifying cross-border clashes is further complicated by the Saudi coalition and Houthis’ usual silence on events that negatively portray their military forces.</span></p><p>Within this confusing information environment, it is important to discuss the significance of a Houthi sniper team’s use of an Iranian AM-50 sniper rifle.</p><p>Arms tracking websites such as <span><a href="http://spioenkop.blogspot.com/2019/09/list-of-iranian-arms-and-equipment.html">Oryx</a></span>, <span><a href="https://armamentresearch.com/iranian-am50-anti-materiel-rifle-documented-in-yemen/">Armament Research Services</a></span>, and <span><a href="https://www.conflictarm.com/dispatches/maritime-interdictions-of-weapon-supplies-to-somalia-and-yemen/">Conflict Armament Research</a></span> have posted numbers, photos, and reports about Iranian sniper rifles either heading to or being present in Houthi areas.</p><p><span>It is difficult to prove that the Houthis are employing these rifles in actual battlefield operations in Yemen.

Bill Urban, the chief spokesman for U.S. Central Command. The supply included some 150 “Dehlavieh” anti-tank guided missiles, land-attack and anti-ship cruise missiles, and newly designed Iranian surface-to-air missiles known as “358s,” he said. It also included drone parts, thermal weapons scopes and other advanced weapons parts.</p><p>“The United States assesses with high confidence that the weapons seized by the USS Forrest Sherman in November and the weapons seized by the USS Normandy in February were manufactured in Iran and were being illicitly smuggled to the Houthis in Yemen,” Urban told reporters Wednesday at the Pentagon. “There is no doubt to where these weapons came from or where they were going.”</p><p>Urban cited markings on the weapons in English and Farsi languages that he said were unique to Iranian weaponry. Some of the parts of the cruise missiles matched weaponry used in attacks conducted by Iran and its proxy organizations, including the September attack on Saudi oil facilities by drones and cruise missiles, he said.</p><p>The Navy captain also said he hoped highlighting the continued illicit supply of Iranian weapons to the Houthis would galvanize the international community to take notice, and perhaps take action against Tehran.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/centcom-weapons-shipment-from-iran-seized-in-arabian-sea-was-on-the-way-to-houthi-rebels-in-yemen-1.619374">https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/centcom-weapons-shipment-from-iran-seized-in-arabian-sea-was-on-the-way-to-houthi-rebels-in-yemen-1.619374</a></span></p><p>and</p><p>(* A K P)</p><p>Ship seizures included ‘relatively new’ Iranian surface to air missile bound for Houthi rebels in Yemen</p><p>U.S. military officials said Wednesday that the seizures of weapons by two U.S. Navy <span><a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/12/04/officials-warship-seizes-iranian-missile-components/">warships</a></span> in the Arabian Sea in November and February included newly designed Iranian surface-to-air missiles among other weaponry bound for Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p><p>Capt.

He said the shipments of the advanced weaponry fit a pattern carried out by Iran.</p><p>Urban said there have been six ship interdictions by American warships in the CENTCOM area of responsibility over the last five years involving illicit smuggling of arms to Iranian proxies in the region. Two of the ship boardings have occurred within the last four months.</p><p>Urban told reporters that the recent seizures were not necessarily a sign of an uptick in Iranian operations to supply proxy militias across the region.</p><p>He said that ship interdictions in the CENTCOM are a relatively “difficult process” that sometimes involves luck due to the vastness of the sea and the relatively small ships smuggling illicit arms.</p><p>Urban said Iran was behind the illicit smuggling of the advanced weaponry bound for Houthis in Yemen.

An oil storage vessel called the FSO Safer has been sitting more or less unattended in the Red Sea for half a decade.</p><p>A victim of Yemen’s current civil war, the Safer has fallen in to a dire state of disrepair, with rust spreading around her hull and on-board equipment. She is packed with more than a million barrels of crude oil, which over time is thought to have steadily released flammable gases meaning the Safer could explode if she doesn’t simply begin leaking huge volumes of oil into the sea.</p><p>That would cause a huge environmental catastrophe – one that would affect the lives of millions of people in the region. How did this ship end up in such a sorry state?</p><p>When war broke out in Yemen in March 2015, few people gave the vessel much thought. It and many other assets owned by the same firm were quickly seized by Houthi rebels. But unlike land-based installations and pipelines, the Safer now finds itself in an especially precarious predicament. Sitting in the sea, it is corroding away rapidly as we speak.</p><p>The conflict in Yemen has proved to be both long and complicated, <span><a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/north-africa-west-asia/yemens-hopes-and-expectations-part-1-the-stockholm-agreement/">with no end in sight</a></span>. The internationally-recognised government in the country, which is currently supported by Saudi Arabia, has no access to the Safer because the vessel remains under Houthi control. Analysts say the Houthis are using the Safer as leverage.</p><p>In the absence of constant sanding and painting of the hull, the Safer has essentially been left to rot. And while Prof Khalili notes that tankers caught in the midst of past conflicts in the region have been known to leak oil before, the volume of crude on the Safer puts it into a league of its own.</p><p>“That makes it a lot more of a concern,” she says.</p><p>“It will not be the kind of spill that will settle on the bottom or simply on the top,” Dr Soud says.</p><p>That means the Safer presents a significant threat to nearby coral reefs, marine life and also desalination plants in the region that provide drinking water to nearby countries including Saudi Arabia.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/yemens-deadly-ghost-ship/">https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/yemens-deadly-ghost-ship/</a></span></p><p>My comment: This article is biased as it only blames the Houthis.

This viewpoint was traded widely on WhatsApp and reported by Al Jazeera. Other locals suggested the protestors themselves had sparked the confrontation.</p><p>The context for the incident dates back to late 2017, when Saudi Arabia deployed forces to al-Mahra for anti-smuggling operations, citing concerns that the Houthis were obtaining advanced Iranian missile parts and other weaponry from over the border. Omani officials have denied that such smuggling occurs.</p><p>Led by Gen. Ali Salem al-Hurayzi, the Yemeni commander formerly in charge of local border operations, the Mahri protest group argues that Saudi force levels are well beyond what is necessary for anti-smuggling operations. In their view, the dominant Saudi presence encroaches on their way of life and may be a prelude to Riyadh building an oil pipeline through the province. Indeed, the kingdom has asked Yemen and Oman for access to the open seas in past decades, and Mahri protestors believe that this remains the Saudi goal, pointing to leaked documents and reports of engineering activity in 2018 as indications.</p><p>The last major flare-up between Saudi forces and Mahri protestors occurred in May 2019. That flame went out in a few days, and the same may happen this time—indeed, some Mahris are not aligned with Hurayzi despite their frustration with the Saudi presence. Yet rumors that the Saudis are bringing in Yemeni forces from other provinces to aid them, if true, could exacerbate anti-Saudi sentiment and bolster Hurayzi’s position.</p><p>As such, the situation has the potential to create a conflict between American partners in the region, whether now or down the road. Both Saudi Arabia and Oman may see such a conflict in existential terms: for Riyadh, alleged smuggling over the Omani border equips the Houthis with missiles that they have repeatedly fired into Saudi territory; for Muscat, having a Saudi military force sitting on its border during a fragile leadership transition is disquieting. Neither government wants a conflict, but neither is likely to back down from protecting its interests.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/challenges-await-omans-new-sultan-as-mourning-period-ends">https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/challenges-await-omans-new-sultan-as-mourning-period-ends</a></span></p><p><span>My remark: More on this conflict in the reports below and in cp1.</span></p><p>and</p><p>(* B P)</p><p>Conflicting narratives emerge over clashes between Saudi military, tribal gunmen on Yemen-Oman border</p><p>Armed clashes broke out between Saudi forces and tribal gunmen near Shehn land port linking Yemen and Oman on Monday evening, as the groups compete for influence in Al-Mahra governorate in eastern Yemen. </p><p>The clashes, which involved an Apache helicopter in support of the Saudi military convoy, lasted for several hours. </p><p>Conflicting narratives have emerged about other details of the fighting.</p><p>Al-Mahra’s local authority accused the tribal gunmen of an armed ambush on the Saudi forces, which are stationed in the area under the pretext of supporting internationally recognized government forces combatting smuggling there. The Saudi forces were carrying out a routine inspection of the Shehn border crossing’s electronic inspection device and assessing the security situation at the land port, according to the local authority’s Al-Mahra Information Center. </p><p>An official on the organizing committee of the peaceful sit-in of the people of Al-Mahra, an Oman-backed group opposing the Saudi military presence in Yemen's easternmost governorate, said the clashes started because the Saudi forces were obstructing the movement of locals through the port. The official told Almasdar Online that the Saudi forces, accompanied by the Mahra local authority, opened fire first, and that triggered the tribesmen to cut off troop reinforcements heading to the port.</p><p>The committee called the Saudi attacks on the tribesmen and citizens of the Fujit area of Shehn district “criminal.” </p><p>A statement from the committee, a copy of which was viewed by Almasdar Online, described the Saudi forces’ actions at the port as an attempt to restrict the movement of citizens and treat the port as their military base. The sit-in group also called on all parties to resist the Saudi occupation and expel it, emphasizing dialogue between Yemenis without outside interference, and called on the Yemeni government to step up its responsibilities. </p><p><span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/375">https://al-masdaronline.net/national/375</a></span></p><p>and</p><p>(* A K P)</p><p>Broad Discontent Calling for Expulsion of the Saudi Occupation from Al-Mahrah Governorate</p><p>Voices of condemnation, denouncing the attacks of the Saudi occupation forces on the sons of Al-Mahrah tribes in the Shahan port, demanded Riyadh to withdraw all its forces from the province as soon as possible.</p><p>The peaceful sit-in committee rejecting the Saudi presence in the Yemeni province of Al-Mahrah denounced, Wednesday, the attempt to storm the Shahan port, adding that the Saudi occupation and its militias attacked the citizens and members of the tribes of the Shahan district without any reason.</p><p>The sit-in committee added that the presence of the Saudi occupation forces and their militias in Al-Mahrah governorate violated international laws.</p><p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=11295">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=11295</a></span></p><p>and</p><p>(* A K P)</p><p>In Yemen Saudi Arabia now faces pushback from eastern tribe</p><p>Now it appears the Saudis may be creating a new enemy apart from the Houthis who control much of the north and are supported by Iran.

Although this is not the first time Riyadh is publicly criticised in Yemen, it is the first time since the withdrawal of the UAE from Aden and handing the city over to Saudi military command.</p><p>The Transitional Council has also escalated rhetoric against President Hadi. Hani Bin Breik, vice chairman of the council, said history will remember Hadi as Yemen’s worst president, and demanded that he stops the “meddling of the Brothers” (meaning the Reform Party, or Yemeni Muslim Brotherhood) which the Transitional Council views as its arch nemesis. Tensions also escalated due to the ongoing rash of assassinations of security personnel, especially in the military, without any party claiming responsibility for the killing spree which has swept across Aden.
