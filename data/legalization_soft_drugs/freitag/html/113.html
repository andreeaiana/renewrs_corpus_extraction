Ending the war requires negotiations leading to an interim settlement that must include security arrangements providing for militia withdrawal from cities, a return to the political process pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 2216 and agreement on a transitional leadership. While these are matters for Yemeni parties to decide during UN-sponsored negotiations, Saudi Arabia’s buy-in will be essential, spooked as the kingdom is by what it perceives as an Iranian hand behind the Huthis and their attacks on Saudi territory. Reaching agreement will take time, a luxury Yemenis do not have. The immediate priority thus should be to secure agreement on delivering humanitarian aid and commercial goods to war-torn, besieged areas.</p><p>The descent into civil war has its roots in a post-2011 political transition that was overtaken by old-regime elite infighting, high-level corruption and inability of the National Dialogue Conference (a cornerstone of the 2011 transition roadmap) to produce consensus on power sharing and state structure, especially the status of south Yemen, where desire for independence is strong. The Huthis, a Zaydi (Shia) revivalist movement turned militia, thrived by framing itself as an uncorrupted outsider. They struck an opportunistic alliance with their old enemy, Saleh, against common domestic foes, including the Sunni Islamist party, Islah, the powerful Ahmar family and General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar (no relation to the family), all of whom had turned against Saleh during the 2011 uprising. When the Huthis captured Sanaa, on a wave of popular resentment against the Hadi government in September 2014, a majority of Yemenis were already disillusioned with the transition. Yet, the Huthis overstretched: trying to forcibly expand their writ over the entire country, they alienated new supporters and confirmed critics’ worst fears.</p><p>In March 2015, the internal power struggle was eclipsed and reshaped by a Saudi-led military intervention. Saudi Arabia views the Huthis as part of an expanding Iranian threat in the region. Under the leadership of King Salman and his son Mohammed bin Salman, the defence minister and deputy crown prince, it decided to attempt to reverse Iran’s perceived gains by pushing back the Huthis and reinstating the Hadi government. It rallied a coalition of nine mostly Sunni Arab states, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) prime among these.</p><p>The intervention has layered a multidimensional, thus more intractable, regional conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran onto an already complex civil war, significantly complicating prospects for peace. It has also solidified opposing domestic fronts that have little in common save for their position on the Saudi-led military campaign. On one side, the Huthis and Saleh have wrought a tactical alliance, despite their mutual distrust, against what they view as an existential threat. On the other, the anti-Huthi bloc is even more diverse, bringing together a range of Sunni Islamists, (mostly secular) southern separatists and tribally/regionally based fighters who reject Huthi/Saleh dominance but have radically different visions for the future of Yemen.</p><p>After nearly a year of combat, no side is close to a decisive military victory. Huthi/Saleh fighters are ensconced in the Zaydi northern highlands, while the Saudi-led coalition and its Yemeni allies are strongest in Shafei (Sunni) areas in the south and east. As the latter have pushed the Huthi/Saleh front out of southern territories, where they were largely viewed as northern invaders, a range of armed groups, including al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and southern separatists, have moved in to take their place. If the Saudi-led coalition succeeds in capturing additional territory in the north, which it appears determined to do, the result is likely to be a protracted, bloody battle producing additional chaos and fragmentation. For its part, the Huthi/Saleh bloc is significantly complicating peace prospects by increasing cross-border attacks into Saudi Arabia, a move that makes it more difficult for the kingdom to halt the conflict when it cannot boast a clear military victory.</p><p>Each side’s commitment to UN-led peace talks is lukewarm. Neither is defeated or exhausted; both believe they can make additional military gains; and neither has been willing to make the compromises required to end the violence. The structure of talks, too, is problematic, with Saudi Arabia, a core belligerent, conspicuously absent. Prospects for a ceasefire and productive Yemeni talks would be helped by direct high-level consultations between the Huthi/Saleh bloc and Saudi Arabia over sensitive issues such as the border and the Huthis’ relationship with Iran. Moreover, to succeed, UN-led negotiations must be made more inclusive, expanding as soon as possible beyond the Yemeni government and Huthi/Saleh delegations to incorporate other Yemeni stakeholders.</p><p>The immediate future looks bleak. The war has devastated an already weak infrastructure, opened vast opportunities for AQAP and IS to expand and widened intra-Yemeni political, regional and confessional divides. The UN estimates that at least 6,000 people have been killed, including over 2,800 civilians, the majority by Saudi-led airstrikes. Even if the UN can broker an agreement to end major combat, the road to lasting peace will be long and difficult. The country is broken to a degree that requires significant time, resources and new political agreements to overcome. Without a breakthrough, it will continue descent into state disintegration, territorial fragmentation and sectarian violence. That trajectory would have calamitous consequences for Yemen’s population and severely undermine Gulf security, particularly Saudi Arabia’s, by fomenting a new refugee crisis and feeding radicalisation in the region to the benefit of violent jihadi groups.</p><p>Following: 18 recommendations to all parties of the war.</p><p><a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/iraq-iran-gulf/yemen/167-yemen-is-peace-possible.aspx">http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/iraq-iran-gulf/yemen/167-yemen-is-peace-possible.aspx</a> = <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=966634940056203&amp;id=961126490607048">https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=966634940056203&amp;id=961126490607048</a></p><p><strong>8.2.2016 – Aljazeera (** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen Revolution: 'Our dream was sold'</strong></p><p>Yemen has had many conflicts but has also possessed exceptional survival skills.</p><p>In November 2011, the European Union delegation and the G10 diplomatic group, composed of the five permanent UN Security members and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, sponsored a power-transfer deal. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/04/201142523156122610.html">GCC initiative</a> was signed by President Ali Abdullah Saleh at a ceremony in Riyadh. It involved the transfer of his powers to his vice-president Abd Rabu Mansour Hadi in return for immunity from prosecution.</p><p>In the name of pragmatism, our dream was sold. In the name of security, justice was forgotten.The people in the streets were excluded from the negotiations and hence this agreement fell short of the comprehensive changes they were demanding and mass protests continued.</p><p>The G10 countries informally assigned themselves the role of "<a href="http://yemen.usembassy.gov/g10nd.html">facilitators of the GCC Initiative</a>". For example, the French were to lead work on constitutional reform, and the Americans on security and military restructuring.</p><p>Some Yemenis <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/public/Research/Middle%20East/0312yf_summary.pdf">expressed concern</a> that "external actors taking on these roles might bring their own particular preconceptions to bear".</p><p>On paper, the UN-supervised <a href="http://www.ndc.ye/default.aspx">National Dialogue Conference</a> (NDC) was a good step, yet, the government appeared to be more concerned about winning the favours of the international actors than serving its own citizens.</p><p>Due to the insistence that the Yemen model was a success, NDC sponsors turned a blind eye to what was happening outside the conference halls. </p><p>After months of deliberations, Hadi extended his own tenure without an election and suddenly announced a federal system with six regions, with no consensus among NDC members or any decision in support of the move.</p><p>In July 2014, the government complied with the demands of the International Monetary Fund and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/11/yemen-imf-loan-idUSL6N0JQ2QI20131211">lifted all fuel subsidies</a>, increasing prices by between 60 and 90 percent overnight without notice and with no measures to ease the shock. Spontaneous protests erupted. Different groups, including the Houthis, capitalised on these grievances and recruited more members.</p><p>Houthi fighters extended their territorial control, and in September 2014 took over Sanaa after days of clashes. A new <a href="http://www.yementimes.com/en/1818/news/4365/Peace-and-National-Partnership-Agreement-signed.htm">UN-sponsored agreement</a> was not honoured leading to a series of escalations that culminated in Hadi's exile to Riyadh, the same city that once played host to Saleh.</p><p>Hadi, as well the international community, used the pretext of "legitimacy", just as Saleh had used the pretext of "constitutional legitimacy" in 2011, to attack protesters. </p><p>Today, war is being waged on Yemen by the same countries that protected Saleh and gave him his last life-line. The regional struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran has also played out in the tussle for influential in Yemen. Given the complexity of countries and agendas involved, more conflict is likely to happen. </p><p>So, while parts of the country are ravaged by a civil war, the greater war is clearly not just between two Yemeni sides as the mainstream narrative suggests.</p><p>In Yemen, there is a side that is focused on winning battles, but there is also a side that is focused on winning life. Yemen has had many conflicts throughout its history, but it has also possessed exceptional political and social survival and negotiation skills.

They not just are a sort of glorious Islamic revolutionists fighting on behalf of the poor and suppressed, in the footsteps of Che Guevara. They have committed a lot of war crimes, violations of human rights, have suppressed opposition and freedom of speech. Well, a long time the Houthi movement had many elements of such a revolutionary movement, but under the conditions of permanent war it changed a lot to a more and more suppressive force just fighting for its own behalf, its own survival, by that losing a lot of its former attraction. It is difficult to say how the Houthi movement would have developed under different circumstances, having been given the chance to act or to rule in a more peaceful environment, being able to realize a political agenda. Thus, that movement has been changed and formed to what it is now by the circumstances it existed in.</p><p>You off course cannot just regret this telling that things would have been much better if the Houthis would have met less resistance, and to blame those who resisted them. That would be much too simple. Within a country, there always will be different interests and parties opposing each other. Who is to blame are those interfering from outside into such conflicts – in the case of Yemen the Saudis, the US and the British. They are to blame for what the Houthi movement is now. Just compare the revolution in Cuba in 1959 and the Castro movement. What was the way it went? The US interfered again and again, fighting against the Castro revolution to overthrow it. Thus, in the following years, Castro Cuba turned to more and more suppression, turned to the modus of fighting for survival, turned to the Soviet Union to get a strong ally against the US wanting to overthrow it, and ended as a communist dictatorship.</p><p>8.2.2016 – Almasdar News (A K P)</p><p>Al-Masdar Podcast 05 – Fernando Carvajal and Hisham al-Omeisy on Yemen</p><p>In this week’s podcast, Brad Blankenship speaks with Fernando Carvajal and Hisham al-Omeisy.

Most of the city’s hospitals have shut down and the few that remain open are on the verge of collapse due to a lack of supplies. One resident’s new-born baby died hours after he was born because of severe oxygen shortages at the city’s hospitals.</p><p>“The Huthi forces appear to be deliberately barring the entry of civilian goods, including vital medical supplies and food, fuelling a humanitarian crisis with devastating consequences for residents of Ta’iz,” said James Lynch, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.</p><p>“Blocking humanitarian aid is a serious violation of international humanitarian law. Residents are effectively trapped within an enclave of Ta’iz and depriving them of basic necessities amounts to collective punishment of the civilian population.”</p><p>All routes into and out of Ta’iz are controlled by the Huthi armed group and its allies. Restrictions on entering and leaving the city have tightened significantly since the conflict began. Only al-Duhi crossing to the west of the city has remained open on an intermittent basis, leaving residents largely trapped inside.</p><p>Residents told Amnesty International that members of the Huthi armed group and its allies have stopped civilians crossing checkpoints from bringing in fruit, vegetables, meat, clothes as well as gas cylinders for cooking and oxygen cylinders destined for hospitals, in some cases confiscating the goods. International humanitarian law absolutely prohibits the blocking of medical supplies.</p><p>All parties to the conflict must allow unimpeded passage of impartial humanitarian relief for civilians.</p><p>Amnesty International spoke to five doctors in Ta’iz who said they are desperately in need of more anaesthetics, oxygen and surgical instruments to treat patients injured during ongoing fighting between Huthi and anti-Huthi armed groups inside the city.</p><p>Only four local hospitals within the enclave remain functional. Even these open and close sporadically depending on whether they manage to get hold of medical supplies, which in most cases have been smuggled in via a smuggling route over a mountain south of the city around 3,000m high.</p><p>Around 80% of shops in the city are closed and the prices of smuggled goods have soared, with basic supplies now costing around four or five times the usual local rate. Many residents are struggling to afford food to feed themselves and their families.

Accurately struck? Precision or unguided munitions? Does it matter at all for those on the ground? Whether in the towns, cities or villages of Syria, Ukraine, Yemen or elsewhere; whether in compliance with international humanitarian law (IHL) or not, the bottom line is often the same. Using explosive weapons in populated areas has a profoundly devastating impact on civilians. As conflicts are increasingly fought in populated areas, it’s a practice that must change.</p><p>The use of explosive weapons in populated areas may, in some circumstances, comply with IHL. Irrespective of this, however, mounting empirical evidence shows a predictable, widespread, short- and long-term pattern of harm to civilians. Data from Action on Armed Violence shows that in 2014, 41,847 people were killed or injured by explosive weapons. Of these, 78% were civilians (32,662). In populated areas, 92% of casualties were civilians.</p><p>The victims of explosive weapons often suffer complex injuries, which require emergency and specialist medical treatment, rehabilitation and psycho-social services that are often unavailable. For example, during the 2011 hostilities in Libya, an identified lack of training in dealing with such injuries led to many seriously injured civilians being sent abroad for treatment.</p><p>Access to healthcare may also be impossible because the use of explosive weapons has left hospitals and clinics damaged or destroyed, killed healthcare personnel or cut off supplies.</p><p>The use of explosive weapons in populated areas is a major driver of displacement within and across borders as people flee in fear of, or as a result of, attacks that damage or destroy their homes. </p><p>Explosive weapons frequently damage or destroy water, sanitation and electricity services with sometimes drastic consequences for civilians. The interdependencies between services mean that the destruction of a single electrical transformer, for example, can compromise safe drinking water supplies and the treatment and disposal of sewage, increasing the risk of disease – by Dr. Simon Bagshaw</p><p><a href="http://odihpn.org/blog/protecting-civilians-from-explosive-weapons-time-for-a-change-of-practice/">http://odihpn.org/blog/protecting-civilians-from-explosive-weapons-time-for-a-change-of-practice/</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp4 Kulturerbe / Cultural heritage</strong></span></h2><p>9.2.2016 – Apollo Magazine (D)</p><p>Urgent Initiative to Save Yemen’s Heritage | Following last week’s<a href="http://www.apollo-magazine.com/yemen-national-museum-hit-by-shellfire/">devastating reports</a> on the wanton destruction of Yemen’s cultural heritage, <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/2/5/american-professor-in-race-to-save-yemens-cultural-heritage.html">Al Jazeera has published a report</a> on an American professor’s attempts to digitise the war torn country’s unparalleled collection of around 50,000 rare manuscripts. ‘Within these manuscripts are inscribed the collective memory of a people,’ said <a href="http://ymdi.uoregon.edu/">David Hollenberg of the University of Oregon.</a> ‘Once this memory is erased, an important chapter of the story of what it is to be human is no longer recoverable.’ The tomes in question are held in three <a href="http://pudl.princeton.edu/collections/pudl0079">private manuscript libraries</a> in Sana’a, and represent the largest and most important collection of unexamined texts in the Arabic world. Hollenberg has been working on a project to safeguard the contents of the manuscripts since the 1990s. Last November, he set up Save Yemen’s Heritage, an organisation that aims to send digital equipment to the south Arabian nation so that local NGOs can record the priceless texts for posterity. At present, however, Americans sending funds to Yemen without clearance are liable for criminal charges, and SYH must obtain permission from the US Treasury before anything can be done.

So droht eine Ausweitung der Stellvertreterkriege</p><p>Eine unmittelbare militärische Konfrontation zwischen Saudi-Arabien und Iran, mithin einen direkten Krieg um die Vorherrschaft in der Golfregion, wird es nicht geben. Der Grund ist einfach - Riad hätte nicht die geringste Chance, ein Waffengang käme für das Königreich einem Selbstmord gleich. Sicherlich haben die Saudis nach Jahren massivster Aufrüstung auf dem Papier die <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/10/the-myth-of-the-iranian-military-giant/">stärkere Armee</a> mit den moderneren Waffen, und auch die Wirtschaftsleistung war in den letzten Jahren dank Ölreichtum deutlich höher.</p><p>Doch verfügt Irans Militär nicht nur über mehr praktische Erfahrung und besser ausgebildete Offiziere, sondern ist dem der Saudis dank Identifikation mit der Bevölkerung auch in punkto Motivation deutlich überlegen. Riads Soldaten kämpfen für Geld, Teherans hingegen für die Abwehr einer durchaus realen äußeren Bedrohung ihres Landes.</p><p>Auch die größere strategische Tiefe spricht für den Iran: Zuverlässige regionale Alliierte und Verbündete auf globaler Ebene machen einen Angriff auf das Land zum unkalkulierbaren strategischen Risiko mit Folgen weit über die Golfregion hinaus.</p><p>Die saudische Führung steht innen- wie außenpolitisch bereits jetzt unter starkem Druck. In Syrien und dem Irak befinden sich ihre Stellvertreter seit dem Eingreifen Russlands und dem Fall von Ramadi in der Defensive, und auch der eigene <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-saudi-idUSKCN0VA36T">Krieg im Jemen</a> kommt nicht von der Stelle. Das Abkommen mit dem Iran konnte Riad trotz intensiver Bemühungen nicht verhindern; nun muss es zusehen, wie Teheran politisch auf die Weltbühne zurückkehrt und mit <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/iran-china-agree-trade-deals-president-xi-jinping-meets-president-hassan-rouhani-1539709">Ost</a> und <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/28/hassan-rouhani-urges-french-business-sanctions-paris-medef">West</a> weitreichende Wirtschaftskooperationen vereinbart.</p><p>Um diesen unaufhaltsamen Abstieg zu verlangsamen, bleibt den al-Sauds nur noch eine einzige Chance: Sie müssen es schaffen, den Kampf um die regionale Hegemonie zwischen ihnen und der iranischen Elite als religiös-kulturelle Entscheidungsschlacht zwischen Sunniten und Schiiten erscheinen zu lassen. Wenn dieses irreführende Framing verfängt, können sie hoffen, sich - immerhin Beschützer der heiligen Stätten Mekka und Medina - als "legitime Führungsmacht aller Sunniten" zu präsentieren und so die gesamte sunnitische Welt für ihren Machterhalt einzuspannen.</p><p>Das Ziel der saudischen Führung wird es somit sein, nach Möglichkeit Andere für sich kämpfen zu lassen und den Krieg vom eigenen Staatsgebiet fernzuhalten. Um ein aussichtsloses direktes Kräftemessen zu vermeiden, muss sie sich bemühen, die Front so weit wie möglich auszudehnen und in zahlreichen Ländern Stellvertreterkonflikte zu inszenieren. Diese haben nicht zuletzt auch die Funktion, religiös Radikalisierte anzuziehen und zu "verbrauchen" - ein wichtiger stabilisierender Faktor für das Königreich, das für diesen "Aderlass zorniger junger Männer" auf permanente Kriege in der muslimischen Welt angewiesen ist.</p><p>Die <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/20/u-n-envoy-signals-that-riyadh-is-obstructing-syria-peace-talks/">Blockade</a> der Syrien-Gespräche scheint diese Einschätzung ebenso zu bestätigen wie eine Reihe schwerer <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-violence-idUSKCN0UP1R420160111">Anschläge im Irak</a>, der Türkei, Indonesien, Pakistan, Syrien und nicht zuletzt <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/29/shia-mosque-attacked-saudi-arabia">in Saudi-Arabien</a> selbst in den letzten Wochen.

Saudi military’s representative, Brigade General Ahmed Assiri, already said that “Saudi Arabia intends to destroy the Islamic State,”</p><p>Such announcements were shortly after Turkey’s declaration it is considering launching a ground operation in Syria.</p><p>At first glance, the Saudi proposal follows the policy laid out by Washington. Barack Obama in his capacity as the head of anti-ISIS coalition, has refused to place ground troops in Syria for the longest time, stating that local armies ought to destroy ISIS and stabilize the conflict zone. SecDef Ash Carter recently complained that US coalition partners are insufficiently support of US efforts, and during the Davos forum in late January he said that “there will be no free riders.”</p><p> However, experts believe that placing Saudi forces in Syria would likely be a terrible move, leading to catastrophic consequences. They believe Riyadh does not want to stabilize the situation but exact vengeance on its main adversary, Iran.</p><p>Since starting operations in Syria in September of 2014, Saudi forces dropped relatively few bombs. Moreover, Saudi ground forces are utterly untested militarily, as they are mainly used to protect borders and fulfill police roles, not to wage large-scale operations.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is, moreover, pursuing objectives very different from those of the US or of most other participants in that conflict. The proposal to send troops is most likely an attempt to communicate to Iran that Saudi leadership will not allow it to conduct operations in support of Assad. Just as Saudi Arabia condemned Tehran’s involvement in the Yemeni civil war.</p><p>“Saudi strategic objectives are very different from ours. Any new foreign military contingent in Syria will only complicate the struggle against the main threat, namely ISIS. The Saudis know perfectly well what they want. They want to overthrow Assad,” Steven Kinzer, a senior researcher at the Watson Institute of International Studies at Brown University, believes.</p><p>Boston Globe published Kinzer’s article in which he describes what he calls “aggressive activities” of the Saudi government. As a result, the Saudis are considered to be less and less dependable, with Riyadh no longer able to count on full US support.</p><p>It’s not clear, according to Kinzer, how Saudi troops would cooperate with other ground forces in Syria, including the Kurds. In recent operations, the Saudis proved to be cruel and even criminal. UN has stated that the Saudi air campaign against the Houthis is in violation of international norms and should be investigated.</p><p>“I will consider any Saudi attempt to send troops to Syria an attempt to destabilize. It would result in Saudi forces drawing closer and closer to Iran.”</p><p>“Such a land operation would be guaranteed to undermine the already weak efforts to reach a peaceful settlement of the Syria conflict,” Kinzer sums up.</p><p><a href="http://southfront.org/what-if-saudi-arabia-invades-syria/">http://southfront.org/what-if-saudi-arabia-invades-syria/</a></p><p>7.2.2016 – Reuters (A P)</p><p>Saudi King Salman calls for others not to interfere in kingdom</p><p>Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Sunday called on other countries not to interfere in the kingdom's internal affairs in what appeared to be a rebuke to Riyadh's main foe <a title="Full coverage of Iran" href="http://uk.reuters.com/places/iran">Iran</a>, which it accuses of attempting to stir unrest.</p><p>"It is our right to defend ourselves, without interfering in the affairs of others.

Looking at the fact to which countries Saudi Arabia is spreading its Wahabite ideology – having spent $ 100 billion since the 1960s just on that purpose – Salmans demand is rather odd. These countries range from Germany to Indonesia. Not to forget the billions Saudi Arabia spent for terrorists worldwide, beginning with fueling Osama bin Laden and all sorts of islamists in Afghanistan from the 1980ies onwards. Did you forget the Saudi interference in Bahrain in 2012, and now the interference in Syria. Now, the Saudis even want to send troops to Syria, that would be no interference in your mind, Salman, or what??</p><p>Comment by Judith Brown: Wow this is so outrageous! This is a country that long interfered in Yemen - building Wahhabi institutions for indoctrination of Yemeni children, arming and funding one group against another, taking sides in internal Yemeni conflicts, (and in fact not on one occasion had the side Saudi backed ever won), manipulating the Yemen leadership, funding the arming of tribes so that they were more powerful than the Yemen government, the list goes on. And every time Yemen has come near to a democratic system that is worthy of the name, Saudi has stepped in big time - like for example when the UN in March had got all parties to agree to a system based on a fairly elected system, Saudi backed the unpopular despot Hadi who knew he could never get fairly elected and asked Saudi to kill the Yemeni people - which they obligingly did. And Saudi has also interfered in Bahrain and Syria to foment despair. So, Saudi Arabia, before you start telling other people that you have a right to rule as you want to - just look at yourselves.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154088018643641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154088018643641</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp9 USA</strong></span></h2><p>siehe auch „Am wichtigsten“ / Also see „Most important“</p><p>8.2.2016 – Huffington Post (* A P)</p><p>A Senator Is Questioning The U.S.-Saudi Relationship At Just The Right Moment</p><p>More and more people in Washington are unhappy with the kingdom, and it's running out of ways to respond.</p><p>When Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) recently gave a speech<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-murphy-us-saudi-arabia-relationship_us_56aba630e4b0010e80e9de96?trorbe29">challenging the United States' long-standing indulgent relationship with Saudi Arabia</a>, he did it in New York, where experimentation and radical thinking are more common than in stodgy D.C.</p><p>But the nation’s capital was listening closely. And some of its most influential players liked what they heard.</p><p>Murphy later told The Huffington Post that many of his fellow lawmakers have for some time been privately expressing the criticisms he made of Saudi Arabia -- namely, that it has encouraged the spread of a fundamentalist, intolerant strain of Islamic thought, and that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-yemen-war_562a9ac0e4b0443bb5640b85">the war it is fighting with U.S. support in Yemen</a> has achieved little besides giving al Qaeda more room to flourish.</p><p>“For whatever reason, even Congress, without these personal relationships [with Saudi officials], hasn’t been willing to say some of the things that I’ve been saying publicly over the last week,” Murphy told the HuffPost Politics podcast "So, That Happened." But, he said, none of his colleagues in the Senate have told him anything that suggests they disagreed with his speech.</p><p>Asked if he had received any pushback from Saudi representatives in the U.S., Murphy said he had not spoken to any of them in person since the address.</p><p>“I’m sure there are those in the embassy who aren’t happy with it,” the senator said.</p><p>Murphy's remarks might seem startling, given how close the U.S. has been to the kingdom and how often the Saudis have helped <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/world/middleeast/us-relies-heavily-on-saudi-money-to-support-syrian-rebels.html">achieve American goals</a> across the Middle East. But recent shifting attitudes in Washington have made this the right moment for Murphy to announce his skepticism of the Saudis -- and he's framed his argument in a way that makes it difficult to challenge.</p><p>Two current Obama administration officials, and one who recently departed, have praised Murphy's address in separate conversations with HuffPost, each one saying they are glad an influential figure is publicly asking questions about the U.S.-Saudi bond.</p><p>Such thinking has become popular in Washington over the past few years as the administration has prioritized the goal of a nuclear agreement with Iran, Saudi Arabia’s top competitor for influence in the Middle East.</p><p>Washington, which has <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2007/07/27/Washington-frustrated-with-Saudis/67671185548666/">gotten over serious frustrations with the Saudis before</a>, is probably not going to walk away from the relationship <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-iran-diplomatic-relations_us_569a41c7e4b0ce496424a582">any time soon</a>.</p><p>Still, the days that Murphy cautioned against in his remarks -- those of the U.S. reflexively supporting any Saudi endeavor or misstep -- just may be numbered – by Akbar Shahid Ahmed</p><p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-murphy-saudi-arabia_us_56b63058e4b01d80b24683ba?axde7b9">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-murphy-saudi-arabia_us_56b63058e4b01d80b24683ba?axde7b9</a>=</p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp10 Großbritannien / Great Britain</strong></span></h2><p>9.2.2016 – Colonel Richard Kemp (A P)</p><p>Britain must back its ally over Yemen conflict</p><p>In fighting the global war on terrorism, our preferred policy is to support and advise the indigenous forces of countries where violent jihad is taking a hold in a way that threatens our interests and those of our allies. This is preferable to deploying our own combat forces to deal directly with the problem, especially in the wake of long and costly campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>Such support, sometimes including military trainers and advisers in headquarters or at the front, not only helps to defeat the threat but also buys vital political influence.</p><p>It is vital to Britain and the West that the Iranian-backed Houthi insurgency against Yemen’s legitimate government is defeated. Yemen is of major global strategic importance, including for the stability of the Gulf and the security of oil supplies. We saw the rise there, due to instability, of one of the most dangerous terrorist groups in the world, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, responsible for many of the most devastating attacks in the region as well as in the US and Europe. Islamic State (Isis) also has a growing presence in Yemen.</p><p>The Saudi-led coalition cannot hope to bring stability to Yemen without the military intervention it has been carrying out. But do their actions cross our red lines? Despite the UN’s accusations it is unlikely that Saudi operations have involved deliberate, systematic targeting of the civilian population.</p><p>The Saudis are fighting a legal war in Yemen. If they are doing all they can to avoid killing civilians, inadequate military capability and experience does not make their action criminal.</p><p>As we saw with Hamas in the 2014 Gaza conflict, there is evidence that the Houthis have been falsifying imagery and distorting casualty statistics to mislead the UN, human rights groups and the media. Like their jihadist bedfellows everywhere, they have been killing civilians deliberately and without restraint.</p><p>The UN’s unsubstantiated accusations of war crimes plays into the hands of the Houthi insurgents and encourages their continued violence, including use of human shields. This flawed report is part of a growing trend of politically motivated activism that makes it more difficult for western nations, sensitive to allegations of collusion in war crimes, to act effectively in this type of conflict.

The only thing that counts are the own geostrategic and economic interests, and nothing else. Therefor we make use of others, to avoid own deaths and making dirty our own hands. Brown, Arab, Third-World lives don’t matter, they are not worth a word. And to stay on the line, the easiest thing is just to deny reality: “It is unlikely that Saudi operations have involved deliberate, systematic targeting of the civilian population”. And, still this: “The Saudis are fighting a legal war in Yemen”. Where should this legitimacy come from? There is no legitimacy in this war. Keeping a “legitimate” government in office, even if that means to bomb the whole country to ruins? Don’t forget, the term of president Hadi and his government finally ended at February 25, 2015, one month before the Saudi aerial war started. He has less legitimacy than president Yanukovich of Ukraine had when he was overthrown by the Maidan coup in February 2014.

We came under attack when a hotel was bombarded and we were in a lot of danger but now, our strategy is to ensure our presence throughout Yemen.”</p><p>Mr Bahah said that strategy aimed at putting an end to all terrorist attacks and ensuring Aden was liberated with no remaining militia, such as Ansar Al Sharia.</p><p>“We have learnt from history that when there is conflict, we involve tribes, but now, this is a different case. The Iranian intervention is very clear. It is making decisions on behalf of other parties and the game being played by Iran is unfortunate.”</p><p>Those loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh have weakened the army.</p><p>“[Some] military men are not working the way they should be,” he said. “Twenty thousand men were unable to take on 6,000 from Daesh and they were probably followers of Saleh.</p><p>Yemen has a vision to reconstruct after the war. “It will not be easy,” he said. “The West had a marshal plan and we hope to have our own Gulf plan to develop Yemen.

Any hesitation from GCC to help would have put the whole region in trouble.”</p><p>Below are a few questions and answers from the session.</p><p>Question: Who stands behind Houthis?</p><p>Answer: We took over Mukalaf city in Hathramout. In this place we had 20,000-strong army who cooperated with Houthis and helped them. This is a proof that they are supported by ex-president Saleh.</p><p>Question: We hear a lot about fights on the borders of San'aa?</p><p>Answer: We want peace talks but they don't want peace. Iran is behind this and they are encouraging the conflict and supporting it to continue. It is very clear that Iran is behind it.</p><p>Question: Why Houthi militia is so stubborn?</p><p>They are being controlled from outside Yemen and once this control is over, this conflict will be over and we will have peace. We are in control of more than 80% of the land in Yemen.</p><p>Our priority is military, but people are in need of healthcare and this is what we are doing, and GCC is helping us a lot in all these fields. Hopefully, Yemen will return to peace and will be a happy Yemen like before, and it will be a good neighbour to the GCC countries.</p><p><strong>Are you in conflict with the Yemen president?</strong></p><p>I am like a son of the president, and because of the current situation which is difficult, we have some issues, but they are neither conflicts nor problems.</p><p><a href="http://www.emirates247.com/worldgovsummit-yemen-will-be-a-good-gcc-neighbour-says-bahah-2016-02-09-1.620415">http://www.emirates247.com/worldgovsummit-yemen-will-be-a-good-gcc-neighbour-says-bahah-2016-02-09-1.620415</a> see also from WAM <a href="http://www.fananews.com/en/uae/297504/">http://www.fananews.com/en/uae/297504/</a> and also <a href="http://www.gconew.com/military/148236/military-progress-to-continue-until-peace-is-achieved-in-yemen-bahah-says.html">http://www.gconew.com/military/148236/military-progress-to-continue-until-peace-is-achieved-in-yemen-bahah-says.html</a></p><p>Comment: These two articles complement each other quite well to show what Bahah had said. This is a combination of nearly all elements of Saudi propaganda (the UAE and Hadi government propaganda being quite the same).</p><p>Comment: Well Bahah is already seeing himself as the next President of Yemen in waiting. It is said that his relationship with Hadi is very tense ; Hadi after all wants to be president himself. As for the Yemeni people - well their views are secondary to that of King Salman and his unruly son Mohammed and anyway they can't be trusted to vote for the right people. Meanwhile Bahah has arrived in Aden three times 'permanently' and had to leave because it was unsafe for him. So how on earth is he controlling 80% of Yemen as claimed, when it is even too unsafe for him to stay in its only 'liberated' city - let alone stay in the rest of Yemen that is either controlled by militias or is in a state of active warfare.</p><p><a>https://www.facebook.com/yemennewstodayenglish/posts/1098355453650278</a></p><p>Comment: I have to say I don't understand the headline - the wording is confusing. But it is true that this Saudi led attack in Yemen has always had US approval - of course it has, otherwise they would never have started it - US is still the world's hegemon - for now. And like all such attacks that are out of proportion to any 'crime' and also the circumstances leading up to the war subject to many interpretations - there is widespread world concern - especially as Saudi is hardly noted for its human rights record. They have 'sold' the war to Washington a long time ago, and with it 'sold' the dreams of ordinary Yemenis who want nothing more than to get on with their lives. Or maybe, it might be truer to say that Saudi fell for US manipulation and took on the Yemenis at the U.S. behest. Such is politics and war today.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/yemennewstodayenglish/posts/1098352843650539">https://www.facebook.com/yemennewstodayenglish/posts/1098352843650539</a></p><p>9.2.2016 – Hit 967 (A P)</p><p>GCC Secretary General says resolving Yemen conflict top priority</p><p>The Secretary General of the GCC says resolving the Yemen conflict is a top priority.</p><p>Speaking at the World Government Summit, Dr Abdul Latif Al Zayani said that the GCC is preparing for the first day of peace to start the reconstruction process.</p><p>Al Zayani also highlighted the importance of ensuring that the international community respects UN resolutions and international treaties, calling for all human rights violations in Yemen to be documented.</p><p>He also praised the UAE’s role in restoring Yemen’s legitimate government and said that the rebuilding process will ensure that Yemen’s economy is integrated with the Gulf’s economy.</p><p><a href="http://hit967.ae/gcc-secretary-general-says-resolving-yemen-conflict-top-priority/">http://hit967.ae/gcc-secretary-general-says-resolving-yemen-conflict-top-priority/</a></p><p>Comment: No new elements of propaganda also here.

Gen. Ahmad Asiri, spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, emphasized the Saudi reasoning for intervening in Yemen.</p><p>Asiri's briefing, delivered via Skype to a small audience at the Center for a New American Security, was the first time a coalition representative has answered questions about the U.S.-supported war at a Washington event.</p><p>"It is not in the interest of one of the countries in the region if Yemen becomes another Somalia or another Libya," Asiri said. "So we decided to go and to give help in a military manner to the government."</p><p>Asiri didn't indicate when the coalition might conclude the operation, saying the Saudis were waiting for U.N. negotiations between the Houthis and the government of Saudi-backed President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Asiri blamed members of the U.N. Security Council for failing to help the process and the media for offering too little coverage of U.N. mediation efforts.</p><p>Asked about the increasing unpopularity of the war in Washington, Asiri said that the U.S.-Saudi relationship was about "more than weapons sales" and that the White House understood the Saudi focus on Yemen, given its long border with the kingdom.</p><p>"We need to defend ourselves," Asiri said. He noted that the Saudis on Monday <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2016/02/08/Saudi-intercepts-scud-from-Yemen-over-Khamis-Mushait.html">used a U.S.-provided defense system</a> to intercept a scud missile fired at a Saudi city from within Yemen. </p><p>The Saudis see Yemen a key arena for their regional competition with Iran. They and the U.S. both say Iran has supported the Houthis as a thorn in Saudi Arabia's side. Asiri mentioned Iranian misdeeds repeatedly during his comments.</p><p>But Iran's links to the Houthis -- whether they involve control or just occasional limited support -- remain opaque.</p><p>Saudi Arabia believes the Houthis will eventually surrender the Yemen capital, Asiri said, and the coalition does not wish to fight within the crowded, populous city.</p><p>Asiri's talk failed to allay some concerns raised by his audience of foreign policy analysts and reporters.</p><p>Two experts asked about the Saudi plan for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, the Yemeni branch of the armed extremist group.</p><p>Asiri said the Houthis and their prime patron, former Yemeni president and one-time Saudi ally Ali Abdullah Saleh, are inseparable from al Qaeda. Both, he argued, are signs of the chaos in the "nongoverned space" of Yemen. The Saudis believe they are weakening AQAP by weakening the Houthis, he added.</p><p>David Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, asked Asiri if even one of the airstrikes in the 11-month campaign have hit any al Qaeda or Islamic State target in Yemen. Asiri couldn't name an example – by Akbar Shahid Ahmed</p><p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saudi-arabia-defend-yemen_us_56b9163de4b08069c7a87da0">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saudi-arabia-defend-yemen_us_56b9163de4b08069c7a87da0</a></p><p>Comment: Asiris best propaganda plots are:</p><p>"It is not in the interest of one of the countries in the region if Yemen becomes another Somalia or another Libya. So we decided to go and to give help in a military manner to the government." Well, by this “help”, you finally turned Yemen into another Somalia or Libya, not to forget Syria.</p><p>"We need to defend ourselves", just forgets that Houthi missiles to Saudi Arabia just are a – in comparison very weak – response to the Saudi air raids at Yemen.</p><p>“The Saudis believe they are weakening AQAP by weakening the Houthis”, turns upside down. By fighting the Houthis, deadly enemies of AQAP, while leaving AQAP in the cold, the Saudis just let AQAP grow and grow.</p><p>8.2.2016 – Gulf Business (A P)</p><p>UAE will "extinguish fire in Yemen" - deputy PM</p><p>Sheikh Saif says UAE made a "sound decision" to get involved in Yemen</p><p>The United Arab Emirates' decision to take part in the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in Yemen was a "sound" one, asserted the country's deputy Prime Minister and minister of Interior. </p><p>Addressing the World Government Summit in Dubai on Monday, Sheikh Saif Bin Zayed Al Nahyan praised the role played by UAE troops in assisting Yemen.</p><p>"The UAE rushed to protect our brothers in Yemen to restore hope and give back the rights to its people," he said.</p><p>Comparing the problem in Yemen with the recent Address Hotel fire in Dubai, he said: "Had we not intervened in Yemen, the fire would have spilled over into the adjacent countries and into our own homes.</p><p>"We have no doubt that we will be able to extinguish the fire in Yemen just like we did the Address fire," he added.</p><p><a href="http://www.gulfbusiness.com/articles/country/yemen/uae-will-extinguish-fire-in-yemen-deputy-pm/">http://www.gulfbusiness.com/articles/country/yemen/uae-will-extinguish-fire-in-yemen-deputy-pm/</a></p><p>Comment: It is even possible to talk more nonsense than Asiri does.</p><p>8.2.2016 – Sputnik News (A P)</p><p>US, Saudi Arabia May Start Talks on Yemeni Settlement in Few Weeks</p><p>Washington and Riyadh hope to start negotiations on the Yemeni crisis settlement in the next few weeks, US Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday at a joint press conference with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir.</p><p>At a meeting earlier in the day, Kerry and Jubeir discussed a number of issues regarding peace and stability in the Middle East, including resolution of Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Syrian crisis settlement and fight against terrorism in the region.</p><p>"We also talked about Yemen and the hope that perhaps over the course of these next weeks it may become possible to try to engage in some productive conversations about how to bring that conflict to a close," Kerry said.</p><p><a href="http://sputniknews.com/politics/20160208/1034425260/us-saudis-may-soon-start-yemen-talks.html">http://sputniknews.com/politics/20160208/1034425260/us-saudis-may-soon-start-yemen-talks.html</a> and by Reuters: <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-yemen-idUSKCN0VH1RC">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-yemen-idUSKCN0VH1RC</a></p><p>Comment: Saudi Arabia and the US join to “conversations about how to bring that conflict to a close”, that does not have anything to do with any sort of “peace talks”, as there are just two allies fighting on one side are speaking. “Bring that conflict to a close” could also mean to double or to triple the bombing of Yemen.
