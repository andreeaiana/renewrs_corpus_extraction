Months later, in March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition launched its air campaign to prevent the rebels, known as Houthis, from overrunning the country’s south.</p><p>Saudi-led airstrikes have hit schools, hospitals and wedding parties and killed thousands of Yemeni civilians. The Houthis have used drones and missiles to attack Saudi Arabia and have targeted vessels in the Red Sea.</p><p>Civilians have suffered the most in the conflict, which has created what the United Nations says is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.</p><p>ACLED said approximately 20,000 people have been killed this year, already making 2019 the second-deadliest year on record after 2018, with 30,800 dead.</p><p>The non-governmental organization said April was the most lethal month so far this year, with over 2,500 reported killed, compared to approximately 1,700 in September.</p><p>It said up to 1,100 civilians have been killed so far in 2019, with targeted anti-civilian violence was centered in the provinces of Dhale, Hodeida, Hajjah and Taiz.</p><p>The project said the Saudi-led coalition and its allies were responsible for more than 8,000 deaths resulting from the direct targeting of civilians since 2015, and the coalition airstrikes caused around 67% of all reported civilian deaths.</p><p>ACLED said that although the number of Saudi-led coalition airstrikes is at an all-time low, civilian fatalities from air raids have risen for the first time since the end of 2017, more than doubling in the third quarter of 2019, compared to the previous quarter, primarily due to a strike on a prison facility in Dhamar province that killed at least 130 detainees.</p><p>The group said it recorded over 19,000 people killed in the southwestern province of Taiz since 2015, making it the most violent province in Yemen, largely due to a four-year siege by the Houthis, the group said.</p><p>Hodeida and Jawf followed Taiz as the next most violent provinces, with more than 10,000 total reported killed in each region since 2015, according ACLED.</p><p>The data covers everything from airstrikes, shelling and ground battles between the various forces to militant bombings and violence at protests. But their numbers do not include those who have died in the humanitarian disasters caused by the war, particularly starvation.</p><p>The group, which receives funding in part from the U.S. State Department and Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, builds its database on news reports from Yemeni and international media and international agencies.</p><p><span><a href="https://apnews.com/b7f039269a394b7aa2b46430e3d9b6bc">https://apnews.com/b7f039269a394b7aa2b46430e3d9b6bc</a></span></p><p>and ACLED statement here: <span><a href="https://www.acleddata.com/2019/10/31/press-release-over-100000-reported-killed-in-yemen-war/">https://www.acleddata.com/2019/10/31/press-release-over-100000-reported-killed-in-yemen-war/</a></span></p><p>My comment: The figure still is too low: Those killed by consequences of the Saudis blockade, of the consequences of the breakdown of the economy, of the breakdown of imports, of the breakdown of the health system and the supply of clean water, the total number would be 230,000 at least.</p><p>Comments: Not counting the countless lives lost from the world’s worst humanitarian crisis created by the conflict (like the conservative estimate of 85,000 children that starved to death between 2015 and 2018)</p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/MaherFarrukh/status/1190028926850150401">https://twitter.com/MaherFarrukh/status/1190028926850150401</a></span></p><p>"The numbers do not include people who have died in humanitarian disasters caused by the war, particularly starvation."</p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/YemenSource/status/1189961752215248897">https://twitter.com/YemenSource/status/1189961752215248897</a></span></p><p>“The true death toll is much higher when fatalities related to the lack of medicine, food and clean water are taken into account.

Fuel is hard to come by thanks to a Saudi-led coalition blockade and the fuel that is available has become prohibitively expensive. Airstrikes targeting farm fields and orchards have rendered large swaths of Yemen’s arable land too toxic to use.</p><p>Almost immediately after March 2015, when the war began, the Saudi-led Coalition began targeting Yemen’s rural livelihood, bombing farms, food systems, markets, water treatment facilities, transportation infrastructure, and even agricultural extension offices. In urban areas, fishing boats and food processing and storage facilities were targeted. </p><p>Before the war began, over 70 percent of Yemen’s population lived in villages dispersed in the mountains and small towns with irregular, and at times torrential, summer rainfall. These rural residents relied on agriculture and animal husbandry and grew fruits and vegetables to feed their own families and to sell to markets. Yet that way of life has all but disappeared since the Saudi attacks began, undermining rural livelihoods, disrupting local food production, and forcing rural residents to flee to the city.</p><p>Now, Yemen’s nationwide level of household food insecurity hovers at over 70 percent. 50 percent of rural households and 20 percent of urban households are <span><a href="http://www.fao.org/emergencies/countries/detail/en/c/161523">now food insecure</a></span>. Almost one-third of Yemenis do not have enough food to satisfy basic nutritional needs. Underweight and stunted children have become a regular sight, especially amongst the holdouts in rural areas. Families that have fled to cities are often forced to beg or to pick through the trash for food scraps. </p><p>According to <span><a href="https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/news/2019/Prolonged_conflict_would_make_Yemen_poorest_country_in_world_UNDP.html">a recent report</a></span> by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), poverty in Yemen has jumped from 47 percent of the population in 2014 to a projected 75 percent by the end of 2019 because of the war.</p><p>The intentional targeting of agriculture </p><p>The targeting of the Yemeni agriculture sector and rural livelihoods is not merely accidental collateral damage incurred while targeting military sites. Data from the country’s Ministry of Agriculture shows that in the period between March 2015 and March 2019, the Saudi-led Coalition launched at least 10,000 airstrikes that struck farms, 800 that struck local food markets, and about 450 airstrikes that hit silos and other food storage facilities in the country.</p><p>According to the Ministry, crop-area cultivation declined an average of 40 percent and crop yields by 45 percent in rural areas. Many farmers in these areas reported that they could no longer produce yields at pre-war levels due to the extensive damage to infrastructure, the high cost of diesel fuel and other agricultural inputs, a collapse in markets and the destruction of roads and storage facilities.</p><p>According to a field survey carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture in the period between March 2015 and March 2018, Saudi attacks completely destroyed 270 agricultural buildings and facilities, 43 agricultural associations, 9,017 traditional irrigation canals, 54 agricultural markets, and 45 export centers.</p><p>High precision U.S. bombs dropped by Saudi-led coalition warplanes destroyed at least 1,834 irrigation pumps, 109 artesian and surface wells, 1,170 modern irrigation networks, 33 solar irrigation units, 12 diggers, 750 pieces of agricultural equipment, 940,400 farms, 7,531 agricultural reserves, 30 productive nurseries, 182 poultry farms, and 359,944 beehives. </p><p>Yemen’s fishing sector has not been spared either. By the end of May 2019, every fish off-loading port in Yemen had been targeted by Saudi attacks. At least 220 fishing boats have been destroyed, 222 fishermen have been killed and 40,000 fishermen lost their only source of income. According to Yemen’s Ministry of Fishing Wealth, this has affected the lives of more than two million people living in coastal cities and villages.</p><p>Data shows that Saudi Coalition forces have stopped at least 4,586 fishing boats from leaving port in the directorates of Midi, Hajjah, Dabab, Bab al-Mandab, and in the Mukha districts in the Taiz governorate. Thirty fishing industry companies have left the country and about fifty fish factories have closed, causing catastrophic damage to Yemen’s fishing industry. Even before the war, Yemen’s fishermen were amongst the poorest segments of society.</p><p>As the war nears its fifth year, the Saudi-led coalition has continued to target the livelihoods of Yemen’s food producers. The coalition has expanded its military offensive to include large areas of agricultural lands and valleys in the K16, Durahami, Al-Jah, A-Tahita, Al-Faza, Jabaliya, Al-Mughrous, Al-Khokha and Hays countrysides.</p><p>Yemen’s breadbasket withers</p><p>According <span><a href="http://spate-irrigation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/war-impact-on-food-security-assessment-report-2017.pdf">to a study</a></span> by the Sana’a University-based Water &amp; Environment Centre (WEC) in collaboration with the Flood-Based Livelihoods Network issued in November 2017 to assess the impact of the current war on food security in Yemen, the war is already drastically aggravating Yemenis’ ability to earn a livelihood, rapidly deteriorating the availability of food and elevating the complexity of an already dire humanitarian crisis in the country. </p><p>The study, <span><a href="http://spate-irrigation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/war-impact-on-food-security-assessment-report-2017.pdf">The War Impact on Food Security in the Tihama</a></span>, (Tihama is a region of Yemen traditionally known to be the country’s breadbasket) showed how agriculture in Tihama, which sustains most of the country’s population, has been seriously disrupted by the war. This, the study’s authors say, is undermining the productivity and investment capacity of the entire country.</p><p>Creating a toxic legacy</p><p>The Saudi-led coalition’s blockade on Yemen’s ports, airports and borders has only exacerbated the suffering of the country’s farmers and rural residents. The coalition has prevented the export of their products, especially to wealthy Gulf countries which imported thousands of tons of pomegranates and vegetables from Yemen before the war began. Importing pesticides, agricultural fertilizers and fuel has also become difficult due to the frequent seizure of seafaring vessels by the coalition. </p><p>For 77 days, the coalition, led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has continued to hold ships loaded with oil derivatives at sea, preventing them from entering the port of Hodeida. The four ships that were allowed in carried transport fuel, not the fuel needed to power generators on which farmers rely.</p><p>Like in Tahamah, the blockade and attacks on agricultural targets across Yemen have not only destroyed machinery and infrastructure, it has had acute ecological impacts that may take decades to reverse.

Almost one-third of Yemenis (7.5 million) do not have enough food to satisfy their needs. Children being underweight and stunting is also much more pronounced in rural areas (62.1%) than in urban areas (45.4%). The average rural nutrition is poorly balanced, and the risk of micronutrient deficiencies is especially high. Food insecurity is highest among rural, nonfarm households, and livestock farmers.</p><p>Over 70% of population is living in rural areas in Yemen and about 50% of the labor depends on agriculture and its related activities for their living. Agricultural production is estimated to cover about 25% of the crop-based food needs.</p><p>The June 2015, June 2016, and March – July 2017 IPC analyses classified Al-Hodeidah , where more than 80% of Tihama is located, in IPC phase 4 (Emergency level), i.e. AlHodeidah is considered the most affected area by the ongoing war in Yemen (FSIS July 2017 IPC analysis). Between July and September 2016, WFP’s MVAM surveys found that the average of 18% of respondents in Al-Hodeidah reported large numbers of poor food consumption, with an additional 19% in the consumption borderline. During the same period</p><p>Agriculture in the Tihama region, being the main sustainment of the population, has been majorly influenced by the serious disruptions the agricultural sector is experiencing. The current war has negatively affected the productivity and investment capacity of the country. The supply and distribution of agricultural inputs and farm products to the markets have also been adversely affected. Affected people's coping mechanisms and safety nets are stretched to the limit as families adopt insufficient and negative coping strategies in order to survive (IPC Yemen August 2015)</p><p>The main objective of this assessment study was to quantify the impact of the ongoing war on food security to support the efforts of the international community to pursue their assistance for the affected poor and vulnerable population in Tihama, as well as best understand how to respond. It evaluates the food insecurity situation from two perspectives, the farmer's and the consumers', by understanding the challenges posed to establishing food security. The study also explored the direct and indirect impacts of war on food security and agricultural activities, while evaluating how those activities are in relation with food security and production. It eventually looked into coping strategies adapted by farmers and other water users, and any possible innovated simple solutions that they may be adopted to relief negative consequences on food security and thus ultimately on the livelihoods of the people.</p><p><span><a href="http://spate-irrigation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/war-impact-on-food-security-assessment-report-2017.pdf">http://spate-irrigation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/war-impact-on-food-security-assessment-report-2017.pdf</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/icrc">International Committee of the Red Cross</a>: Yemen: Ongoing Fighting in Al Dhaela Province Triggers New Wave of Displacement</strong></p><p>Renewed fighting in Al Dhalea province has caused thousands of families to flee their villages under harsh circumstances.</p><p>According to the displacement tracking report by IOM, over 65,000 people had left their homes from January to September 2019. This of course does not include the new wave of IDPs, which number is unknown. Families are saying that more people are on their way or trying to find the right timing to flee.</p><p>The ICRC and Yemen Red Crescent Society teams were in Al Khobar town distributing food and essential household items to displaced people when they saw scores of newly displaced families coming from various parts of the region.</p><p>ITW Fatima Mohammed – Displaced from Subaira</p><p>“The clashes are intense. We were sitting very scared in the corner of a room. The kids were terrified and crying. The bullets reached inside our houses. Three of us got injured back there, and the rest of our families is unable to flee.”</p><p>They had to walk in the middle of the night for hours crossing areas contaminated by unexploded ordnance, with very limited access to food and water. Some people were seen on top of each other riding pick-up trucks going from one place to another looking for shelter. Newly displaced people have difficulties to find a place to settle down.</p><p>Several buildings and schools in al-Dhalea have become shelters for families who fled the fighting since the beginning of the year. These facilities are overcrowded, full of young men, women, and children who have no source of income.</p><p>Desks in the classrooms are piled up on top of each other, pushed towards the walls to make room for what would become the home of many of the displaced families. Some classrooms host two to three families (15-25 people). As water is scarce in the area, school latrines are not functioning.</p><p>Families who fled from the other side of the frontline during the past months are still displaced and unable to go back to their villages as their homes are destroyed and their areas are heavily contaminated with remnants of war.

The project aimed to enhance food security and to support livelihood activities, savings groups, and the resilience of communities with the rehabilitation of critical, community-identified shared assets. The program design was aligned with the Humanitarian Development Nexus framework, which focuses on a shift from supplying humanitarian assistance to those who need it to reducing the demand for humanitarian assistance by addressing the root causes of these needs.</p><p>Program beneficiaries—2,100 of the most vulnerable and food insecure households in 36 villages— received MPC over ten cycles and completed projects that rehabilitated community assets, many through Cash for Work (CFW). Community projects included rehabilitation of water sources and facilities, market access roads improvements, formation of village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs), and trainings on best practices in certain livelihoods.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/addressing-food-crisis-yemen-executive-summary-evaluation">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/addressing-food-crisis-yemen-executive-summary-evaluation</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/wfp">World Food Programme</a></span>: Yemen Emergency Dashboard, October 2019</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-emergency-dashboard-october-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-emergency-dashboard-october-2019</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>CARE builds water tanks &amp; latrines in Yemen for conflict-affected people</p><p>Water is scarce in <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Yemen">#Yemen</a></span>, &amp; women and children often have to travel long distances to find water for their families.

to merge the Yemeni government of Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi and the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) into a unity regime has raised hopes that peace in the war-torn country is on the horizon.</p><p>Yet this “deal” is really an opportunity for external powers to shore up their own influence in the country, given that the two Yemeni factions have received divergent support from Saudi Arabia and the UAE respectively.</p><p>Strategic alliance</p><p>Yet, determined to preserve their own strategic regional alliance, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have pushed for unity between these rival factions. The UAE again withdrew some forces after Saudi troops <span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/saudis-take-control-of-yemens-aden-to-end-stand-off-between-allies-idUSKBN1WT19R">arrived</a></span> in Aden earlier this month to reclaim the city.</p><p>Though this has alleviated Saudi-UAE divisions over Yemen, in pursuit of its own geopolitical ambitions, Riyadh has temporarily regained an upper hand. It has re-empowered its favoured political actor, Hadi, while securing ties with the increasingly prominent STC, which attended the peace talks in Riyadh.</p><p>Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi must contend with Hadi’s presence, which it had <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190617-yemen-official-uae-planning-military-coup-against-president-hadi/">tried</a></span> to undermine with its secessionist ambitions.</p><p>Rather than seeking to improve Yemen's stability, Saudi Arabia supports Hadi - who is based in Riyadh - as he gives the kingdom legitimacy to intervene in the country’s politics.</p><p>This has been Riyadh’s long-term strategy in Yemen, rather than the official goal of fighting the Houthis.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has pursued a “soft power” strategy, politicising aid and investment to re-establish its traditional influence over its southern neighbour and make it dependent on Riyadh’s control. Its vehicle for this has been the <span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/saudi-reconstructions-program-in-yemen">Saudi Development and Reconstruction Program for Yemen</a></span>, which is <span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/saudi-development-and-reconstruction-program-for-yemen-delegation-meets-with-international-agencies-300936746.html">pursuing</a></span> dozens of “development” projects across Hadi-controlled regions.</p><p>Yet, these measures are a tool for consolidating Riyadh’s own links to Yemen. Saudi Arabia had <span><a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/wpf/files/2018/10/Strategies-of-Coalition-in-Yemen-War-Final-20181005-1.pdf">deliberately targeted</a></span> Yemeni infrastructure, food sources, agricultural centres and marketplaces under Houthi control, to weaken the faction’s prominence. This shows that it does not prioritise a strong Yemeni state, but rather supports a weakened Yemen that it can easily control.</p><p>Increasingly illegitimate</p><p>Though Hadi is the UN-recognised president, he is considered increasingly illegitimate throughout Yemeni society, particularly as he has been absent in Riyadh for more than four years. He has thus been unable to provide adequate security and services for Yemen. Saudi Arabia has still attempted to shore him up in the country, supporting his <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemeni-president-attends-first-parliamentary-session-country-houthi-coup">return</a></span> to a parliamentary session in Sayun in April.</p><p>The STC coup initially threatened such influence, particularly as the group was primarily backed by the UAE. Had a deal not been brokered, the STC could have seized control of much of the south.</p><p>Now Saudi Arabia seeks to appease the STC, aiming to reunite the government and separatists against Riyadh’s primary adversary in Yemen, the Houthis. Yet this risks triggering a further backlash in an already devastated country. The unification deal ignores Yemen’s dire security and stability situation. </p><p>Even though the Houthis reportedly <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-arabia-agrees-partial-ceasefire-yemen-report">supported</a></span> a ceasefire in September, this deal could reignite another conflict, while it ostensibly seeks to halt the violence between the government and separatists.</p><p>Meanwhile, the STC has yet to renounce its calls for southern independence, viewing the deal as an opportunity to secure greater southern autonomy, particularly as its terms are vague. Saudi Arabia will have to contend with this. Riyadh would likely oppose the STC’s wish for more southern independence, as it could shore up the Houthis in the north.</p><p>Separatist backlash</p><p>Not paying heed to the STC’s wishes and imposing Hadi’s vision for the country could trigger another separatist backlash, as <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/southern-separatists-accept-saudi-forces-yemen-government-not-welcome-0">tensions</a></span> persist between the two sides. The deal is therefore only a temporary solution, with Riyadh desperately aiming to avoid losing its influence in Yemen. </p><p>Saudi Arabia is playing a dangerous game. Yemen’s ministers of interior and transport survived an <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/yemeni-ministers-targeted-assassination-attempt-191029011211250.html">assassination attempt</a></span> hours after the peace deal was finalised. While no one claimed responsibility, it shows there is still opposition to the Saudi-backed government of Hadi.</p><p>Thus, while Saudi Arabia is temporarily back in the driver’s seat, it will still face obstacles to its political goals in the country, including the UAE’s own interests.</p><p>While the peace deal and the empowerment of Hadi hinders Abu Dhabi’s ambitions, it could still use the STC to push for greater southern autonomy – by Jonathan Fenton-Harvey</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/yemen-peace-deal-shores-saudi-and-uae-influence">https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/yemen-peace-deal-shores-saudi-and-uae-influence</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Op-Ed: After deal, Yemen separatists allow Saudi troops in south Yemen</p><p>STC supporter Saeed Bahashwan told Middle East Eye.“The Saudi forces are in military camps and they guide the SBF when they need advice, but the SBF control the ground and there is no Saudi fighter on the ground.”" The SBF stands for the Security Belt Forces, the military wing of the STC.</p><p>Saudis not implementing their part of the deal</p><p><span><a href="https://news.antiwar.com/2019/10/30/south-yemen-separatists-accept-saudi-forces-in-aden-but-yemen-govt-not-welcome/">The UAE kept a main provision</a></span> of the deal by withdrawing their forces from Aden and allowed Saudi forces to take their place.

For now, the Saudis and the Hadi government have made it clear that the STC should abandon its secessionist agenda. But whether the deal will benefit the government or the STC does not only depend on the agreement’s terms, but also on external factors and potential spoilers who might seek to undermine the deal and perpetuate violence.</p><p>The general reaction of Yemenis to the Riyadh-agreement has been confusion, skepticism, and even disappointment. This is likely due to both parties promising their followers an uncompromising victory during the brief, violent conflict in August in the South. </p><p>But a failure to come to an agreement would mean that the warring parties would continue to turn their guns against each other instead of fighting the Houthis.</p><p>With Saudi Arabia’s oversight and role as an arbitrator to oversee disarmament and redeployment, the Hadi government and STC are less likely to revert to violence. Moreover, the designation of an army unit to protect the Hadi government and STC leadership is a significant component of the agreement, given the precarious security environment, which includes assassination attempts</p><p>Adding to the list of challenges are potential spoilers, including disgruntled government officials who had strong positions against the STC and were affected by the conflict in Aden. </p><p>In addition, the Islah political party (loosely affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood) may not ultimately accept the agreement with the STC. While Islah’s leadership initially expressed <span><a href="https://almashhadalkhaleeji.com/news1912.html">support for the deal</a></span>, the Riyadh agreement avoided addressing the STC-Islah standoff, despite a history of violence and mistrust between the two. Islah is still one of the most influential parties in Yemen. Hadi’s vice president, Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, is affiliated with Islah and a critical mass in the Parliament represents its interests, with deep convictions against the fragmentation of the Yemeni state.</p><p>The Saudis have engineered this agreement to guarantee a concerted effort against the Houthis. However, it remains to be seen if the signatories themselves understand that the pact’s success will not be measured by short-term gains for their respective political establishments but in the provision of security and stability that will unlock further potential for the South and the whole country – by Fatima Abo Alasrar</p><p><span><a href="https://agsiw.org/saudi-brokered-deal-defuses-tensions-in-yemens-south-but-security-challenges-linger/">https://agsiw.org/saudi-brokered-deal-defuses-tensions-in-yemens-south-but-security-challenges-linger/</a></span></p><p>My comment: “The Saudis have engineered this agreement to guarantee a concerted effort against the Houthis”: Once again: This agreement would not be a step to reach a greater peace agreement for the whole of Yemen, but just for ramping up against the Houthis and for intensifying war against them.</p><p>(* B K P)</p><p>Mapping the Conflict in Yemen</p><p>What is the significance of this recent confrontation?

The Kingdom has resorted to playing the sectarian card in response to the ideological challenge posed by Iran, which tries to woo Sunni Muslims to its side by advocating a political system that combines Islam and a democracy of sorts. For its part, the Islamic Republic prefers to downplay the Sunni-Shiite split and emphasises the need for Islamic unity against foreign enemies, notably Israel and the US.

But now, three years into the Trump presidency, Washington's refusal to retaliate for the downing of an American surveillance drone by Tehran, preceded and followed by multiple oil tanker incidents in the Persian Gulf, has seemingly forced Saudi Arabia to accept that Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign is nowhere near what Riyadh had hoped. The Saudi establishment under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking a compromise with Tehran with considerable eagerness.</span></p><p>Earlier, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — another regional foe of Iran — started its own deescalation efforts.</p><p>On Sept. 30, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Saudi leadership's messages for reconciliation had been delivered to the Iranian president.

"But Riyadh insists on keeping the door closed until it gains full dominance over the Arab countries of the region," the diplomat told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity.</p><p>"Everyone acknowledges Iran's influence in some of the regional countries," the diplomat added. "This is the natural fruit of the bonds Iran maintains with those nations, whereas Saudi Arabia was to gain that influence through forceful measures — a policy that met with failure in Syria, Yemen and even in Iraq and Lebanon." </p><p>The Saudi outreach toward Iran is also seen in its internal politics.</p><p>Mohammed bin Salman "is preparing the ground for [his] kingship.

The article focuses on the practice of offering discounts on major sales of US arms, at a cost of billions of dollars.</span></p><p><span>These discounts are the result of the routine practice of providing waivers of fees that are supposed to be imposed on foreign buyers of US arms to reimburse the United States for a share of the cost of developing those weapons in the first place. According to a 2018 report by the Government Accountability Office, waivers were granted in an astonishing 99% of sales between 2012 and 2017 for a total of $16 billion. Many of the exceptions were made for non-democratic governments, including a $3.5 billion discount to the Saudi regime for a Lockheed Martin missile defense system. These waivers are good news for arms clients and weapons companies, and bad news for US taxpayers.</span></p><p><span>The waivers are a longstanding practice predating the Trump administration. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) has successfully inserted an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would require advance notice to Congress before discounts are provided. Her perfectly reasonable proposal has generated howls of protest from the Pentagon and the arms lobby, arguing that giving Congress input up front would unnecessarily slow down the foreign military sales process, perhaps costing the US key deals in the process.</span></p><p>Creating greater transparency over arms sales subsidies is unlikely to put a dent in the United States’ dominant position as the world’s leading arms trading nation. But blocking the ability of Congress to scrutinize the financial details of major arms sales does benefit one key constituency – major weapons contractors like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. To cite just one example, these four firms have been <span><a href="https://static.wixstatic.com/ugd/fb6c59_bd62e10ae7b745069e9a6fa897de6a39.pdf">involved</a></span> in roughly 90% of the $125 billion in US arms offers to Saudi Arabia over the past decade. Many of those deals for equipment that Saudi Arabia used in the brutal war in Yemen. There is a real question as to whether these sales to Saudi Arabia should be happening at all – offering them at a discount just adds insult to injury.</p><p>Arms sales discounts are just one element of a full-court press on the part of the Trump administration to bolster US arms exports.

the Yemeni government was filed with the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, and a hearing was held on late October.</p><p>Yemen's government has filed a request for a Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] with the US State Department in an attempt to claim ownership over Jewish cultural items it claims were smuggled out of Yemen illegally, Fox News reported.<br /> Among the items are a centuries old Torah scroll that was smuggled to Israel by the family of Manny Dahari, whose family has owned the scroll for at least 300 years.</p><p>Dahari told Fox News that if the request was granted by the US, then, “basically it would criminalize anyone who brings any of these items to the United States, or takes them out of those countries,"<br /> The Yemeni government submitted the claim under the guise that the Jewish items are “national cultural artifacts.”<br /> Jewish groups worldwide have asked the US government not to honor by Yemen’s request. <br /> “Jewish cultural property such as Torah Scrolls does not constitute the national heritage of governments who expel or who forced their Jewish communities to flee antisemitic prosecution,” Sarah Levin, the executive director of Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa [JIMENA], said.<br /> JIMENA wrote on their <span><a href="http://www.jimena.org/">website </a></span>that, "MOUs demand that the governments themselves show they are taking measures to preserve and protect the heritage in their own countries and the Yemeni government is complicit in the bombing and shelling of cultural sites, including

In Syria, the Iranian project has been set back by a Russian-approved US-Turkish deal, effectively blocking the strategic causeway Tehran was planning to complete its crescent of power, stretching all the way from Tehran to the Mediterranean via Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. In Iraq, there is a Shiite backlash against Iran’s excessive meddling in Iraq, to the point that protesters are chanting: “Iran get out”, despite a violent backlash from the IRGC-backed Popular Mobilisation Forces, who have fired live ammunition at protesters in Karbala, the consecrated heartland of Shiite religious doctrine.</p><p>In Lebanon, fear of Hezbollah has collapsed along with the unity government of accord it forms part of and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah is reduced to pointing the finger of blame. In Yemen, Iran’s expansionist project is facing a setback as the Saudi-Emirati exit strategy from the war is bearing fruit, giving Houthis a new path of belonging to a federalised Yemen, instead of looking towards Iran and its attempts at warmongering, with funds dwindling under US sanctions.</p><p>It is not clear what Iran will do under these circumstances but it faces some hard choices, especially if it insists on refusing to adjust and reform the regime’s expansionist logic. Perhaps the only thing Iran’s leaders can do now is to bet on US President Donald Trump not getting re-elected. This is now a distinct possibility.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/from-iraq-to-lebanon-iran-s-expansionist-project-is-under-siege-1.932256">https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/from-iraq-to-lebanon-iran-s-expansionist-project-is-under-siege-1.932256</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>In Middle East: Pull Down Facades</p><p>For years, Tehran has been trying to sell its expansionist strategist in the Middle East as a great success not only for the Islamic Revolution but also for Iranian nationalism.</p><p>In building their empire, the mullahs made a big mistake: they prevented the emergence of genuine local authorities, including national armies that could hold things together in a semi-autonomous way. </p><p>In the recent attack on Saudi oil installations, the Houthis heard about their own imaginary role in the operation from foreign media quoting Iranian sources.

And, unfortunately for the Iranian regime, this is the price that they are paying for an expansionist and revolutionary and violent foreign policy that has caused so much suffering,” said Hook, mentioning September’s attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, which the US has attributed to Iran, and attacks on Saudi Arabia by the Iranian-backed Houthis.</p><p>Hook said the US administration is making it harder for Iran to conduct foreign interference operations as “Iran doesn’t have the money that it used to.”</p><p>“This is money that the regime spends in places like Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen,” said Hook.</p><p>The Trump administration’s oil sanctions on Iran, which Hook described as unprecedented, have led to “a complete collapse of Iran’s oil sector.” Hook said US sanctions have collapsed Iran’s petrochemical, industrial metal, and precious metals sectors, as well.
