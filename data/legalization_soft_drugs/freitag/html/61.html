Dabei wird er zumeist als ein Krieg zwischen Sunniten mit der saudisch/emiratisch-geführten Militärkoalition auf der einen Seite und Schiiten mit dem Iran auf der anderen Seite dargestellt. Jemenitische Akteure werden bei dieser Darstellung oft nur als Marionetten ihrer ausländischen Schutzmacht verstanden. Eine andere weitverbreitete und sehr vereinfachte Sichtweise beschreibt den Krieg als einen Konflikt zwischen den Huthi-Rebellen und der international anerkannten Hadi-Regierung, die aus Sanaa geputscht wurde. Dieses Bild des Krieges wurde erst zuletzt bei den UN-vermittelten Friedensverhandlungen in Stockholm im Dezember 2018 bestätigt, da nur diese zwei Konfliktparteien an den Gesprächen teilnahmen. Die Realität ist jedoch wesentlich komplexer und betrifft eine Vielzahl weiterer Akteure, die signifikant den Krieg im Jemen und seine Fortführung beeinflussen, beziehungsweise umgekehrt auf seine Beendigung hinarbeiten könnten. Der Beitrag von Anne-Linda Amira Augustin, die als Referentin in der europäischen Auslandsvertretung des Südübergangsrates arbeitet, widmet sich den verschiedenen an der jemenitischen Krise beteiligten politischen und militärischen Akteuren, gibt einen Überblick über die wichtigsten Eckpunkte zur Entstehung des Jemen-Krieges und zeigt die fortschreitende Fragmentierung des Landes seit 2015 auf.</p><p>Fragmentierung im Jemen-Krieg: Drei Regierungen und eine Vielzahl von Akteuren</p><p>Noch im Jahr 2015 fanden erste UN-vermittelte Friedensverhandlungen in Genf statt, die ebenso wie die Gespräche in Kuwait ein Jahr später scheiterten. Basierend auf der UN-Resolution 2201 ist der Friedensprozess auf nur zwei Akteure, die Huthis und die Hadi-Regierung, fokussiert, was den lokalen Bedingungen nicht entspricht. Voraussetzung für diese Dichotomie ist der oftmals entstandene Eindruck, dass der Krieg zwischen den Huthis und der Hadi-Regierung geführt wird, dabei werden besonders der Hadi-Regierung verschiedene Gruppen zugerechnet, die völlig konträre politische Ziele zu dieser verfolgen. Der Krieg hat die bereits vor 2015 bestehende Fragmentierung des Landes noch weiter vorangetrieben und mit ihr auch die Stärkung lokaler Macht- und Regierungsstrukturen, die eine Rückkehr zu zentralistischen Staatsstrukturen, wie sie vor 2011 üblich waren, unmöglich macht.</p><p>Die Huthi-regierten Gebiete</p><p>Der Südübergangsrat</p><p>Nach der Befreiung Adens griff Präsident Hadi besonders auf Unterstützung von Südjemeniten zurück, setzte sie in hohe staatliche Ämter oder als Soldaten an der Front ein. Aufgrund der Unabhängigkeitsbestrebungen im Südjemen, die viele südjemenitische Politiker und Gouverneure ebenfalls unterstützen, entließ Hadi einige südjemenitische Kabinettsminister und Gouverneure im April 2017, darunter Aydarus al-Zubaydi, den ehemaligen Gouverneur von Aden. Nach Massenprotesten Anfang Mai 2017 hatte er begonnen, den Südübergangsrat aus der Südbewegung und dem Südwiderstand aufzubauen</p><p>Diese regierungsähnlichen Strukturen sollen die Unabhängigkeit des Südjemen vorbereiten und auch ermöglichen. Weiterhin bestehen andere Gruppen, die der Südbewegung angehören, jedoch unabhängig vom Südübergangsrat sind, aber mit ihm dasselbe politische Ziel der Unabhängigkeit des Südjemen teilen.</p><p>Hinzu kommt, dass mehrheitlich südjemenitische Soldaten an den Fronten aufseiten der Militärkoalition kämpfen, die in europäischen Medien zumeist als «Hadi-loyale Truppen» bezeichnet werden. Im Südjemen wurden die zahlreichen Milizen, die sich 2015 unter der Bezeichnung Südwiderstand gegen die Huthis formierten, mit Hilfe der Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate institutionalisiert und trainiert. </p><p>Die Hadi-Regierung</p><p>Die Interessen des Südübergangsrats stehen den Interessen der Hadi-Regierung, die an einer Einheit der Republik Jemen festhält, konträr entgegen. Präsident Hadi musste unter dem Druck der Huthis Ende 2014 zurücktreten und wurde unter Hausarrest gestellt, bis er im Februar 2015 nach Aden fliehen konnte, wo er seinen Rücktritt zurücknahm und Aden als Interimshauptstadt ausrief. Als die Huthis und Salih-Truppen nach Aden vorrückten, flüchtete er nach Saudi-Arabien, wo er Unterstützung im Kampf gegen die Huthis erhielt und seine Regierung im Exil wiederaufbauen konnte, die seitdem meist aus der saudischen Hauptstadt agiert und wenig bis kaum Präsenz in Aden zeigt.</p><p>Hadis engster nationaler Verbündeter ist derzeit die <em>Jemenitische Versammlung für Reform (Islah)</em>, zu der auch General Ali Mohsin al-Ahmar gehört. Im April 2016 ernannte Hadi den General zu seinem Vizepräsidenten. Al-Ahmar war der führende General im Kampf gegen die Huthis in den 2000er Jahren und engster Vertrauter Salihs, bis er sich während der Proteste des sogenannten Arabischen Frühlings 2011 auf die Seite der Jugendbewegung und gegen Salih stellte. Wegen der zahlreichen Kriege in Saada ist er nicht gut bei den Huthis angesehen. Im Südjemen wird er für das brutale Vorgehen der Armee während des Krieges von 1994 und seine Rolle bei der Beschlagnahmung von Ländereien im Südjemen verantwortlich gemacht. Die Islah-Partei ist besonders stark im Zentraljemen, in Taizz und Marib, vertreten, wo ihre Anhänger gegen die Huthis kämpfen. Taizz steht mittlerweile komplett unter der Kontrolle der Partei. Die von den <span><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2019/5/10/why-is-uae-occupying-yemens-socotra-island-">Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten </a></span>finanzierte salafistische Brigade Abu Al-Abbas, die in Taizz aktiv ist, wurde im April 2019 gezwungen, sich aus Teilen der Stadt zurückzuziehen. Aufseiten der Hadi-Regierung kämpfen ebenfalls Einheiten des ehemaligen jemenitischen Militärs, die nach der Ermordung Salihs durch die Huthis im Dezember 2017 die Seiten wechselten. Die sogenannten <em>Wächter der Republik</em>, die von Salihs Neffen Tariq Salih angeführt werden, kämpfen nun auf <span><a href="https://agsiw.org/yemen-after-hodeidah/">Hadis Seite.</a></span></p><p>Regionale und internationale Akteure sowie ihr Einfluss auf den Krieg</p><p>Hinter jeder größeren nationalen Kraft steht eine regionale Macht, die in lokale Geschehnisse teils enorm eingreift und damit auch den Krieg im Jemen und dessen Fortführung entscheidend mitbestimmt. Besonders seien hier drei Staaten genannt, die eine wesentliche Rolle im Jemen spielen: Saudi-Arabien, die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate und der Iran. Der Iran unterstützt die Huthis vor allem mit militärisch-strategischer Beratung sowie Waffenlieferungen. Allerdings sollte die Beziehung zwischen den Huthis und dem Iran nicht mit Irans Einfluss im Libanon, Syrien oder Irak gleichgesetzt werden. Der Iran hat deutlich weniger Einfluss auf die Huthis und damit auch auf das direkte Geschehen im Jemen – von Anne-Linda Amira Augustin, Referentin in der europäischen Auslandsvertretung des Südübergangsrates in Berlin. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.rosalux.de/publikation/id/40861/der-krieg-im-jemen-und-seine-akteure/">https://www.rosalux.de/publikation/id/40861/der-krieg-im-jemen-und-seine-akteure/</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335061643_Der_Krieg_im_Jemen_und_seine_Akteure">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335061643_Der_Krieg_im_Jemen_und_seine_Akteure</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>North and South: Who Benefits from a Divided Yemen?</strong></p><p>Why is the split between southerners and northerners only growing more pronounced? Could this lead to the reemergence of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) in the south? Why does the UAE support separatists in the South while Saudi Arabia backs the supporters of Hadi? How will this affect the future coalition? How do the Houthis stand to benefit from the confrontation in the South? What will Iran do?</p><p>The conflict between the two wings of the Arab Coalition (AC) in Yemen, essentially comprising its leader, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, took shape in 2016 in response to disagreements over the strategy for the military campaign in Yemen and the choice of Yemeni partners to carry it out. It was the UAE that initiated the military operation in the South in April 2016, using local paramilitary forces trained and equipped by the UAE military to liberate almost the entire Arabian Sea coast in Yemen from the control of Ansar al-Sharia, a group loyal to the leaders of the banned terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). </p><p>The terrorists’ imperious claims in the South, which had pledged loyalty to the AC, shocked the local population, which had been fighting radical Islamists consistently for over 15 years. The establishment of quasi-administrative bodies in these cities by the Islamists was accompanied by violence against the local Sunni population. The terrorists brought in several Salafi Islamist groups that had access to the Yemeni Muslim Brothers from the Al-Islah party, which was imposing its religious rules – new to the local population and intolerant of previous Yemeni customs – all throughout Yemen.</p><p>In September 2014, Al-Islah suffered a political defeat in the North from the emerging alliance between the Houthi Movement, Ansarullah, and General People's Congress (GPC), Ali Abdullah Saleh’s party</p><p>The Al-Islah leaders fled to Riyadh, describing the Houthis’ peaceful entry into Sana'a on September 21, 2014 as a “coup,” although President Hadi remained at his post in Sana'a until he voluntarily ceded power on January 22, 2015 by submitting his resignation to parliament.</p><p>In March 2015, the leaders of Al-Islah announced support for Hadi as the legitimate president and took the leading wartime positions in his administration. In early 2016, the informal leader of the party’s military wing, General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, was appointed deputy commander and vice president of Yemen. That appointment led to an emerging rift in the AC between the pro-Saudi and pro-UAE wings. The Yemenis’ attitude towards the general and the Al-Islah party determined, to a certain extent, the subsequent shifts in political sentiment both in the North and in the South.</p><p>Although the UAE-led antiterrorist military operation in the southern port cities was bloodless, and the militants were allowed to leave the cities and move to their camps with their weapons to avoid civilian casualties, it clearly showed that the UAE and the majority of the population of the South would not tolerate AQAP terrorists or even Muslim Brothers from the Al-Islah party in this part of the country.</p><p>In May 2017, the Southern Transitional Council (STC) was established in the South, headed by Aidarus al-Zoubaidi who had been dismissed the day before by President Hadi as governor of the Aden province. The STC’s founders include almost all the governors of southern provinces (former PDRY); its political manifesto was the program of Al-Hirak, the secessionist Southern Movement, established in 2007 with the declared goal of restoring the sovereignty and independence of the South. </p><p>In 2018, the conflict between the two flanks of the AC camp began to spread to parts of the South quite far away from Aden,</p><p>The situation in the South in 2018 was also aggravated by the STC leadership’s support for Southern paramilitary forces’ (Al Amalaqah Brigades) involvement in the Golden Victory offensive on the North Yemeni port of Hodeidah, which was later considered the key operation of the protracted and stalled military campaign in Yemen. Earlier, Al-Hirak categorically refused to fight against the Houthi alliance forces outside the 1990 borders of the PDRY. It was not until January 2017 that new paramilitary South Yemeni units created by the UAE first crossed the invisible border of the former People’s Democratic Republic to join the AC operations in the vicinity of the northern Yemeni city of Taiz. </p><p>The southerners’ involvement in the war in the North – while the AC parties installed their stationary military facilities on the territory of the South, dissociated from the war with the Houthis, where many of the military camps of President Hadi remained under the command of General Ali Mohsen – began to destabilize the South.</p><p>It would be premature to make any projections about how the conflict in the AC might develop from here. This is just part of a larger ball of contradictions that had existed in Yemen even before the foreign intervention, but have now reemerged in a new shape as a result of the disastrous war. Neighboring powers are vying in pursuit of their geopolitical interests in Yemen, and this fact keeps interfering with local developments, upsetting the balance of power between Yemen’s centers of political influence located in Aden and Sana'a.</p><p>Iran’s involvement in the Yemen conflict as the military campaign enters its fifth year is highly doubtful. </p><p>The absolute dominance of Ansarullah, a movement 50% comprised of the former ruling party GPC, in the the coalition regime established in Sana'a in August 2016 and having proved resilient since then, is equally dubious. The Sana'a-based core of the GPC still enjoys strong support both in cities and especially in the tribes, not to mention the bureaucracy, the army, and the parliament also reestablished that year. These aspects of the war have long been obscured by simplistic arguments about civil war and Iranian intervention spread by the media and politicians.</p><p>The conflict in Yemen requires a political dialogue aimed at restoring the country's statehood in a format that would meet the demands of its people. Apparently, there can be no return to the original political process – led by the UN and interrupted by the intervention – after the dramatic changes in the political scene of Yemen over the war years. However, UN mediation still can and should help select, as soon as possible, the best formats for a speedy settlement in Yemen with the participation of the new Yemeni centers of political influence that established themselves before they became too numerous – by Sergey Serebrov</p><p><span><a href="http://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/north-and-south-who-benefits-from-a-divided-yemen/">http://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/north-and-south-who-benefits-from-a-divided-yemen/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>The looming partition of Yemen</strong></p><p>After the UAE's decision to withdraw its troops from Yemen, the secessionist takeover of Aden was inevitable.</p><p>The success of Yemen's southern secessionists in taking over the city of Aden has opened a new chapter in the country's sordid history. It has effectively undermined all efforts to restore legitimate authority to the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and is endangering the territorial integrity of the country.</p><p>After the United Arab Emirates (UAE) decided to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/world/middleeast/yemen-emirates-saudi-war.html">withdraw</a> the bulk, if not all, of its soldiers from Yemen, it was inevitable that the secessionists would make a move against Hadi's forces in the south. In fact, what happened is very much part of the Emirati plan for southern Yemen, and particularly Aden and its seaport.</p><p>The UAE's love-hate relationship with Yemen</p><p>Geographically distant from Yemen, the UAE did not have the same degree of trepidation Saudi Arabia felt about threats and developments in that country over the past decade. Whether these emanated from the Houthi rebels on the kingdom's southwestern border or from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to its immediate south, they generally did not affect the security of the UAE.</p><p>Since the mid-2000s, the UAE has succeeded in <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/united-arab-emirates/b65-united-arab-emirates-horn-africa">striking deals</a> with several states along this stretch to manage commercial ports and establish military bases. The UAE has footprints in Djibouti, Somaliland and Puntland (both federated states in Somalia), and Eritrea.</p><p>These considerations have been at the heart of the Emirati strategy in Yemen since the launch of <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/features/2015/03/26/Allies-back-Saudi-led-Decisive-Storm-op-in-Yemen-with-fighter-jets-.html">Operation Decisive Storm</a> in March 2015. However, for the Emiratis, stopping the Houthis and maintaining the collective security of the GCC did not necessarily mean the restoration of Hadi's legitimate authority over the country.</p><p>To be sure, the Yemeni president never believed that the UAE was working to restore his legitimate rule and <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-yemen-president-says-uae-acting-occupiers">had fallen out</a> with its strongman, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ) a long time ago.</p><p>Indeed, the UAE has had a Janus-faced relationship with Yemen since the start of the Saudi-led coalition's operations there in March 2015. While officially supporting the Hadi government, in practice, the UAE has been helping and sustaining its opponents in the south and paving the way for secession.</p><p>The seemingly endless nature of the Yemeni war - now a quagmire in its fifth year - a slowing UAE economy, and tensions in the Gulf necessitated retrenchment and withdrawal from Yemen. Still, gains in the south of the country could not be forfeited, nor could the UAE's local allies be abandoned. That is why Abu Dhabi decided to allow the secessionist Southern Transitional Council (STC) to execute a coup against the Yemeni president and his government.</p><p>It is quite likely that the battle for Aden and its strategic facilities is only the beginning of a series of showdowns elsewhere whose ultimate aim is to remove all vestiges of Hadi's control in the south.</p><p>Whither Saudi Arabia?</p><p>Saudi Arabia's position on what happened in Aden in early August has been rather murky. News reports from the city and statements by Hadi government officials point to Saudi inaction against the secessionists. But no matter its current stance, Riyadh appears incapable of delivering on promises it made to Hadi when it decided to launch Operation Decisive Storm.</p><p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) hitched his wagon to MBZ's horse, apparently with no clue as to where the UAE was taking Saudi Arabia and Yemen. After four and a half years of military action in Yemen, MBS can hardly claim any success, as MBZ runs away with Yemen's south.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's anti-Iran axis also appears to give way. </p><p>As the UAE tries to slip out of a war it encouraged Saudi Arabia to start, the Saudis may now be wondering: with friends like these, who needs enemies?</p><p>Potential future scenarios</p><p>If not reversed, the takeover of Aden by southern secessionists may well be the final nail in the coffin of Yemen's unity and territorial integrity. While Saudi Arabia has announced that it will host reconciliation meetings between Hadi and his adversaries, there is no guarantee that they will be successful. Having allowed Abu Dhabi to do what it wanted in Aden, Riyadh will find it difficult to oppose the further territorial expansion of the STC.</p><p>Over the next few weeks and months, a number of significant developments spurred by the crisis in Aden could take place – by Imad K. Harb</p><p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/looming-partition-yemen-190819143901514.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/looming-partition-yemen-190819143901514.html</a></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>The UAE remains the most influential player in Yemen, despite its troop withdrawal</strong></p><p>While UAE officials and media have been reassuring the public that the withdrawal decision was made in coordination with Riyadh, the “redeployment” has highlighted disagreements between the Emirates and Saudi Arabia over Yemen. Some reports indicate that the closest associates of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman intervened to try to change the UAE’s mind. The Emirati troops have been described as the most competent within the Saudi-led coalition and so their “redeployment” could be a major blow for Riyadh’s war efforts, leaving its own troops more exposed. Despite assurances by UAE officials that their country remains committed to the coalition and its goals, the Emiratis’ move has been interpreted as a slap in the face for Saudi Arabia.</p><p>It is, therefore, unclear how the UAE decision will affect the coalition and Saudi-UAE relations. The Saudis have so far played down allegations about a rift with the UAE. </p><p>Divergent Saudi and Emirati agendas for Yemen have been apparent almost from the start of their intervention in 2015.</p><p>The UAE’s departure should not leave a vacuum, as it has trained some 90,000 Yemeni troops made up of former security personal, tribesmen and militia members from the south that would provide an effective ground force and secure the Emirates’ political leverage in this part of the world. </p><p>According to Anne-Linda Amira Augustin, a political advisor to the Foreign Representation of the Southern Transitional Council at the European Union, writing in her article “Security in South Yemen”, the [troop withdrawal] will not affect the whole country equally, as the UAE redeployment will mainly impact areas like Hodeida. In South Yemen, she believes that little or nothing will change on the ground because security is provided primarily by South Yemenis.</p><p>Augustin reminds us that the Republic of Yemen was already fragmented before the war.</p><p>Nowadays, the STC claims to have a strong presence in the different governorates in South Yemen. “Southern actors are better organised and positioned than before the war,” Augustin told MEMO, “and they are not willing to give up their achievements for the reestablishment of a centralised rule in Sanaa, under which they suffered for almost three decades. Going back to pre-2011 Yemen is impossible in today’s circumstances.”</p><p>For Cafiero, though, “As Yemen remains a failed state and the UAE continues to assert its heavy influence in the war-torn country, the possibility of Abu Dhabi and its proxies succeeding in re-establishing South Yemen as an independent state is real.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190819-the-uae-remains-the-most-influential-player-in-yemen-despite-its-troop-withdrawal/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190819-the-uae-remains-the-most-influential-player-in-yemen-despite-its-troop-withdrawal/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>The UAE and the coup de grace to Yemen's unity</strong></p><p>The UAE's actions in Yemen will have the same effect their policies have had in the rest of the Arab world: spreading disorder.</p><p>However, by seizing Aden, the interim capital, the STC is guilty of committing the same sin that the Houthis did at the outset. They overthrew the internationally recognised government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, initiating a de facto secession, striking a heavy blow to the unity of Yemen, and compromising not just its territorial integrity, but also its sovereignty and political independence.</p><p>Irrespective of whether southern Yemenis may hold some valid political grievances, staging a coup and further plunging the county into the dark abyss of violence is neither legal nor acceptable.</p><p>The STC has withdrawn from some of the critical posts it captured, but the UAE-sponsored putsch holds many essential lessons.</p><p>An act of epic treachery</p><p>The first takeaway is that the UAE's reputation has been - once again - struck a severe blow. The fact that the legitimate Yemeni government relied for its rescue on ''Operation Decisive Storm'', in which the UAE has played a central role, only to end up betrayed by the would-be saviour, is an act of epic treachery.</p><p>A long time in the making </p><p>From the onset, the UAE pursued a policy of establishing a parallel state, weakening the Hadi government bit by bit. It started with the establishment of a network of military camps and militia-run bases, over which the Yemeni government had no control.</p><p>Added to the mix are the egregious violations of human rights, including <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/former-yemen-allies-furious-uae-assassination-campaign-exposed">assassination campaigns</a>, the use of <a href="https://www.apnews.com/4925f7f0fa654853bd6f2f57174179fe">secret prisons</a>, and systemic enforced disappearances and torture, which have been labelled as war crimes by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/07/disappearances-and-torture-in-southern-yemen-detention-facilities-must-be-investigated-as-war-crimes/">human rights organisations</a>. </p><p>The reality is that the STC does not represent the entire south. Before 1967, there were about 18 sultanates, emirates and chieftains in control of large parts of south Yemen. Currently, there are other secessionist and regionalist movements in Al Mahra, Hadramaout, and other provinces, which are not represented by the STC.</p><p>One can safely argue that the UAE's designs are no more than a chimaera that will come tumbling down, sooner rather than later.</p><p>The biggest loser</p><p>Thirdly, the events in Aden demonstrate that Riyadh is on its way to become the biggest loser in Yemen.

Riyadh’s regional ambitions were thwarted by its <span><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/war-yemen-just-went-bad-worse-saudi-arabia/5684279">disastrous War on Yemen</a></span> that was supposed to catapult the country into becoming a global power, yet it’s this very same campaign that’s responsible for actualizing Abu Dhabi’s exact same vision instead and thus turning the two allies into frenemies.</p><p>The kinetic (military) aspect of the conflict has largely died down from its previous high of seemingly never-ending coalition bombings against mostly civilian targets, but the non-kinetic (political) aspect has only intensified in turn. The UAE is carving out a de-facto protectorate in the formerly independent state of South Yemen</p><p>The UAE already appears to be hedging its bets and preparing for the possibility of pivoting away from the Saudis if need be in spite of Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed (MBZ) being his Saudi counterpart Mohammed Bin Salman‘s (MBS) unofficial mentor. </p><p>It’s unclear how far this nascent rapprochement with Iran might go, but if the UAE continues moving in this direction in order to deter Saudi Arabia from stopping its plans for a de-facto protectorate in South Yemen, then it might set into motion a larger chain reaction of regional changes such as an improvement of the Emirates’ ties with Iran’s Qatari and Turkish partners, much to the Kingdom’s discontent.</p><p>Even if developments don’t move in that radical of a direction, it’s clear to see that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have gone from allies in the War on Yemen to frenemies who are strategically competing with one another in the larger Red Sea-Horn of Africa region.

What is sad and ironic is that the government, controlled by the Hadi ethnic group, and the coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - who control 80% of the territory - are not fighting for a more democratic government either.</p><p>One more issue, for a better understanding, the crisis in Yemen is not due to the 2011 uprisings. The reasons must be sought in numerous mistakes made by all Yemen political parties throughout history, and more precisely because of the mistakes and wars that took place under the government of former President Ali Abdulleah Saleh.</p><p><em>What has been the human cost of the conflict? Is the Yemen crisis the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today? Why?</em></p><p>The cost is a devastating life. This is the title of the 2018 Mwatatna annual report that shows part of the horrible violations against civilians and civil institutions committed by all parties to the conflict in Yemen. We chose this title because every aspect of life in Yemen is getting rough. The situation has completely collapsed. Yemenis are surrounded by death everywhere and are safe only by accident.</p><p>In addition to all direct violations suffered by Yemenis - such as airstrikes, land bombings, mines, detention, forced disappearance, torture, recruitment of children, attacks on schools and hospitals and much more -, Yemenis also face another kind of rape that is hunger. I name it as a rape because Yemenis are not starving, but they are starving them. The parties to the conflict are using hunger as a weapon of war. An important example of that is the issue of wages. Most public sector employees have not received their salary for years. This is really one of the things that structurally broke society and brought it to the brink of famine.</p><p><em>Are both parties really blocking humanitarian aid? What is the main purpose to prevent help from arriving?</em></p><p>We cannot affirm that there is only one cause. Mwatana has documented incidents of blockage, obstruction or impediment of humanitarian aid or critical assets to save lives for all parties to the conflict. In 2018, Mwatana documented 74 incidents of obstruction of humanitarian access and humanitarian supplies. The armed group Ansar Allah (Houthis) was responsible for 62 of these incidents. The "Popular Resistance" forces and forces loyal to President Hadi were responsible for 6 incidents, while the Saudi Arabia / UAE Coalition was responsible for another 6 incidents.</p><p>Although blocking, obstructing or preventing humanitarian aid or life-saving critical assets in Yemen has a particularly acute impact, but it is not the only reason that creates the worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen.</p><p><em>Do you consider this conflict as part of the regional power bid between Iran, ruled by Shiites, and Saudi Arabia, ruled by Sunnis? Is the Yemeni crisis in connection with tensions in the Persian Gulf?</em></p><p>It has nothing to do with the rivalry between Shites and Sunnis, it is a political war for power. The war in Yemen is increasingly complicated and more linked to the situation in the region, but it was not so from the beginning. If there is a real way for the international community to stop the war in Yemen, the country could stay away from these dangerous tensions.</p><p><span><a href="https://sintesismundial.wordpress.com/2019/08/18/yemen-no-tiene-por-que-ser-la-peor-crisis-humanitaria-del-mundo-incluso-si-la-guerra-continua/">https://sintesismundial.wordpress.com/2019/08/18/yemen-no-tiene-por-que-ser-la-peor-crisis-humanitaria-del-mundo-incluso-si-la-guerra-continua/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Long Range Attack On Saudi Oil Field Ends War On Yemen</p><p>Today Saudi Arabia finally lost the war on Yemen.

When UAE special forces began to <span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-saudi-uae-war-effort-in-yemen-part-1-operation-golden-arrow-in-aden">roll back</a></span> the Houthi rebel advance in Aden in April 2015, they were almost entirely alone</p><p>The second lesson is that U.S. counterterrorism operations are greatly aided by a capable regional partner who can act as a coordinating link between extraregional and local forces. </p><p>A third lesson is that foreign patrons must put in special effort and risk harming key relationships to prompt local auxiliary forces to meet international expectations on human rights and noncombatant immunity—and this might not be considered worth jeopardizing a strategic partnership. This was particularly evident in Aden, where the battle to liberate the city unleashed</p><p>A fourth lesson relates to the broader Gulf coalition, particularly to Saudi Arabia as a partner. </p><p>The UAE concluded, as one senior officer confided, that in Yemen they needed to “fix it or leave.” In the face of blanket international hostility, there was no completing the mission of liberating all the territories the Houthis seized in 2015, most importantly the vital Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Saleef. </p><p>This is the final lesson the UAE will learn in Yemen: Intervening powers are remembered as much for how and when they leave, and what they leave behind, as for what they did while they were present.</p><p>The military balance will shift back toward the Houthis, allowing them to hold Saudi Arabia in a deadlocked struggle in the north, while gradually reexpanding their influence in central Yemen.

This had two important side-effects. One was that it created a <em>de facto</em> north-south partitition of the country. The other was that by arming and training resistance forces in the south the Emiratis empowered the separatists.</p><p>This in turn has led to conflict between the separatists and supporters of the Hadi government. After being driven out of Sanaa – Yemen's official capital – Hadi claimed Aden as his temporary capital (though he actually spends most of his time in Saudi Arabia). The separatists, on the other hand, say Aden is theirs, not Hadi's. They also accuse the Hadi government of colluding with Sunni Islamist militants – inlcuding al-Qaeda and the Yemeni Islah party – who oppose the Houthis on religious grounds, since the Houthis follow the Zaidi strand of Shia Islam.</p><p>Tensions between the Hadi government and the separatists, and between the Saudis and Emiratis, <a href="https://al-bab.com/blog/2017/05/yemen-war-puts-strain-saudi-emirati-relations">are not new</a> but they came to a head after two separate attacks <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3021075/rebel-missile-and-suicide-attack-kill-least-51-yemen">killed dozens in Aden</a> on 1 August.</p><p>The separatists' basic claim is that they are better placed than anyone else to provide security in the south, and should be allowed to do so. But there is more to the security issue than security itself. If the separatists can establish control of security across the south and start to provide services for the public they will have the rudiments of a future state.</p><p>More immediately, control over security in the south would give the separatists significant leverage in discussions about the post-war shape of Yemen – a process from which they currently feel excluded. The problem at an international level, as the southerners see it, is that the Yemeni war is treated as a two-sided conflict – Houthis versus the "legitimate" government.</p><p> Ending the war is seen as more urgent than addressing the southerners' demands. Internationally, there is also little support for separatist movements. </p><p>In the meantime, though, continued international support for the Hadi government looks increasingly difficult to justify. </p><p>But what of the separatists' legitimacy? They appear to have plenty of local support though they have not been in a position to demonstrate it electorally. </p><p>In any eventual negotiations he envisages the south being represented by an inclusive delegation: "You need to bring in more people in order to strengthen your base." This would mean striking deals with tribal leaders and other dignitaries but he doesn't see them as part of the negotiating team. "The delegation needs to have specialised people for negotiating but we have to sign agreements with other figures, different components in society – we have to bring them all together so that the delegation represents all these people."</p><p>A further complication is that the southerners are seeking to create their state within the colonial borders established in the 1960s for the People's Democratic Republic. While war has divided Yemen, very roughly, along similar lines, the division between Houthi and non-Houthi areas doesn't precisely follow the boundary between the old northern and southern states – by Brian Whitaker</p><p><a href="https://www.al-bab.com/blog/2019/08/politics-separation-yemens-southerners-scent-opportunity-independence">https://www.al-bab.com/blog/2019/08/politics-separation-yemens-southerners-scent-opportunity-independence</a></p><p><strong>(** A B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Aden standoff delays Saudi summit intended to forge new Yemen government: sources</strong></p><p>The refusal of Yemeni southern separatists to hand back control of Aden port has delayed a summit in Saudi Arabia that is due to discuss reshuffling Yemen’s ousted government to include the separatists and end the stand-off, three Yemeni sources said.</p><p>Saudi Arabia called for the meeting after the separatist forces on Aug. 10 seized military camps and other state institutions in the southern port city, the temporary seat of the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.</p><p>“Forming a new government has been proposed and the alliance supports it, but inclusion of the Southern Transitional Council (STC) is linked to them fully withdrawing first,” said a Yemeni official, who declined to be named.</p><p>The official said Hadi, who has no personal power base and has long been out of favor with the United Arab Emirates, a coalition member, may be sidelined if a new deputy is named.</p><p>The coalition declined to comment on non-military matters.

This news has spread rapidly over the past several weeks, prompting many questions about what it could mean for the continuation or possible conclusion of the war in Yemen. However, the move will not affect the whole country equally. The UAE redeployment will mainly impact areas like Hodeida in northern Yemen. In South Yemen, by contrast, little or nothing will change on the ground because security is primarily provided by South Yemeni actors.

Ali Mohsen, a former ally of President Saleh. In recent weeks, reinforcements from Marib in central Yemen joined the Islah-aligned troops and were stationed in Shabwani oil fields, ultimately leading to military confrontation. On June 24, local residents demonstrated in Shabwa’s capital, Attaq, in support of the Shabwani Elite Forces and their role in maintaining local security, demanding military camps in Attaq be relocated outside the city and calling for an independent military unit for the governorate and an end to interventions by Islah-aligned troops.</p><p>The UN and the peace process</p><p>The UN special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, has frequently expressed <a href="https://osesgy.unmissions.org/briefing-un-special-envoy-secretary-general-yemen-open-session-un-security-council">concern</a>about the “re-escalating violence across Yemen,” but not that it has largely taken place in southern border areas like al-Dhalia and Shabwa. His silence raises concerns in the South about whether the UN is trying to conceal Yemen’s large North-South divide, which increasingly figures into this dynamic.

The UAE’s partial drawdown from Yemen forced Saudi Arabia to take full control over anti-Houthi military operations, and Abu Dhabi’s creation of a second theater of confrontation in Aden further undercuts Riyadh’s ambitions. In order to reset bilateral relations, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed met with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman in Mecca to discuss Yemen. After their meeting, both leaders vowed to combat common security threats in the Gulf region and resolve the crisis in Aden through political means. The STC’s refusal to withdraw from its freshly captured territories in Aden has dashed hopes for a swift Saudi-UAE rapprochement on Yemen, and the Arab coalition will likely remain fraught with internal discord for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The Houthis could benefit from increased Saudi-UAE tensions</p><p>Although the STC’s seizure of Aden is unlikely to result in the swift creation of an independent south Yemeni state modelled after the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), the STC’s actions will have lasting geopolitical reverberations. As tensions between the STC and Hadi’s government show few signs of ebbing, Iran and the Houthis could emerge as the unintended beneficiaries of the STC’s triumph in Aden. </p><p><span><a href="http://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/who-is-interested-in-south-yemen-independence/">http://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/who-is-interested-in-south-yemen-independence/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>What now for the Saudi-UAE alliance in Yemen?</p><p><span>What has happened in Aden?</span></p><p><span>Why does the new rift matter?</span></p><p><span>What will happen next?</span></p><p>Southern separatists in Yemen have seized control of the city of Aden, the temporary seat of the Saudi-backed Yemeni government, in an action that can fracture the alliance between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the country.</p><p>The UAE-backed southern separatists want to revert to a divided north and south Yemen, which existed before 1990 unification under then-president Ali Abdullah Saleh.

The UAE has all but taken control of Socotra, with UAE flags flying from government buildings in the island's capital of Hadibu. A sizable UAE force, in addition to a smaller contingent of Saudis, are reportedly on Socotra to secure the airport and seaport. The presence of Yemeni forces loyal to Hadi, as well as Saudi and UAE forces on Socotra, does not sit well with the presumptive sultan of the former Mahra Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra, abolished in 1967 when South Yemen's socialist government took over from the departing British. The former sultan and the Mahra General Council, over which he has influence, want a restoral of independence for the Mahra Sultanate. In this, the sultan is relying on old royal bonds to the Sultanate of Oman and the seven emirates that make up the UAE.

According to an <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-strikes-iran-in-iraq-secret-partner-iraq-silence-1.7615974">Israeli news report</a>, Israel launched the two attacks with U.S.-made F-35 jets.</p><p>Israel has long attacked Iranian-backed forces in Syria, an enemy of the United States. Now Israel has expanded its scope of operations to attack targets in Iraq, whose coalition government is friendly to the United States. The predictable result: the Iraqi government is bailing on Trump’s policy.</p><p>The dynamic exposes two underappreciated realities of Trump’s Iran obsession: Any U.S. war on Iran will ignite war in Iraq, and U.S. credibility is visibly faltering across the region. When things go wrong, a strategy can be rethought. An obsession can only ignore the warning signs.</p><p>The U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen that was supposed to check Iran’s power is now in disarray. The bloody war that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/trump-veto-yemen.html">Trump continued</a>, over the bipartisan congressional objections, has generated the world’s <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/02/1032811">worst humanitarian crisis</a>, and it is farther than ever from success.</p><p>The U.S.-backed Yemen war is losing allies, even among the Persian Gulf states that fear Iran.</p><p>In Europe, no government has joined Trump’s anti-Iran crusade (though John Bolton is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/11/politics/john-bolton-visiting-london-boris-johnson-prime-minister/index.html">whispering in the ear</a> of the new Trump-loving prime minister, Boris Johnson.)</p><p>When it comes to “maximum pressure,” the international reaction is: “include me out” — except in Israel, and therein lies the danger for the U.S. government and the American people. Israel has a vested interest in escalation, not de-escalation, with Iran.</p><p>Thanks to Trump’s policy, the incentives for Iraq to side with Iran are growing. No Iraqi government can afford to be seen making common cause with Israel. When Israel <a href="https://en.radiofarda.com/a/israel-joins-u-s--led-coalition-to-secure-navigation-in-persian-gulf-/30097422.html">announced</a> last week it would join a U.S. coalition to protect Persian Gulf maritime traffic, the pro-American government in Iraq spurned the idea. </p><p>The U.S. alliance with Israel comes with a high political price that Trump appears willing to pay. The secret attacks may enhance Israeli security; they also serve to isolate Washington from its Iraqi allies. </p><p>In short, the secret Israeli attacks increase the chances that any U.S.-Iran war will be fought in Iraq, where the U.S. intervention proved to be a disaster 15 years ago.

Zu diesem Schluss kommt ein Gutachten des Wissenschaftlichen Dienstes des Bundestages. (…)<br /> Die Untersuchung im Auftrag der Linken-Bundestagsfraktion kommt zu dem Schluss, dass die Durchsetzung von EU-Sanktionen nicht über internationalem Recht steht und somit auch die von der Bundesregierung getragene Begründung der britischen Regierung für die Festsetzung nicht rechtens war. „Maßnahmen auf der Grundlage des EU-Sanktionsregimes sind insofern nur statthaft, als sie auch mit den einschlägigen völkerrechtlichen Rahmenvorgaben vereinbar sind“, heißt es in dem Gutachten. Am Donnerstag hatten die Behörden von Gibraltar die Beschlagnahmung des Schiffes mit mehr als zwei Millionen Tonnen iranischen Rohöls aufgehoben. Die USA blockieren jedoch nach wie vor die Weiterfahrt des Tankers. Ein Bundesgericht ordnete die Beschlagnahme des Öls an.<br /> „Beide Akteure [EU und USA] können sich nicht auf eine Autorisierung ihrer Sanktionen durch eine externe, übergeordnete Ebene berufen. Der Vorwurf, letztlich eigene (nationale oder regionale) Interessen zu verfolgen, steht im Raum und unterminiert die Glaubwürdigkeit des Sanktionsregimes“, heißt es in dem Gutachten weiter. Großbritannien geht davon aus, dass das Rohöl für Syrien bestimmt war. Der Iran bestreitet das.

It was South Yemen, after all, that had a pro-Soviet Marxist regime from South Yemen’s independence from Britain in 1967 until its unification with North Yemen in 1990 at the end of the Cold War. Many from the older generation of the South Yemeni elite studied in the USSR, and contacts between them and Russia continued,” Mark Katz, Professor of Government and Politics at George Mason University, told Lobelog.</p><p>While Russia’s dominant status in southern Yemen faded after Yemen’s unification, that could be changing. </p><p>Throughout the Yemeni civil war, which erupted in March 2015 after the Saudi-led coalition launched a military campaign to crush the Houthi movement and restore Hadi’s government, Moscow has remained in the background, maintaining ties with all sides whilst refusing to explicitly support any party.</p><p>In the last year, Russia has shown increased concern for Yemen.

Looking ahead, however, the stagnation of Yemen’s peace process could change Russia’s policy toward the STC. </p><p>Although events in Aden could encourage Russia to establish closer relations with the Houthis and the STC, Moscow’s freedom of action is constrained by UN Security Council Resolution 2216. That resolution, which was adopted in April 2015, renders the Houthi occupation of Sanaa illegal and unequivocally supports a unified Yemen. </p><p>In spite of Russia’s public adherence to UNSC Resolution 2216, there are signs that Moscow could be willing to support the replacement of this resolution with a more inclusive framework. </p><p>Although Russia has treaded cautiously in the aftermath of the STC’s victory in Aden, the Houthis and the STC view Moscow as a potentially helpful partner in their efforts to gain international legitimacy – by Samuel Ramani</p><p><span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/08/russia-yemen-ksa-uae-houthis.html">https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/08/russia-yemen-ksa-uae-houthis.html</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Iran officially recognizes the Houthi government..

They're swarming around the world. Still. Again.</p><p>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the <span><a href="http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html">desert locust situation</a></span> is serious in Yemen and at the Indo-Pakistan border.</p><p>"One swarm covering one square kilometers contains 50 million locusts, and this swarm can eat the equivalent of 100 tons per day," said Wajeeh Mutawakel, the director general of the Plant Protection Office in the Houthi rebel-controlled Yemeni capital Sanaa, the <em>Middle East Eye</em> reported. "This may cause disaster not only in Yemen but also in other countries, such as in Saudi Arabia."</p><p>That's why scientists at Arizona State University have created the <span><a href="https://sustainability.asu.edu/global-locust-initiative/">Global Locust Initiative</a></span>. It seeks to "link partners and ideas and to avoid reinventing the wheel," says <span><a href="https://sustainability.asu.edu/global-locust-initiative/person/arianne-cease/">Arianne Cease</a></span>, director of the initiative. The idea is to get people information they need before a plague occurs.</p><p>The fact that human behavior might have contributed to the demise of the Rocky Mountain locust is intriguing.</p><p>"We're really interested in that connection between people and locusts," Cease says.</p><p>She says there is no single answer to controlling locusts. For a variety of practical and human health related reasons you can't just spray them into submission with pesticides. You need a multifaceted approach.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/08/19/752361368/maybe-the-way-to-control-locusts-is-by-growing-crops-they-dont-like">https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/08/19/752361368/maybe-the-way-to-control-locusts-is-by-growing-crops-they-dont-like</a></span></p><p>(A E)</p><p>Oil rises 2% after attack on Saudi field, stimulus expectations</p><p>Oil prices gained roughly 2% on Monday after a weekend attack on a Saudi oil facility by Yemen’s Houthi forces threatened crude supplies and as traders looked for signs that top economies would take measures to counteract a global slowdown.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-rises-2-after-attack-on-saudi-field-stimulus-expectations-idUSKCN1V9028">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-rises-2-after-attack-on-saudi-field-stimulus-expectations-idUSKCN1V9028</a></span></p><p>(* B D)</p><p><span>The street artist capturing the impact of the war in Yemen</span></p><p>Using stencils and spray paint, Murad Subay creates haunting figures, portraits and motifs</p><p>“Faces of War”, a project by Murad Subay, a Yemeni artist, seeks to draw attention to <span><a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/11/30/how-and-why-to-end-the-war-in-yemen">the worst humanitarian crisis in the world</a></span>.</p><p>Mr Subay’s works convey this desperation. </p><p>Mr Subay began painting when he was a teenager, though he has never been formally educated in it. He first gained attention in 2012 with “Colour The Walls of Your Street”, a campaign in which he invited friends, passers-by and strangers on social media to paint bright murals in areas of Sana’a that had been affected by conflict after the Yemeni uprising in 2011.</p><p>Mr Subay is pessimistic about the future. Halting the supply of weaponry is not going to end the war, he says. Even so, British politicians have sent “a terrible message worldwide that will encourage warring parties to carry on war crimes”. Nor is he convinced about the impact of his own work, despite winning an Art for Peace prize in 2014 for “spreading the culture of peace” and an Index on Censorship Award in 2016. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/08/19/the-street-artist-capturing-the-impact-of-the-war-in-yemen">https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/08/19/the-street-artist-capturing-the-impact-of-the-war-in-yemen</a></span></p><p>(A E K)</p><p>Oil prices climb after Saudi oilfield attack, but recession worries drag</p><p>Crude oil prices rose on Monday following a weekend attack on a Saudi oil facility by Yemeni separatists and as traders looked for any signs that Sino-U.S. trade tensions could ease.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-prices-climb-after-saudi-oilfield-attack-but-recession-worries-drag-idUSKCN1V9028">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-prices-climb-after-saudi-oilfield-attack-but-recession-worries-drag-idUSKCN1V9028</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vorige / Previous:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-566-yemen-war-mosaic-566/">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-566-yemen-war-mosaic-566/</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 1-566 / Yemen War Mosaic 1-566:</span></h2><p><span>https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose oder / or <a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Der saudische Luftkrieg im Bild / Saudi aerial war images:</span></h2><p><span>(18 +, Nichts für Sensible!) / (18 +; Graphic!)</span></p><p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/">http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://www.yemenwar.info/">http://www.yemenwar.info/</a> </span></p><p><span>und alle Liste aller Luftangriffe / and list of all air raids:</span></p><p><span><a href="http://yemendataproject.org/data/">http://yemendataproject.org/data/</a></span></p></div>
