Just one example, referring to the Saudi intervention in 2015: “In response to the Saudi intervention, Iran ramped up its support for the Houthis, thus transforming a domestic conflict into an international proxy war.” This really is putting upside down: It’s the Saudis and their western backers who intervened in Yemen and did this, not Iran.

However, a greater proportion of civilian casualties were children in 2019 than in 2018. A high child casualty toll accounted for 25% of the civilian casualties in 2019, up from 20% in 2018.</p><p>The number of civilian impact incidents remained high, seeing just a 6% decrease from 2018<br /> Although the number of civilian impact incidents and civilian casualties decreased compared to 2018, 2,213 incidents were still recorded in 2019, a drop of just 6% from the previous year, due to a series of escalations in Yemen, primarily during the first half of 2019.</p><p>The impact on civilians lessened in the latter half of the year, as a result of deals struck between parties<br /> The first six months saw the greater number of incidents, at an average of 215 per month, which slowed over the latter part of the year, dropping to 154, as a series of de-escalation agreements were struck between the warring parties.</p><p>The highest number of civilian casualties occurred when armed violence impacted civilian houses<br /> As with the previous year, the highest number of civilian casualties in 2019 occurred when armed violence impacted directly upon houses. Just over half (51%) of all civilian casualties as a direct result of armed violence in the past year were recorded within houses, a notable increase from 2018, when 40% of casualties were reported within homes</p><p>17% more civilian houses were impacted in 2019 than in 2018</p><p>Education facilities were the most frequently impacted type of infrastructure</p><p>Armed violence around the Red Sea Flour Mills restricted access to critical food infrastructure</p><p>Airstrikes in 2019 resulted in less than a third of the civilian casualties they caused in 2018</p><p>There was an increase in the number of civilian impact incidents caused by all other types of armed violence</p><p>Al-Hudaydah again saw the highest number of civilian casualties and civilian impact incidents</p><p>Rapid escalations in non-frontline areas resulted in a high civilian impact</p><p>Airstrikes were again the deadliest type of armed violence to impact on civilians in the Sana’a hub, resulting in several mass civilian casualty incidents during 2019<br /> On 1 September, airstrikes hit a prison in Dhamar, killing 156 people and injuring another 50. The incident was responsible for over half of the civilian fatalities reported across the Sana’a hub in 2019. Another airstrike incident was responsible for 77 civilian casualties in Sana’a city in May, and in April, a weapons cache exploded next to a school in the capital, having reportedly been hit by an airstrike, resulting in 110 civilian casualties, 52% of whom were children. Throughout the year, airstrikes were responsible for 438 civilian casualties across Sana’a hub, 67% out of a total of 652.</p><p>Fighting in residential neighbourhoods in Taiz city took a heavy toll on the civilian population<br /> Fierce fighting in residential neighbourhoods in Taiz city caused an 81% increase in civilian casualties, from 137 civilian casualties in the city in 2018, to 248 in 2019. The fighting also impacted on critical health infrastructure. 3 incidents impacted directly on the Ath Thawrah and Al-Mudhaffar hospitals, restricting access to healthcare for as many as 32,589 households. An MSF-supported hospital in Al-Mokha city on the west coast was also damaged in 2019, when a missile attack hit a nearby military camp.</p><p>Fighting on the Qa'atabah frontlines in Al-Dhale resulted in severe access constraints</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/civilian-impact-monitoring-project-2019-annual-report-1-january-31-december-2019">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/civilian-impact-monitoring-project-2019-annual-report-1-january-31-december-2019</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>How can Yemen's fragile health system combat coronavirus?</strong></p><p>At a cafe in Sanaa the night of Feb. 27, a pharmacist sat at a table waiting for his order.

He said, however, the cooperation between the Houthis and government is limited and indirect, as it is being conducted through a third party, namely the WHO.</p><p>A Yemeni photographer published an <a href="https://twitter.com/mohamd_alamery/status/1233371899876593664?s=19">image</a> on Twitter Feb. 28 of a medical team at the Houthi-controlled Ufar land crossing testing travelers onboard buses.</p><p>However, despite the Yemeni authorities’ — both Houthi and from the Saudi-backed government — assurances that coronavirus case has not been detected at the country’s ports, there have been concerns about the effectiveness of precautionary measures in a country where half of the population is vulnerable to such diseases.

Allowing the Houthis to secure all routes to the city. They also managed to capture the highway linking Marib and Al-Jawf provinces, which disrupted supply lines to Hadi’s ground forces.</p><p>The past month had witnessed intense battles in villages and towns surrounding Hazm as the coalition tried desperately to prevent the fall of the city through airstrikes and militia reinforcements from Marib. Nevertheless, in recent days the Houthi forces managed to <span><a href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2020/02/29/2213555/yemeni-troops-make-new-advances-encircle-jawf-capital">encircle</a></span> the city and led assaults from the north and south.</p><p>Crucially, this province is also home to the <span><a href="https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/al-jawf-oil-defies-arab-wealth-including-saudi-arabia-report/">most oil reserves</a></span> in the Arab world’s most impoverished country, yet Saudi Arabia has in effect prevented Yemen from exploiting its own resources for the past three decades, enabled through agreements made with the government of late, former <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20171205-profile-ali-abdullah-saleh-21-march-1942-4-december-2017/">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a></span>. Yemen has potential to be one of the leading oil producers and exporters in the Gulf region. It is no surprise then that they have fought so intensely to maintain control over Al-Jawf, most of which is now firmly in the hands of the Houthi-aligned <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20191214-its-time-for-the-international-community-to-stop-recognising-hadis-government/">National Salvation Government</a></span>.</p><p>The next target for the Houthis will be the neighbouring provincial capital of Marib, Marib city, which serves as a hotbed of the Islah Party militia forces who form much of Hadi’s infantry. Should this too fall to the Houthis, it would mean none of the north-western provincial capitals are under the control of coalition forces.</p><p>As it stands, the only advantage the Saudi-led coalition has, is air superiority and domination of the skies.

By capturing Hazm city, the Houthis can open a corridor allowing them to quickly send fighters from all over the north through al-Ruwaik desert to the Safer oil facility, enabling them to seize Marib’s oil and gas and take the city, the Yemeni government’s last stronghold.<a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/running-around-circles-how-saudi-arabia-losing-its-war-yemen-iran#_ftn2">[2]</a> This escalation marks a significant military development that could be a game changer in Yemen’s war. The Houthis’ military move is strategic.</p><p>Jawfis remain resentful of both the Yemeni government and the Houthis. In the mid-2000s, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh named Jawf along with Marib and Shabwa the axis of evil, accusing them of harboring terrorists. The province was prioritized in USAID’s 2010-12 Yemen country strategy as a result. Jawf tribes are largely perceived by urban Yemenis as violent thugs and bandits. Historically one of the most marginalized and neglected areas in Yemen, Jawf was deprived of basic services.<a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/running-around-circles-how-saudi-arabia-losing-its-war-yemen-iran#_ftn3">[3]</a> </p><p>“Saleh destroyed Jawf with three things: poverty, revenge killing, and ignorance,” said Hameed al-Ukaimi, whose brother was killed trying to stop the Houthi incursion into Jawf last month. His tribe, al-Shulan, has been fighting the Houthis since 2008 and has had a 40-year-old conflict with the Hamdan tribe.</p><p>Tribes were caught in the power struggle between Saleh and his political opponents, between the Houthis and Islah, and between the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition. Several rounds of fighting between the Houthis and local tribes took place between 2011 and 2014, during which hundreds of tribesmen were killed. Saleh supported the Houthis against local tribes to weaken the Islah Party, which had a strong influence in the province. </p><p>Jawfis and many Yemenis feel a deep sense of betrayal. During the war, Jawf and Marib emerged as two pockets of stability in the country, but the government and the Saudi-led coalition failed to protect them from the Houthis.</p><p>By 2018, Jawf had a functioning police force that successfully established security. For the first time in its history, Jawf had a court that solved around 1000 cases, most of which were about land.<a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/running-around-circles-how-saudi-arabia-losing-its-war-yemen-iran#_ftn8">[8]</a> Jawf also opened its first public university as well as a private university with unprecedented female enrollment of over 700 female students. The local authorities used local taxes to pay for salaries and administrative costs for the police, court, university, and health facilities among other services. </p><p>The Houthis’ military takeover of Jawf threatens to reverse these gains and is the reason why many tribesmen have picked up arms and fought to stop them.</p><p>The Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition failed to provide sufficient military support for local tribes to fend off the Houthis.</p><p>Incompetence, lack of unified leadership, and the absence of a military strategy by the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition played into the hands of the Houthis. </p><p>The Houthis’ military advance in Jawf is the result of a much deeper problem. Saudi Arabia entered the Yemen war with a stated objective of defeating the Houthis, but it did not have a strategy or an exit plan. The coalition’s response to the Houthi threat has been mostly reactive and lacked coherence. Saudi Arabia and the UAE had divergent agendas that have caused divisions within the different anti-Houthi forces, with the UAE supporting the Southern Transitional Council (STC) and the forces of Tareq Saleh against Hadi and Islah.

Secretary-General António Guterres, during which Pompeo will raise concerns about what he sees as the U.N.’s sluggish effort to freeze aid deliveries in the face of persistent Houthi obstruction and seizure of lifesaving relief, according to diplomatic sources.

The United States plans to freeze spending on a series of programs later this month, causing friction with other donor nations and NGOs that want to keep aid all supplies flowing, officials familiar with the matter say. The United States has not specified which programs it would stop funding, but a senior U.S. official told reporters there would be “exceptions for truly lifesaving programs,” including feeding sick children.</p><p>There are differences of opinion over how aggressively to cut off aid in Yemen, the site of the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, where some 80 percent of the country’s 28 million people depend on international aid and protection.</p><p>The U.N. recognizes the need to suspend specific aid operations, but only on a case-by-case basis, and only if they are convinced such assistance would violate established humanitarian standards that require aid be distributed strictly on the basis of need.

But in recent months some specific attempts have emerged to trace responsibility for war-related killings and suffering of thousands of civilians back to senior officials. It includes trying to go after European arms manufacturers.</p><p>The conflict in Yemen has been framed mainly in international media as a humanitarian issue, with intervention needed to prevent civilian starvation, as an unfortunate by-product of the war.</p><p>Two recent initiatives concerned with alleged war crimes in Yemen are of note. In the United Kingdom, a law firm has filed <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/02/uk-turkey-urged-arrest-uae-war-crimes-suspects-200212121428189.html">a complaint against UAE officials</a>. It will be up to the courts to decide if indeed there is sufficient evidence to arrest political and military heads if they visit London, Washington or Ankara.</p><p>Meanwhile in The Hague, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) is trying for a prosecution at the International Criminal Court (ICC) of the heads of European arms manufacturers.</p><p>The ICC route is tortuous because as a treaty organisation, unless the United Nations Security Council steps in, only crimes in member states and those committed by their nationals can come under its aegis. Many of the “article 15 declarations” – when NGOs and lawyers send communications to ask the court to investigate – turn into nothing because of these geographically tight restrictions.</p><p>At the end of last year, the ECCHR along with several partner organizations – Mwatana for Human Rights from Yemen, and other international groups – tried to find a way around the simple fact that neither Yemen nor Saudi Arabia nor UAE are members of the court. They are calling on the ICC to investigate whether European arms companies and European government ministers and officials, through authorizing and exporting arms, to the military coalition led by Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, have committed war crimes.</p><p>This is a “new avenue” says Miriam Saage-Maaß, <a href="http://mailings.ecchr.eu/c/44146848/0dc8732a5cab-q19l2t">head of ECCHR’s Business and Human Rights program</a>. I</p><p>LESSONS FROM NUREMBERG</p><p>Since this is a war characterised by massive bombing campaigns, they have targeted “companies involved in the production of Eurofighter Typhoon military aircrafts, the Tornado and Mirage aircraft, and refueling planes, as well as the subsequent exports of spare parts and maintenance to keep these aircrafts operational during the course of the conflict”. Specifically: Airbus Defence and Space S.A. (Spain), Airbus Defene and Space GmbH (Germany), BAE Systems Plc. (UK), Leonardo S.p.A. (Italy), and Dassault Aviation S.A. (France).</p><p>“If you are providing the means for warfare and potentially also for the commission of war crimes, could that not be framed as aiding and abetting, as giving assistance to the main perpetrator of the crime?” asks Saage-Maaß. “Then the question [for aiding and abetting] is: what is a substantial contribution to those crimes?”</p><p>To answer that they have looked beyond ICC jurisprudence, back, for example, to the Nuremberg trials.</p><p>BEFORE THE ICC, A HIGH BURDEN OF PROOF</p><p>Saage-Maaß sees parallels with current heads of European arms companies: “They are in the business of selling arms. And that means they a lot of times have very close ties to the governments they're selling the arms too. And they are actually well informed about all the conflicts ongoing in this world. If you're doing business with the Congo for 25 years, obviously you know what's going on there. But they just don't consider it their responsibility to care. I think that's something we really want to change.”</p><p>A COMPLEX CHOICE FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION</p><p>If the ICC wants to be credible, argues Saage-Maaß, and if those countries that are supported the court want to be credible, “they must be willing to apply the standards of the International Criminal Court also to citizens of their countries. There cannot be double standards in international criminal law. So, you know, you may go after the war criminals all over the world, but you must be also looking at the responsibility of Western actors.” – by Janet H.

source in Sana'a revealed that there is an Emirati-American agreement to establish American bases southern Yemen, including Hadramout governorate to replace the UAE bases.</p><p>Since the Americans know that their presence in the province will be rejected by the people of the province, it was necessary to find a justification for this presence, and for the people of the province to accept this presence. For decades, the pursuit of terrorist organizations has been America's excuse for its presence in the areas it occupies. By deluding the landowners of the existence of a common enemy, "terrorism", which requires the necessity of an American presence to confront it.</p><p>It seems that this scenario is what the Americans are currently applying to Hadramout governorate in eastern Yemen, which has witnessed since the end of November last year, significant movements from the American side, and successive visits by the US ambassador, Christopher Henzel.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels resumed attacking Saudi Arabia while the Saudi-led coalition is increasing its military pressure on the rebels.</p><p>The Houthis are moving closer to Iran, and Tehran is relying more on them to keep its Arab adversaries on their toes, particularly after other Iranian proxies are facing popular protest in Iraq and Lebanon.</p><p>A London-based Gulf expert notes that, “As Iran is being more squeezed, it directs its reaction to softer targets, as they know they can’t fight America despite their patriotic rhetoric.” He concluded that, “using Houthis in Yemen against Saudi Arabia might be cheaper for Iran while costing Gulf countries billions.”</p><p>There’s almost agreement that the defining factor in pacifying the region, and not only Yemen, is American involvement. But it’s an election year in the United States, where domestic issues prevail on the agenda of all politicians, including Trump. Washington also knows that there are no electioneering gains from ventures in Yemen.</p><p>In a blog post for the Brookings Institution, Bruce Riedel from the Centre for Middle East Policy wrote about US reluctance to get involved. Yet he indicated that the Trump administration’s support for the Saudi position is not changing, though Riyadh is frustrated by what it regards as Washington taking a step back when it comes to the Saudi-Iranian struggle. His conclusion was that America sees the war in Yemen as part of the “maximum pressure” strategy on Iran, without getting involved militarily.</p><p>In January, a US drone strike killed Qassim Al-Rimi, leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen. The escalation of fighting is an opportunity for terrorists, like AQAP and the Islamic State group to resurge in the war-torn country. The inclusion of the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Islah Party in the internationally recognised government is another catalyst for that resurgence. So, American involvement — at least in fighting terrorism — in Yemen will probably continue.</p><p><span><a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/50/1203/364632/AlAhram-Weekly/World/Yemen-back-on-the-burner.aspx">http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/50/1203/364632/AlAhram-Weekly/World/Yemen-back-on-the-burner.aspx</a></span></p><p>(* B K P)</p><p><span>The Saudi regime using the strategy of divide and rule in Yemen</span></p><p>The Saudi regime adopts a “divide and rule” strategy in Yemen in an effort to perpetuate its criminal war on the country and its continued influence and military intervention in favor of its ambitions to expand.</p><p>The Saudi regime plays to stoke Yemeni conflicts to ensure continuity of its interventions and implementation of its projects and to leave Yemen weak and divided, and it is not in its interest to keep Yemen strong.</p><p>The Saudi coalition turned into a real enemy of the Yemenis, as they saw the coalition expelling thousands of Yemenis abroad and weighing them in fines, prisons, deportation, and Saudization at a time that undermined the Yemeni economy and disrupted the country’s facilities.</p><p>The Yemenis show with indignation and anger the support of the Saudi coalition and its allies in the Emirates for the Yemeni officials and parties against each other and fueling their differences after it was the cradle of the Houthi coup years ago in Sanaa.</p><p>Yemenis complain that the Saudi coalition supports all Yemeni parties against each other and the separatist Transitional Council is against the legitimate and legitimate government against the transitional, as well as supporting the militias of the Belt against the National Army and vice versa, so as to devote a fragmented divisive divide that eats one another.</p><p>It is clear from this that the Saudi regime seeks to establish a formal state empty of any real democratic life, so the regime does not stand with any step to unify the Republican ranks and the return of partisan political life in Yemen.</p><p>The Saudi regime appears comfortable with the state of division within the forces supporting legitimacy in Yemen, as this rupture makes it more maneuverable, so that everyone races to offer their service offers to him to gain confidence until the system remains a guardian of all.</p><p>Yemeni officials affirm that Saudi and the Emirates are the actual obstacle to uniting the Republican ranks in Yemen, and fueling the differences between its parties.

In most cases they have been the ones carrying the burden of providing for their families”, said Nestor Owumohangi, <span><a href="https://www.unfpa.org/">UNFPA</a></span> Representative in Yemen. </p><p>Conflict escalation and the ensuing humanitarian crises have further weakened the position of women and girls in Yemeni society, says UNFPA. The result has been the near erosion of protection mechanisms for women, increasing their risk of abuse and violence. </p><p>UNFPA mobile protection and reproductive health teams have been deployed to provide critical maternal health services, psychological first aid and transit kits, identifying the most vulnerable women and girls and referring them to relevant services. </p><p>Losing access to education </p><p>With limited shelter options, displaced women and girls tend to suffer most from lack of safe spaces and limited access to basic services. Notably, displaced girls are more likely to lose access to schooling as families with limited resources deprioritize their education. An estimated 48% of Yemini women are illiterate and child marriage continues to be a common practice. </p><p>UNFPA is working to empower women and girls through safe spaces and mobile clinics in affected regions. By providing access to reproductive health services and psychosocial support, women receive life-saving assistance, whether they are displaced, on the move or caught in the frontlines of conflict. </p><p>“Since the war started, health providers have not been receiving salaries,” explained Dr. Afrah Thabet, a Yemeni obstetrician stationed with UNFPA in the country. “We keep training them to provide minimum services for reproductive health. With the current situation in the country, we are trying our best to make sure that women are able to access commodities, medications and maternal health services they urgently require.”</p><p>Safe spaces foster a sense of security and solidarity, allowing for the identification and support of survivors of gender-based violence while mobilizing and empowering women such as Hana’a psychosocially and professionally. For survivors of gender-based violence, livelihood and skills training provides an entry point for services, eliminating stigma and facilitating community outreach. </p><p>UNFPA supports 46 women and girls safe spaces across the country, two of which are in Marib and one in Al Jawf. Visits to these spaces have increased by 50 per cent in the past month. </p><p>To reach women and families in need, UNFPA takes a number of customized approaches. In remote villages, mobile teams provide in-home services, including maternal health, family planning services and psychosocial support to women and girls who cannot afford to pay for transportation to hospitals. </p><p>To date, the mobile teams have assisted over 5,500 individuals with reproductive health and protection services in Marib and Al Jawf following increased displacement. </p><p>“As much as food and shelter is essential, what determines women’s life or death in a crisis is their ability to access basic reproductive health and protection services on time,” explained Mr. Owumohangi. “Our greatest success has been in making sure that these unique needs of women and girls have not been overlooked in the world’s largest humanitarian crisis that is happening in Yemen.” </p><p><span><a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1058591">https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1058591</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span>Landmines and unexploded ordnances mean Yemenis are in danger.

We do hope that the parties to the conflict go back to the political track… and that the efforts of the UN special envoy yield fruit to basically to bring a peaceful end to this carnage and to this war in Yemen".</p><p>Touma also added that almost every child in Yemen now needs humanitarian assistance, with the number of children requiring aid reaching some 11 million. She noted that the situation in Yemen is especially dire for children because the current conflict in the country comes on the heels of decades of economic stagnation and poverty.</p><p>"All I would say is it could have been much, much, much worse if the UN was not on the ground delivering assistance to kids, the families, to old men, to old women, to men and women in general. The situation is quite desperate. It's really unacceptable that we have children dying of hunger in the 21st century”, she said. “It is time for the guns to go silent in Yemen , for Yemen to be able to get back on its feet, for Yemen to rebuild bit by bit for the sake of children in Yemen”.</p><p><span><a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/202003041078466891-unicef-urgently-needs-64mln-for-humanitarian-aid-in-yemen---regional-spokesperson/">https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/202003041078466891-unicef-urgently-needs-64mln-for-humanitarian-aid-in-yemen---regional-spokesperson/</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Charity for Yemen “Food and Medicine”</span></p><p>I’m sure you have read that charities, Non Government Organizations (NGO’S), especially UN based, are on the ground in Yemen.

Heavy fighting, including artillery shelling, was reportedly ongoing by late afternoon on 2 March, mainly in the outskirts of Al Hazm District. Airstrikes have also been reported in various districts in Al Jawf. Initial field reports indicate massive displacement from Al Hazm District, which has been hosting thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Marib and other districts of Al Jawf Governorate to Marib Governorate.</p><p>HUMANITARIAN IMPACT AND NEEDS</p><p>As of 2 March, the overall civilian casualty figures and number of displaced persons was unclear due to continued fighting in the affected. However, an estimated 1,800 families reportedly fled heavily populated districts of AlGhayl and Al-Hazm districts in Al Jawf as fighting escalated in these areas on 1 March. Executive Unit for IDPs in Marib reported that 2,100 displaced families reached Marib on 1 March and are hosted by local communities in Marib City and Alwadi District. Local civil society leaders informed OCHA of several IDP families stranded in Al Rwaik desert on their way to Marib. In Al Khalq district of Al Jawf, 650 families are reportedly displaced, and assistance is ongoing despite extreme difficulties due to the volatile security situation. IDP Executive Units of Al Jawf and Marib reported that displaced families will be hosted in Al Mil IDP site, due to lack of capacity to host within Marib City, security concerns as well as challenges to track IDPs if they scatter across the whole governorate. Al Mil site has a hosting capacity of 1,440 households, but local authorities indicated that it can be expanded further to accommodate more displaced people.</p><p>HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-al-jawf-and-marib-flash-update-no1-3-march-2020">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-al-jawf-and-marib-flash-update-no1-3-march-2020</a></span></p><p>Comment: <span>Figures of newly displaced and IDPs are far more than what <a href="https://twitter.com/OCHAYemen">@OCHAYemen</a></span> <span>reported.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/Ibrahim4Yemen/status/1234911215169810433">https://twitter.com/Ibrahim4Yemen/status/1234911215169810433</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>IOM Yemen | Displacement in Marib | 27 February 2020</p><p>SITUATION OVERVIEW</p><p>An escalation of conflict activities in late January 2020 has since forced 3,370 households to flee frontline areas in Sana’a, Al Jawf and Marib governorates to safer areas in Al Jawf and Marib governorates.
