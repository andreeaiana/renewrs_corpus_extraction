The strategy of economic warfare doesn’t change the military equation, but has devastating effect on civilians. A visit to a country scarred by famine, disease and neglect</p><p>The situation is bound to get worse. In the coming weeks, food rations will be further diminished for 12 million people, while 2.5 million malnourished children will be excluded from primary services. At the end of October, drinking water programs will be closed and 19 million people will lose access to medical assistance, including one million women who depend on the United Nations for reproductive health.</p><p>In essence, Yemen, the most serious humanitarian crisis in the world, according to the UN, risks becoming a country where families consist of eight, ten, or thirteen starving children all under the age of five.

Lise Grande, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen for the United Nations, described the situation with very harsh words. “All of us are ashamed by the situation. It’s heart-breaking to look families in the eyes and say we have no money to help.”</p><p>At a conference in Yemen last February, the UN and other humanitarian actors working in the country were promised 2.6 billion USD to meet the urgent needs of over 20 million people. To date, less than half of the amount has been received. “We are fighting cholera, diphtheria. The war has revived diseases that had disappeared years ago. Diphtheria is highly contagious, and families do not have money for the fuel needed to get to medical centres,” continues Dr. Abdullah Aji in Sana'a hospital. “In normal conditions, a vaccine would be enough to contain the epidemics. But everything is missing here. The blockade prevents the entry of medical specialists and essential supplies.”</p><p>Since the beginning of the war in 2015, the Saudi-led coalition has imposed a naval and air blockade in the north of the country, preventing access to primary goods.</p><p>The road to the north, leading to the border with Saudi Arabia, towards the Houthi stronghold in the city of Saada, crosses remote spaces, valleys, mountain villages, and rural areas with refugee camps scattered between mountains and deserts, that are often without electricity and water. Here the huts are built with leaves and mud. Almost all of the displaced people in the Khamir camp come from Saada, which since 2015 has been consistently bombed by the coalition as a military target. Being the home base of the Houthis, the whole city has been considered a target, including civilians and those seeking to escape.</p><p>The war has produced endemic unemployment, the disappearance of millions of jobs, and the collapse of the currency. The Saudi-led coalition has employed a strategy of surrounding and starving out areas. This is most apparent in the port city of Hodeida, a critical point for the provision of humanitarian aid and other necessities and therefore the centre of a fierce battle.</p><p>According to a study by the London School of Economic (LSE) on the effects of the war on agriculture in the early years of conflict, agricultural crops and farmlands were frequently hit in areas like Shabwa and Mahwait, close to the road that leads to Sana'a, a crucial route of transport coalition forces are trying to take control over.</p><p>Reports have shown that the Saudi-led coalition strategy seeks to destroy food production in Houthi-controlled areas. This strategy of economic warfare, damaging agriculture and controlling food imports, is aiming to besiege and starve the population. This hypothesis was confirmed at the beginning of September by the group of experts established by the United Nations Human Rights Council in a report that denounces war crimes committed by the parties in the Yemeni conflict.</p><p>UN experts write that the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition that supports it on the one hand, and the Houthi rebels on the other, have been using indiscriminate air strikes, torture and sexual violence for years, in addition to blocking humanitarian aid and resorting to hunger as a constant method of warfare.</p><p>This strategy has been perpetrated for years and has caused the collapse of the Yemeni Rial and a steep rise in inflation. This led to the rapid depletion of foreign exchange reserves and therefore major cuts in spending by the Central Bank of Yemen, as underlined in the report of the World Peace Foundation at the beginning of September.</p><p>The victims are exposed in the unprecedented, scandalous violence of their visible skeletons. The Yemeni war sees no solutions, rather it sees the fragmentation of alliances, the emergence new actors in the field, and the call of new demands. The regional powers roll the dice, each following their own agendas amid the humanitarian tragedy that serves as a fertile environment for radicalization – By <span>Francesca Mannocchi</span> (with photos)</p><p><span><a href="https://magazine.zenith.me/en/society/war-and-famine-yemen">https://magazine.zenith.me/en/society/war-and-famine-yemen</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Houthis Vow Retaliation As Saudi Naval Blockade Sparks Fresh Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen</strong></p><p>Saudi Arabia has stepped up its seizure and detention of ships carrying food and fuel into Yemen, sparking shortages that experts warn will push the country’s civilians into even more dire straits.</p><p>Recent political developments have offered a glimmer of hope to some that the end of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen may be near. But a <span><a href="https://www.ye.undp.org/content/yemen/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2019/prolonged-conflict-would-make-yemen-the-poorest-country-in-the-w.html">new report</a></span> by the United Nations Development Programme shows that a recent tightening of the Saudi-led Coalition’s blockade against the country, and the fuel shortages it has sparked, not only are exacerbating Yemen’s humanitarian crisis but also are slated to make Yemen the world’s poorest country by 2022.</p><p>In the nursery at the Maternity and Childhood Hospital in Amran, doctors and families alike fear that fuel shortages will lead to power cuts, plunging the ward into darkness and rendering its life-saving machines inoperable. One mother in the ward diligently watches a heater placed near her infant, knowing that it the electricity-powered medical device stops, her child will die.</p><p>Dr. Hadi Al-Hamzi, the director-general of the hospital, said that 30 infants could die if their incubators stop for just two hours. He added, “We have a severe shortage of generator fuel, and we have no prospect of getting more in the coming days.” Mohammed Mujahed, the director of Amran Governorate’s Health Office, warned that intensive care for pregnant mothers and nurseries in the province could be stopped in a matter of hours if no generator fuel is secured.</p><p>The Saudi-led Coalition has stepped up its seizure and detention of ships carrying food and fuel into Yemen and the effects of those seizures are already being felt by ordinary people. Thousands of Yemenis already facing acute food shortages could die, as stocks of stored food dwindle and cannot be replenished. Sultana Begum, a representative of the Norwegian Refugee Council humanitarian organization, <span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-economy-fuel/lines-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see-new-fuel-shortage-hits-yemen-idUSKBN1WE0BF">told Reuters that</a></span> “fuel shortages in Yemen exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation in the country and lead to unacceptable levels of suffering.”</p><p>For 40 days, the Coalition, led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has continued to hold 13 ships loaded with oil derivatives at sea, preventing them from entering the port of Hodeida. The UN has already inspected and licensed the ships in compliance with a decision issued by the Saudi-backed Hadi government that requires customs duties to be paid in Aden before ships can discharge in Hodeida. </p><p>As in other regions, in Sana’a lines as far as the eye can see have become a common sight, as people queue at gas stations hoping to secure fuel. Government-imposed rationing has been enforced and only 40 liters (about 10 gallons) of fuel are allowed per vehicle every six days. Many gas stations have already been forced to close as a result of the shortages, and black-market fuel now costs three times the official price. </p><p>Garbage trucks have not been able to operate either, leaving enormous piles of uncollected rubbish littering major cities, including Sana’a, a city already struggling to cope with cholera amid a doubling of its population since the war began. </p><p>Fuel and food and health</p><p>The impact of the Saudi-led sea blockade has already reached Yemen’s hospitals. Dr. al-Mutwakil, the minister of health based in Sana’a, said operations and intensive care departments in a number of hospitals are about to close owing to the shortage of oil derivatives and the prevention of their access to Hodeida port.</p><p>Ministry spokesman Dr. Yousef al-Hadhri said in a statement that more than 120 hospitals, 3,000 health centers, private hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and blood banks are at risk of “catastrophe” if the Coalition continues to prevent the arrival of oil derivatives.</p><p>Aside from its acute effects on Yemen’s hospitals, the fuel shortage is causing a public health crisis, as spikes in cholera and other waterborne diseases are expected on account of the inability of water filtration systems to operate and trucks to deliver safe drinking water, as well as desalination plants that are unable to operate without fuel.</p><p>Fuel is needed not only to power the generators that have been the sole source of electricity for hospitals since a widespread blackout hit in 2015, but also for transportation. Shortages have caused fuel prices to spike up to 200 percent in some areas, making the transportation of life-saving aid to communities-in-need more expensive. Deliveries that used to take one day now take three days, as trucks have to wait for fuel, resulting in major delays in getting food and medicine to the most vulnerable communities – by Ahmed Abdulkareem</p><p><span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/yemen-retaliation-saudi-naval-blockade-humanitarian-crisis/262285/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/yemen-retaliation-saudi-naval-blockade-humanitarian-crisis/262285/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Treibstoffblockade im Jemen legt die Krankenhäuser lahm</strong></p><p>Die Blockade lebensnotwendiger Hilfsgüter durch die saudisch geführte Koalition hat katastrophale Folgen insbesondere für den Gesundheitssektor.</p><p>Während die Mainstream-Medien nur damit beschäftigt sind, Präsident Trump zu verurteilen, weil er US-Truppen aus Syrien abzieht, steht der Jemen vor einer nationalen Gesundheitskrise. In mehreren Großstädten im Jemen werden die letzten funktionierenden Krankenhäuser ihre Türen schließen und keine Dienstleistungen mehr für Patienten erbringen. Geopolitics Alert sprach mit dem Sprecher des jemenitischen Gesundheitsministeriums, Dr. Jusuf Al-Haidari, um die Auswirkungen dieser Krise zu diskutieren.</p><p>Stellen Sie sich vor, wie die Gesellschaft in den Vereinigten Staaten zum Stillstand käme, wenn eines Tages die Tankstellen einfach trocken lägen. Die Leute könnten nicht zur Arbeit fahren. Familien könnten kein Essen kochen. Die Häuser hätten kein heißes Wasser zum Reinigen oder Baden.</p><p>Für ein Land, das wie der Jemen belagert wird, bedeutet der Triebstoffmangel auch, daß Krankenhäuser geschlossen werden müssen. Die meisten Krankenhäuser haben ihre Arbeitszeiten reduziert, und die anderen bereiten sich darauf vor, vollständig zu schließen.</p><p>„Es gibt Hunderttausende von Patienten, wenn nicht Millionen, die schnell oder langsam sterben werden, sie werden unter Schmerzen sterben. Wer wird Millionen von Jemeniten, die Transport benötigen, um die Krankenhäuser zu erreichen, mit Benzin versorgen? Wer wird die 6000 Patienten mit Nierenversagen zweimal pro Woche zum Gesundheitszentrum bringen? Wer wird den Privatsektor, der Behandlungsdienste für etwa 60% der Bevölkerung erbringt, mit Kraftstoff versorgen?“, sagte der Sprecher des Gesundheitsministeriums, Dr. Jusuf Al-Haidari, gegenüber Geopolitics Alert.</p><p>Die ärmsten Gemeinden in den ländlichen Gebieten des Jemen, wie Hodeidah, sind am stärksten gefährdet, da sie sich den Transport zu funktionierenden Krankenhäusern in Sanaa in fünf Stunden Entfernung nicht leisten können.</p><p>Krankenhäuser schließen im Jemen – und die Medien schweigen</p><p>Dr. Al-Haidari erklärte, daß in einem Land mit wenig Gesundheitsinfrastruktur nur 50% des Gesundheitssektors in Betrieb sind, während sich die Zahl der Menschen, die nach der Aggression und Belagerung Gesundheitsdienste benötigen, verfünffacht hat.</p><p>Praktisch betroffen von der aktuellen Krise sind:</p><p>Krankheiten als Waffe</p><p>Die saudische Koalition hat nicht nur ihre Aggression fortgesetzt, sondern auch die Schlinge um die Katastrophenhilfe und Gesundheitsversorgung des Jemen weiter zugezogen, um die verletzlichsten Zivilisten im Jemen umzubringen. Krebspatienten, Nierenpatienten, Schwangere, Kinder und ältere Menschen sind mit den schlimmsten Folgen konfrontiert.</p><p>Viele Menschen wissen vielleicht nicht, wie sich der Kraftstoffmangel und die Blockade auf alle Aspekte der jemenitischen Gesundheitsversorgung auswirken.</p><p>95% der Medizinprodukte in staatlichen jemenitischen Krankenhäusern haben ihr Haltbarkeitsdatum überschritten, aber Ärzte müssen mit ihnen arbeiten, weil es keine Alternative gibt. Patienten mit chronischen Krankheiten wie Diabetes (500.000 Patienten), Herzerkrankungen, Nierenversagen (6000), Nierentransplantationen (3000), Krebs (60.000) und anderen chronischen Krankheiten haben aufgrund der hohen Preise auf dem kommerziellen Markt keinen Zugang zu ihren Medikamenten. Der Staat ist aufgrund der Blockade nicht in der Lage, eine kostenlose oder erschwingliche Alternative anzubieten.</p><p>Wie der Sprecher des Gesundheitsministeriums Al-Haidari sagte, sterben jeden Tag Dutzende von Menschen am fehlenden Zugang zu lebenswichtigen Medikamenten.</p><p>Aufgrund der Zerstörung der jemenitischen Infrastruktur, wie der Wasserversorgung oder der Abwasserentsorgung, breiten sich im Jemen Epidemien wieder aus, die seit Jahrzehnten verschwunden waren. Im Zuge der Cholera-Epidemie wurden bis zum 5. Oktober 2019 2.099.531 Menschen infiziert.</p><p>Erinnern Sie sich an die Welle der Berichterstattung über das sogenannte „letzte Krankenhaus in Aleppo“? Es überrascht nicht, daß von diesen Journalisten weit und breit keiner zu finden ist, wenn jetzt das jemenitische Gesundheitssystem aufgrund der illegitimen Aktionen von Washington, Riad und Abu Dhabi zusammenbricht.</p><p>Eine einfache Google-Suche zeigt im Gegenteil, daß beworbene Artikel, die von Medien der saudischen Koalition stammen, im Gegenteil saudische „Hilfe“ für den Jemen loben – von Randi Nord</p><p><span><a href="https://www.solidaritaet.com/neuesol/2019/42/jemen.htm">https://www.solidaritaet.com/neuesol/2019/42/jemen.htm</a></span></p><p>The original English version already had been published Oct. 7: <span><a href="https://geopoliticsalert.com/yemen-fuel-hospitals-close">https://geopoliticsalert.com/yemen-fuel-hospitals-close</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Divisions restrict Southern Transitional Council, UAE ambitions in Yemen</strong></p><p>Yemen’s <span><a href="http://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/5/11/governor-turned-president-adens-al-zubaidi-announces-council-to-govern-south-yemen">Southern Transitional Council</a></span> emerging as a dominant force in the south has shifted the country’s political dynamics. The faction faces opposition not just from President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi’s government but within the southern movement itself.</p><p>Though it presents itself as the legitimate <span><a href="http://en.stcaden.com/news/8470">representative of southern Yemen</a></span>, Nabil al-Boukiri, an independent Yemen affairs analyst, told Al-Monitor that the Security Belt is entirely funded and trained by the UAE, which seeks a friendly independent southern state to control the port city of Aden.</p><p>The STC shares the UAE’s hatred of the Islamist al-Islah party in Yemen. The UAE has used the Security Belt to occupy the south, most recently moving to <a href="http://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/uae-backed-forces-seize-security-hq-in-yemens-socotra/1602602">occupy the island</a> of <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/09/yemen-socotra-island-south-uae-saudi-influence.html">Socotra</a> on Oct. 4.</p><p>Fernando Carvajal, a former member of the UN Security Council Panel of Experts, told Al-Monitor that despite some divisions within the organization, “there are no overt conflicts. The leadership has so far done a good job keeping Salafi elements and tribal loyalists united for now.” He added, “The STC and Security Belt Forces are interdependent. The weakening of one will weaken the other, financially or with regard to popular support.”</p><p>Yet while the UAE-backed factions have maintained a degree of cohesion, other southern movements threaten their agenda with diverging aims. Some seek full governorate autonomy, while others back the federal project or oppose the STC’s representation of the southern movement.</p><p>“The divisions are among the other southern components of the movement, such as the Baum faction and the South National Council faction supporting the federal project of Yemen and other southern components,” said Boukiri.</p><p>Since the STC's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-aden-government/yemen-government-says-southern-separatists-staged-coup-in-aden-idUSKCN1V00KA">coup attempt</a> on Aden Aug. 10, such differing visions for southern Yemen have threatened to trigger disputes and conflict in the event the STC gains further control of the south. </p><p>External factors trigger further divisions across the southern political landscape.</p><p>“Mahra is the biggest challenge for the STC because of the role played by Oman. Local tribes don’t want conflict, so they maintain limited representation within the local STC group, while still retaining ties to Oman,” said Carvajal. He explained they are playing a balancing act between both sides, as <a href="http://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2019/6/18/geopolitical-competition-fractures-yemens-al-mahra-province">Oman</a> traditionally wielded strong influence over Mahra's elites.</p><p>“Parts of the Abyan Hirak [movement] have yet to align with the STC because they still have hope for Hadi, who is from Abyan. Part of Hirak in Shabwa is funded by Hadi through his strongest allies, also preventing STC monopoly over Hirak in this oil-rich province,” he added.</p><p>These parts of the southern movement in Abyan and Shabwa that are independent from the STC originate from the original Hirak formed in 2007</p><p>There are currently <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/south-yemen-separatists-190919074008631.html">dozens of southern movements</a></span> operating outside the STC’s command. Yet due to the extensive UAE support for the STC and its secessionist militias, it is still the dominant southern faction.</p><p>Loud calls for governorate autonomy come from within Hadramawt, as <a href="http://ctc.usma.edu/can-uae-security-forces-avoid-wrong-turn-yemen/">Hadrami elites displaced</a> by those working with the UAE fight to reclaim their lost influence.</p><p>Independent Yemeni researcher Fuad Rajeh told Al-Monitor that divisions across Yemen's southern governorates could give rise to further demands for independence.</p><p>“Oil-rich Hadramawt, which has a land area of more than 193,000 square kilometers, would seek autonomy,” said Rajeh. “Its leadership has been warning the STC against any moves.

This has led certain groups of the Yemeni citizens accumulate catalogue of grievances, therefore, justify their opposition against the state. Not only the internal drivers, but, and without doubt, since the creation of the modern Yemeni state, it has been a laboratory of external initiatives and multiple interventions that complicated the situation and shaped the Yemen’s state political dynamics. This prepared the state to pass through political, social, and economic turmoil which broke the hope and aspiration of the citizens. This study argues that the genesis, drivers, and actors of the Yemeni conflict are varied from one to another, yet the major drivers of the conflict are local, but the roles of external actors who persistently engaged in the conflict for political reasons remain apparent. It dismisses that the external actors, both from the region and beyond will bring peace and stability to Yemen.

Even before the conflict, rural areas holding 75% of the national population had only 23% energy access rates. The ongoing conflict has made the situation dramatically worse, it is estimated that the access to electricity had dropped to below 10 percent due to extensive damage to the national grid and fuel shortage across the country. In general, energy supply in Yemen for many years has been very limited due to weak generation capacity, limited access, high electricity losses from the grid, and increasing demand. Energy access in Yemen has been heavily dependent on local diesel generators to meet the needs of social services, businesses, as well as irrigation pumping needs of farmers.</p><p>The collapse of electricity combined with price and the severe shortage of fuel needed to operate social services, businesses and household generators (for those who can afford them) has restricted most people access to basic social services such as healthcare, water supply, education, as well as lighting and the ability to power home electric appliances. Yemen is therefore left with the option of solar systems, serving better-off households, farmers, small to medium-sized enterprises; however, it is still used in smallscale.</p><p>UNDP realized that there is a need to have an operational guideline that will support solar programming in other agencies, private sector, and local communities.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.ye.undp.org/content/yemen/en/home/library/solar-energy-programming-operational-guideline.html">https://www.ye.undp.org/content/yemen/en/home/library/solar-energy-programming-operational-guideline.html</a></span> = <span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/solar-energy-programming-operational-guideline">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/solar-energy-programming-operational-guideline</a></span></p><p>(B H)</p><p>WHO and the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation working together to fight malnutrition in Yemen</p><p>WHO and the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) are working together to fight malnutrition in Yemen.

The “back-channel” negotiations began after the Iran-aligned Houthis announced on September 20 that they would cease drone and missile attacks on the kingdom, people briefed on the talks said.</p><p>A western diplomat said the missile and drone attacks on the Saudi oil facilities were key to the shift in Riyadh’s position. “If the Yemen war hadn’t existed, Iran wouldn’t have been able to distract away from its responsibility for the attacks,” the diplomat said. Another factor behind Riyadh’s shift has been the weakening of its coalition after the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia’s main ally, announced in July that it was drawing down its troop presence in Yemen, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>After the Houthis said they would halt missile and drone attacks into the kingdom, Riyadh agreed to halt its bombing raids over four Houthi-held cities, including Sana’a, the capital. The Houthis, meanwhile, have released nearly 300 prisoners, including three Saudis. These are seen as confidence-building measures, and discussions are going on over other initiatives, such as lifting a coalition blockade on fuel imports to the Houthi-controlled north through Hodeidah port and allowing the rebels to use Sana’a airport. This could begin with so-called mercy flights to allow the sick and wounded to leave for medical treatment. One person briefed on talks said this week the coalition agreed that four tankers waiting off Hodeidah would be able to enter the port. Another person said there had been positive indications on the lifting of the fuel blockade but nothing had been finalised. “It’s very fragile but I think both sides have an interest in it working,” the diplomat said. “It’s not peace in Yemen, we are possibly talking about end of daily bombardments across the country and missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, while the UN tries to move on with a political agreement.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0e924804-ec31-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061">https://www.ft.com/content/0e924804-ec31-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061</a></span></p><p><span>(* A K P)</span></p><p>UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths is working on a comprehensive settlement between Saudi Arabia and the al Houthi movement following an al Houthi ceasefire offer, according to Al Jazeera.

In Yemen, a war pitting the Houthis, until not long ago a relatively unexceptional rebel group, against a debilitated central government in the region’s poorest nation, one whose prior internal conflicts barely caught the world’s notice, has become a focal point for the Iranian-Saudi rivalry. It has also become a possible trigger for deeper U.S. military involvement.</p><p>There is a principal explanation for such risks. The Middle East has become the world’s most polarized region and, paradoxically, its most integrated. That combination—along with weak state structures, powerful nonstate actors, and multiple transitions occurring almost simultaneously—also makes the Middle East the world’s most volatile region.</p><p>ACT LOCALLY, THINK REGIONALLY</p><p>The story of the contemporary Middle East is one of a succession of rifts, each new one sitting atop its precursors, some taking momentary precedence over others, none ever truly or fully resolved. Today, the three most important rifts—between Israel and its foes, between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and between competing Sunni blocs—intersect in dangerous and potentially explosive ways.</p><p>Together with the region’s polarization is a lack of effective communication, which makes things ever more perilous.</p><p>Yet in so many other ways, the Middle East functions as a unified space. Ideologies and movements spread across borders: in times past, Arabism and Nasserism; today, political Islam and jihadism.</p><p>Accordingly, local struggles quickly take on regional significance—and thus attract weapons, money, and political support from the outside. </p><p>STATES OF CHAOS</p><p>Along with the Middle East’s polarization and integration, its dysfunctional state structures present another risk factor. Some states are more akin to nonstate actors: the central governments in Libya, Syria, and Yemen lack control over large swaths of their territories and populations. Conversely, several nonstate actors operate as virtual states, including Hamas, the Houthis, the Kurds, and the Islamic State before it was toppled. </p><p>Weak states cohabiting with powerful nonstate actors creates the ideal circumstances for external interference. It’s a two-way street—foreign states exploit armed groups to advance their interests, and armed groups turn to foreign states to promote their own causes.</p><p>Washington became a central player in a regional and international game that it purportedly wanted nothing to do with. </p><p>A similar scene has played out in Yemen. Since 2004, the north of the country had been the arena of recurring armed conflict between the Houthis and the central government.</p><p>Washington, still in the midst of negotiations over a nuclear deal with Tehran, which Riyadh vehemently opposed, felt it could not afford to add another crisis to the brittle relations with its Gulf ally.</p><p>Despite its misgivings about the war, Washington thus threw its weight behind the Saudi-led coalition, sharing intelligence, providing weapons, and offering diplomatic support. As in Syria, the Obama administration looked to limit U.S. aims. It would help defend Saudi territorial integrity but not join Riyadh’s anti-Houthi fight or get sucked into an Iranian-Saudi battle. As in Syria, this effort largely was in vain. The United States could not cherry-pick one part of the war: if it was with Saudi Arabia, that meant it was against the Houthis, which meant it would be against Iran.</p><p>With such ongoing risks, the debate about the extent to which the United States should distance itself from the region and reduce its military footprint is important but somewhat beside the point. Should any of these scenarios unfold, the United States would almost certainly find itself dragged in, whether or not it had made the strategic choice of withdrawing from the Middle East.</p><p>The more consequential question, therefore, is what kind of Middle East the United States will remain engaged in or disengaged from – by Robert Malley</p><p><span><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2019-10-02/unwanted-wars">https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2019-10-02/unwanted-wars</a></span></p><p>My comment: This is quite interesting, but rated only *, as: the author tires to whitewash the US here.

In September, Yemen’s Houthi rebels released footage showing captured Canadian-made light armoured vehicles, indicating clearly that the armoured vehicles exported to Saudi Arabia through Trudeau’s approval of a Harper-era deal are being used in this bloody war. The Liberal government was forced to launch a review of the arms contract after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia in 2018.

But to what extent are the Houthis able to target them?</p><p>The sophistication, precision, and range (Abqaiq being 1,150 kilometres north of Yemen) of the September 14 attacks far exceed anything the Houthis have done before. Iran, however, is known to have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-houthis/yemen-houthi-drones-missiles-defy-years-of-saudi-air-strikes-idUSKBN1W22F4">supplying and training</a> the Houthis in using and managing drones. They operate primarily the Qasef-1 attack drone, which is identical to the Iranian Ababil-2/T, and can deliver a 45kg warhead up to 150 kilometres. </p><p>Analysts have counted 58 Houthi <a href="https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/08/analysis-houthi-drone-strikes-in-saudi-arabia-and-yemen.php">drone strikes</a> on Saudi Arabia, of which most targeted airports in nearby Abha, Najran and Jizan. But drone strikes on an airport in Abu Dhabi in July 2018 and on the East-West pipeline in May 2019 (over 800 kilometres away) show an upgrade in sophistication and range. In late 2018, the <a href="https://undocs.org/en/S/2019/83">UN found</a> the use of a new drone they named ‘UAV-X’ (which may be what the Houthis refer to as ‘Samad-2/3’), conceivably able to carry an 18 kg warhead with shrapnel up to 1,500 kilometres.</p><p>Saudi officials have also reported 200 ballistic <a href="https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/08/analysis-houthi-missiles-against-the-saudi-led-coalition.php">missile attacks</a>, but the exact number is likely to be significantly higher. The Houthis are provided with crucial components from Iran to build missiles, according to a <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/letter-dated-26-january-2018-panel-experts-yemen-mandated-security-council-resolution">UN report</a>. Iran also provides <a href="https://ctc.usma.edu/houthi-war-machine-guerrilla-war-state-capture/">advisers</a> that assist in construction and tactics.</p><p>Revenues from the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/207.html#SA">Saudi oil industry</a> accounts for 87% of budget revenues, 42% of GDP, and 90% of export earnings – this puts into perspective how sensitive Saudi Arabia is to disruptions in oil flows. A fact not lost on the Houthis. High-impact attacks, like the ones on Abqaiq and Khurais, are highly unlikely to become a regular event. </p><p>However, it is highly likely that the Houthis will increasingly execute low-impact attacks on critical Saudi oil infrastructure. Saudi Arabia can compensate for disruption inflows as it holds a lot of oil in store, and has a lot of spare capacity in pipelines and stabilisation plants. But a large number of low-impact attacks would cause significant damage over the medium to long-term as cost of repairs and defences accumulate. It would also challenge Saudi Arabia’s credibility as a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3027517/drone-strikes-saudi-arabia-may-push-china-diversify-oil-supply">reliable oil supplier</a>, and its role as a <a href="https://www.oilandgasmiddleeast.com/drilling-production/35035-saudi-oil-production-outage-could-test-us-as-swing-producer">swing producer</a>.</p><p><span><a href="https://globalriskinsights.com/2019/10/houthi-threat-to-saudi-arabias-oil-industry/">https://globalriskinsights.com/2019/10/houthi-threat-to-saudi-arabias-oil-industry/</a></span></p><p><span>(A K pS)</span></p><p>Houthi-laid mines removed from newly liberated areas of al-Dhale</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/13518">http://en.adenpress.news/news/13518</a></span></p><p><span>(A K pS)</span></p><p>Dozens Houthi militants incl. leaders killed in Sa’ada</p><p><span><a href="http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/10/14/dozens-houthi-militants-incl-leaders-killed-in-saada/">http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/10/14/dozens-houthi-militants-incl-leaders-killed-in-saada/</a></span></p><p>(* A K pS)</p><p>A Houthi booby-trapped boat attacks the port of Midi, injuring a TV reporter and a number of soldiers</p><p>On Saturday evening, a Houthi booby-trapped boat attacked the port of Midi in Hajjah province in northwestern Yemen, injuring a television reporter and a number of members of government forces present at the port.</p><p>A military source told Al-Masdar Online that a booby-trapped boat attacked the port and exploded the moment it arrived.</p><p>According to the source, the government forces were unable to deal with the boat because it was not aware of its presence until it was located at a close distance from the port.</p><p>According to the Al-Masdar online correspondent, the explosion of the booby-trapped boat caused shrapnel injuries among the soldiers who were near the scene of the explosion, and Mohammed al-Khaiwani, a correspondent for "Balqis" television, was injured in the explosion, where he was hit in the face by shrapnel.</p><p>While the military source said that the explosion did not result in deaths, he said that the injured were nine, and the injuries were light.</p><p><span><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/172664">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/172664</a></span></p><p>and</p><p>(A P)</p><p>The Yemeni Journalists Syndicate condemns the targeting of Balqis correspondent in Midi (photo)</p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/NabilAlosaidi/status/1183472594542047233">https://twitter.com/NabilAlosaidi/status/1183472594542047233</a></span></p><p>(A K pH)</p><p>Oct. 12: In Sa'ada, Saudi missiles and artillery shells targeted different areas of Razih district.</p><p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=9259">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=9259</a></span></p><p>(A K pH)</p><p>Two Children Injured by Saudi-mercenaries’ Fire in Al-Dhalae</p><p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=9265">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=9265</a></span></p><p>and also <span><a href="https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/fires-of-aggressions-mercenaries-hit-two-displaced-children-in-al-dhale/">https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/fires-of-aggressions-mercenaries-hit-two-displaced-children-in-al-dhale/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K pS)</span></p><p><span>Iran und Houthis wollen den Jemen in das Vietnam der Saudis verwandeln</span></p><p>Dem Iran nahestehenden Fernsehsender veröffentlichten Videos, in denen saudische Soldaten gedemütigt wurden und die nicht zufällig an den Vietnamkrieg erinnern.</p><p>„Von houthi- und iranfreundlichen Medien veröffentlichte Videos, scheinen Hunderte von saudi-arabischen Kämpfern zu zeigen, die von den Houthi-Rebellen im Jemen besiegt wurden.

In recent years, some typhoons have hit and caused serious damage, especially to some coastal areas.</p><p>Typhoons are a symptom of ongoing climate change and indeed in Socotra, as everywhere, average temperatures are rising and there are long periods of drought. Then there is the breeding: the goats have significantly increased in number and are left free to graze on the island. Result: they also feed on endemic species, which thus no longer reproduce and Dracena itself is at risk. To this is added a, albeit still limited, deforestation and the presence of alien species in the numerous watercourses; and then the overfishing of marine resources, also due to fishing boats coming from other nations; the increase in the population, from 42 thousand inhabitants in 2004 to current ones, estimated at 60 thousand or even 80 thousand. And to make matters worse, pollution due to plastic. And so we will have a picture perhaps not even complete of the situation. The UNESCO, taking note of all this, has launched an <span><a href="http://unescosicilia.it/wp/2019/10/02/">appeal for the preservation of the island</a></span> and has launched a campaign to make it known by the title "<span><a href="http://www.socotrainsicilia.it/campagna-unesco-connect-2-socotra/">Connect2Socotra".</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://altreconomia.it/socotra-guerra-yemen/">https://altreconomia.it/socotra-guerra-yemen/</a></span></p><p>(-)</p><p>Film: <span>And the talented </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/Mohammed_Farid0">@Mohammed_Farid0</a></span><span> lights our Friday with a new song.
