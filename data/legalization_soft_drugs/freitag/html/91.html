In reality the conflict is complex and multi-factional. It is also predominantly domestic in origin and nature. State-sponsored disinformation and misinformation about the conflict is rife, compounding the effect of the wider world’s lack of familiarity with a small and no longer important country.</p><p>While the spark for the conflict came from the Arab Spring and the attempted counter-revolution which followed, many of the underlying factors which fuel the war are the unfinished elements of previous conflicts. Further, as with most enduring situations, there have been splits, re-alignments and hardenings of positions on ‘both’ sides. A survey of the protagonists can reveal much about the conflict, and how it will play out.</p><p>Sa’udi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have led a slowly reducing coalition of peripheral Arab states backed by American, British and French military, intelligence and industrial assets.</p><p>In the Northern Highlands, Ansar Allah, led by the sharifal Huthi family, are Zaydi revivalists. The sharifal family seeks to redress discrimination against the former sharifal aristocracy under the post-1960s Republic, while the wider movement seeks to re-empower the North’s predominantly agrarian Zaydi community. Under the Republic the latter lost influence vis-à-vis the more mercantile Shafa’i Sunnis of the South and felt besieged after the Sa’udis started, in the 1990s, sponsoring propagation of Salafism.</p><p>Overlaid on this religious tension is a less overt push for rebalancing from Bakil, one of the two main Zaydi tribal confederations. Bakil, having been more Royalist during the 1960s civil war, feels that it has lost ground to the more Republican Hashid confederation.</p><p>The Arab Spring brought to the surface splits within the then ruling (predominantly Hashid) regime. President Ali Abdallah Salih tried to transition to a jumlukiyya (hereditary republic), breaking the pact which had brought him to power. The General People’s Congress (GPC) party – never an ideological formation – split along factional lines. Despite having fought six wars against Ali Abdallah Salih, the Huthis aligned with his faction of the GPC against Hadi, Ali Muhsin and the 10 brothers of the al-Ahmar family (the paramount shaikhs of Hashid), who are also leaders of al-Islah, the Yemeni Muslim Brotherhood affiliate. The al-Ahmars themselves had tried to capture Sana’a in 2011, but were fought to a standstill; they subsequently decamped, and fight alongside Hadi.</p><p>In the South, the anti-Huthi factions – anti-conservatives, Southern separatists, GPC-Aden and others – aligned to Hadi, who was ‘elected’ to the Presidency in February 2012. But Hadi has little personal support outside his Abyan homeland.</p><p>In addition to the Hadi-aligned groupings, Transnational Jihadis, such as al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula, and Islamic State, found sanctuary among the broken terrain and neglected tribes of the South.</p><p>Thanks to the lavish and indiscriminate provision of money and materiel, new actors have since had the wherewithal to emerge, predominantly in the South on the anti-Huthi side. Most vocal has been the Southern Transitional Council (STC), UAE-backed secessionists. The UAE has also set up, trained and paid several semi-autonomous forces in the South, to create “security belts”.</p><p>Also enabled by Coalition’s largesse, the Sunni tribes of the Tihama have mobilised as Tihamis for the first time since Sayf al-Islam Ahmad broke their power in 1928/29. </p><p>Finally, the Mahris, long the recipients of Omani soft-power, have seen their territory occupied by Emirati and then Sa’udi forces. Fuelling their discontent have been rumours that the Sa’udis intend to establish a Salafi madrassa in Mahra and to create a Sa’udi land corridor to the Indian Ocean, dividing Mahra from the rest of Yemen – by <em>James Spencer</em></p><p><a href="https://lobelog.com/politics-by-other-means-yemeni-style/">https://lobelog.com/politics-by-other-means-yemeni-style/</a></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>THE ANGRY ARAB: The Saudi Crown Prince’s Crippled Agenda</strong></p><p>From launching a war on Yemen to having Jamal Khashoggi murdered, As’ad AbuKhalil sizes up the magnitude of MbS’s miscalculations.</p><p>As soon as MbS became defense minister, he launched the war on Yemen. He calculated that the war would only last a few weeks and that the Huthis would quickly surrender. (The Obama administration presumably found this credible, since it lent support to the adventure, probably as a compensation for the U.S.-Iran agreement, which the Saudis vigorously opposed.)</p><p>And, while the war was launched in the name of weakening Iranian hold in the region, it has actually cemented ties between the Huthis and the Iranian regime and its allies in the region.</p><p>This calculation backfired on other fronts as well. The assault on Yemen brought international media scrutiny to his atrocious war crimes there, while repressions inside the kingdom have been exposed in the wake of the horrific killing and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi. </p><p>Khashoggi’s slaying became a permanent stigma for MbS. With the exception of his brief appearance at the G-7 summit in France a few weeks ago, he has not visited the U.S. or the West since.</p><p>Confronting Iran</p><p>MbS’s miscalculations have extended to his entire confrontation with Iran in the region. Last year he kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon</p><p>Furthermore, MbS was hoping — along with MbZ of the United Arab Emirates [Mohammed bin Zayed, crown prince of Abu Dhabi] — that Donald Trump would be the U.S. president they had been waiting for: the one who would launch a devastating war on Iran to end Teheran’s influence in the Middle East once and for all.</p><p>In the first few years of the Trump administration Saudi regime media were full of scathing attacks on former President Barack Obama</p><p>Change of Mind</p><p>MbS seems to have now changed his mind about the desirability of war with Iran. What Iran has done in recent months (assuming it was responsible for the various attacks on shipping in the Gulf and on the oil installations in Saudi Arabia), is to demonstrate to Saudi Arabia and the UAE not only the reach of its bombing capability, but its determination to extend the war to the Arab Gulf countries if Iran is attacked by Israel or the U.S. This can explain the recent Saudi and Emirati overtures to the Iranian regime. Both are suddenly expressing concern over the cost of war, if it were to erupt in their region. </p><p>Limited Choices</p><p>Bin Salman’s economic promises have also failed to bear fruit for the Saudi population. He may now be facing rising resentment within the royal family itself</p><p>MbS has limited choices. He can’t afford to antagonize Trump and nor can he influence Trump one way or another regarding U.S. policies toward Iran. </p><p>His best hope is that war does not take place, and that Khashoggi will be forgotten. That is very unlikely given the recent publicity surrounding the first anniversary of the killing. A man who made arrogance a key part of his personality, has been humiliated by Khashoggi, a former member of the Saudi royal entourage.</p><p>But then again, Western governments have short memories when it comes to war crimes, assassinations and human rights violations by despots who are loyal to Western agendas. Any rehabilitation that MbS can work out will require him to sacrifice much of his original agenda. It will mean curtailing his appetite for war in Yemen and elsewhere and to drop his plans to confront Iran on all fronts. The recent crippling of oil installations responsible for more than 50 percent of Saudi oil production had the effect of also crippling the foreign policy agenda of Mohammed bin Salman. – By As’ad AbuKhalil</p><p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2019/10/07/the-angry-arab-the-saudi-crown-princes-crippled-agenda/">https://consortiumnews.com/2019/10/07/the-angry-arab-the-saudi-crown-princes-crippled-agenda/</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2><p>(*A H)</p><p>Medical sources for "Al-Masdar Online": 28 cases of cholera epidemic recorded in "Salah al-Din" west of Aden</p><p>Cholera cases west of the southern city of Aden have been on the rise since last week.</p><p>A medical source and local residents told Al-Masdar Online that about 28 citizens of Salah al-Din area of al-Buraiqa district, west of the southern city of Aden.</p><p><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/172383">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/172383</a></p><p>(A H)</p><p>Dengue outbreak in Aden University student residence</p><p>On Saturday, a university student died of dengue fever, while other students were confirmed to have infected in the recent outbreak inside a university dormitory in Khormaksar district, east of Aden, in the south of the country.</p><p><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/172341">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/172341</a></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><span>(* A H)</span></p><p>Rainwater proliferates dengue fever in Aden</p><p>The stagnant pools of rainwater has increased dengue fever proliferation among the populations of Aden, local sources and health officials said.</p><p>The lack of rainwater drainage system has led the stagnant fresh water to mix with the open sewage wastewater on streets and propagated several endemic diseases particularly the dengue fever.</p><p>So far, the dengue fever claimed one life and other five suspected cases were reported being infected with the same epidemic, local health official said.</p><p><a href="https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-33577">https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-33577</a></p><p>(* B H)</p><p>What Yemen Moms can do to save baby from Cholera.</p><p><a href="https://rinj.org/rsac/">The RINJ Foundation</a> nurses have been asking families in Yemen to adhere to some specific sanitation, food-preparation, and hygiene procedures, even if no family member is ill, to ensure that families stay healthy.

What is the reality of the situation in the city where the Houthis and the government are exchanging the charge of besieging it</p><p>Al-Durhimi is a besieged city in the coastal province of Hodeidah since late last year, according to the Houthis, while the government's version of the Legitimate government says that the pro-Iranian group is using the civilian population of the directorate as hostages and repeatedly preventing the entry of food and humanitarian aid into Citizens.</p><p>The two stories have been frequently echoed in the past few months, through the media. </p><p>The Houthis are demanding the lifting of the siege imposed by government forces on the residents of Drihmi, the latter denying this, and say that militias are holding residents of the remote directorate.</p><p>What is the real story of the Drihmi that the parties to the conflict are trying to hide?</p><p>The report of the Council of Human Rights's eminent expert group noted that they were investigating "allegations that parts of the Drihmi Directorate have been under siege."</p><p>The report reviewed a series of events coupled with time, and in early August 2018, the Yemeni armed forces and their Armed groups, supported by the United Arab Emirates, advanced towards the outskirts of the central directorate. After periods of heavy fighting that destroyed many buildings, the Houthis maintained control of most of the directorate, including the center. The front lines were settled at access points to the Directorate's center, which is under the control of pro-coalition armed formations. the presence of landmines has made it more difficult to reach the area."</p><p>The Group of Experts stated that "between August and December 2018, while heavy fighting was continuing, humanitarian agencies were never able to reach the Directorate."</p><p>In June, WFP spokesman Erve Versell announced that for the first time they would be able to distribute food aid in two areas near the front lines of fighting in Sana'a and Hodeidah provinces.</p><p>The program, in collaboration with The Islamic Relief Organization, was able to distribute food in kind to 896 families living near the front lines in Nehm district in eastern Sana'a province, Said Ferrousel at a press conference in Geneva.</p><p>According to the food programme, aid has been delivered to the besieged city of Al-Drihimi in Hodeidah province for two months, in addition to water, hygiene kits, by UNICEF and UNFPA groups.</p><p>The latest report of prominent experts presented to the Human Rights Council at the end of September said that no humanitarian assessment has been carried out in Drihimi since June 2018,</p><p>The report reiterated the restrictions on aid access and access to the population in two parts,</p><p>The report, which reviewed by Al-Masdar online, added that parts of the area of "Al- Drihimi " under the control of the de facto authorities, including the directorate's center, suffer from severe restrictions on humanitarian access.</p><p>According to information obtained by the experts, they believe that both government forces and their loyalists are violating humanitarian and international law by the siege of Al- Drihimi, and that Houthi militias violate international and humanitarian law by planting anti-vehicle and individual mines, The Houthis deny planting individual mines, but experts say they are cultivating them in places frequented only by civilians.</p><p>The report pointed to other conclusions regarding the prevention of access to organizations and assistance, as the Houthi group continues to restrict aid access and sometimes change course, the report said.</p><p>The report, which reviewed by Al-Masdar online, added that parts of the area of "Al- Drihimi " under the control of the de facto authorities, including the directorate's center, suffer from severe restrictions on humanitarian access.</p><p>According to the report, the control of access points by the Yemeni armed forces and UAE-backed affiliate groups is one of the reasons why aid cannot arrive, while mines laid by the Houthis are other reasons for blocking aid access."</p><p>"The exact number of people still living in the Houthi-controlled areas of Al-Drihimi directorate remains unknown, also because humanitarian actors are not able to make an independent assessment of needs," the report continued.</p><p>The report spoke of reliable estimates of the number of people trapped in Drihim.</p><p>As hundreds of Drihimi residents struggle to survive, they face a blockade, aggression and a war led by all sides without regard to the lives of civilians, whose numbers are increasing, and all sides are playing the beat of these figures in media and political bidding.</p><p><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/172357">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/172357</a></p><p><span>(A K pH)</span></p><p>US-Saudi Aggression’s Daily Update for Sunday, October 6th, 2019</p><p><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=9158">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=9158</a></p><p><span>(A K pH)</span></p><p>US-Saudi Aggression Destroys Truck in Ras Issa Port</p><p>A US-Saudi airstrike destroyed a truck in Al-Erj area in Al-Salif district, Hodiedah.

As Foreign Policy stated, they are largely inexperienced with a limited track record, leaving them unprepared for the current conflict in Yemen, which appears to serve as “military practice” for the Saudis.</p><p>The “rag-tag” rebel Houthis for their part are still highly tribal orientated; indeed, the Zaydi movement is named after the prominent Al-Houthi family which founded the “AnsarAllah” in the northern province of Saada.</p><p>As the Houthis have carried out their own aerial attacks on Saudi Arabian territory – including the audacious drone and missile strike on the Aramco oil facilities attributed to them — and have recently increased their cross-border raids against Saudi forces – most notably with the contested claims of having captured thousands of Saudi troops and mercenaries in addition to seizing munitions, territory and overrunning military bases in Najran province — it would be interesting to see how irregular, tribal warriors from the Arab world’s poorest nation pitted against the wealthiest kingdom in the region fit into Ibn Khaldun’s theory of the decline of the state.</p><p>I would go as far as to contend that the province of Najran represents the weakest link for Saudi state security; not only has the province witnessed numerous Houthi raids, but the loyalty of the province’s subjects is also suspect, given its modern history. Najran, along with the Saudi provinces of Asir, Jizan and Al-Baha were historically territories of Greater Yemen</p><p>In my article on the Zaydi community of Yemen, I concluded that there is perhaps an opportunity for revolutionary ideas to cross the border between the increasingly Iranian influenced Houthis and the local residents of Najran, who Human Rights Watch describe as “second class Saudi citizens”.</p><p>The oil facilities and their lack of defence capabilities, as we have seen, also illustrate weaknesses in the kingdom. It may be the reason why Saudi air strikes have decreased significantly over the past few days, following a truce initiative by the Houthis, with veiled threats for continued responses to the strikes.</p><p>Although Saudi Arabia is not an empire, the fall of Rome in the 5th century offers many insightful parallels with the current state of the kingdom, chief among them being the reliance on disloyal “barbarian” mercenaries to protect their borders against the “barbarian hordes”; a declining economy; and higher taxation. Roman society became indolent and comfortable and adopted and promoted a form of Christianity which was intolerant to other cultures and religions. Sound familiar?

Has AnsarAllah’s strategy changed from defensive to offensive?</em><br /> Ansar Allah’s recent operation with effective results took place while Ansar Allah’s military structure after a period of difficult situation due to severe battles, now has reached the stage to take offensive steps.<br /> Ansar Allah’s military strength in drone, missile, air defense, etc. were very primitive in compared with Saudi coalition equipment and the war was managed using weapons left from Ali Abdullah Saleh era. However in the last 2 years we see a significant development in Ansar Allah’s capabilities. Recent operations of Ansar Allah, such as attacking Aramco, are complicated ones.<br /> Considering Ansar Allah’s situation and strength, operation ‘Nasr Min Allah<strong>‘</strong> is considered a large size operation but does not solve the war in Yemen alone. To have better result in the war Ansar Allah should operate more similar to this operation and north of Dhale operation.</p><p><a href="https://www.english.iswnews.com/7514/answering-key-questions-about-yemen-war-part-five/">https://www.english.iswnews.com/7514/answering-key-questions-about-yemen-war-part-five/</a></p><p>My remark.

Those calculations are horrifically wrong, but the United States has neither the moral nor political power to force other countries to be good. It can, however, choose not to be complicit. By refusing to do so, Trump has made the United States a co-belligerent in the Yemen war.</p><p><span>This war could not be waged at anything near its present level without our direct and daily support.</span></p><p><span>President Trump favors the Saudis mainly because they promise to spend billions of dollars buying American weapons, and does not seem to care how they use those weapons. His principal advisers, however, have a different motive. They care little about Saudi Arabia and even less about Yemen. To them, this war has a larger purpose. It is part of their hydra-headed campaign against the Middle Eastern country they most detest: Iran. They see Iran as a great sinner because it resists American power. The group that Saudi planes are bombing in Yemen, the Houthis, has Iran’s sympathy, so Trump’s advisers see killing Houthis as a way to hurt Iran.</span></p><p>Expressions of outrage over the recent drone attack on a Saudi oil refinery reflect this lopsided logic.</p><p>The Houthis claimed responsibility. But since Iran is friendly to the Houthis, we blame everything they do on Iran.

They were also seen as a challenge to the United States by Iran since Washington is Riyadh’s principal ally and Saudi Arabia’s premier security prop.

Recent credible reports assert that the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, has approached the Pakistani and Iraqi prime ministers to act as go-betweens to set up direct high-level talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran in order to reduce tensions between them and, consequently, the threat to Saudi security from Iran.</p><p>Given America’s demonstrated reluctance to come to the aid of Saudi Arabia in case of a confrontation with Iran, the Saudi rulers seem to have calculated that it is in their interest to find accommodation with Tehran before the strategic situation becomes more disadvantageous for them. </p><p>Where does this leave the American policy of exercising “maximum pressure” on Iran to force the latter to completely renounce its plans for uranium enrichment, discontinue its ballistic missiles program, and stop its support to proxies and allies in the Middle East, such as Hezbollah and the Assad regime, which Washington perceives as being antagonistic to its strategic goals in the region? Saudi Arabia has been the kingpin of American strategy toward Iran. Any loosening of Washington’s ties with Riyadh is bound to redound to Tehran’s benefit.

By the end of 2019, it is estimated that the cumulative contraction in real GDP would reach approximately 45%, while cumulative losses in economic activity (lost opportunity cost) would amount to around $66 billion. Due to the overall financial crisis, banking sector crisis, scarcity of foreign exchange, restrictions on overseas transactions, growing trade deficit and deteriorated investment climate, the value of the national currency further depreciated against the dollar. The exchange rate rebounded again surpassing 600 YR/USD in September 2019. As a result, prices of goods and services went up, and the cost of the minimum food basket increased by approximately 112% between February 2015 and August 2019. This calls for urgent interventions with the emphasis on exerting efforts to restore sustainable peace and building strong, fair and transparent state institutions.</p><p><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-socio-economic-update-issue-44-august-2019-enar">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-socio-economic-update-issue-44-august-2019-enar</a></p><p>(* B E)</p><p>Assessment of the Status of Solar PV in Yemen</p><p>This challenging situation has geared the Yemeni society towards resorting to reliance on solar photovoltaic (PV) as a survival solution to meet their basic electricity needs. PV technologies have growingly penetrated the market as the only way to get electricity in certain areas for both off-grid communities as well as groups affected by recurrent power shortages and as a new alternative to the expensive and often unreliable diesel-based small independent power producers. This has been fostered by the potential of solar PV technology to enhance the social and economic conditions in the country as well as the dramatic reduction in the prices of the technology of concern.</p><p>This report first describes briefly the electricity profile in Yemen. Next, it digs deeper into eight vital dynamic sectors in Yemen to estimate the technical potential, and assess PV application specifically, and energy aspects generally. Then, the report discusses the already existing financing mechanisms of PV projects, and points out to the major challenges faced. To address these challenges, three main business models are proposed. Following, the report portrays the existing supply chain of the PV market in Yemen, and details more on the technical specification and cost of technologies of PV systems (PV panels, batteries, etc.) available in Yemen. Finally, several recommendations are outlined based on the acquired knowledge and information.</p><p><a href="http://www.rcreee.org/content/assessment-status-solar-pv-yemen">http://www.rcreee.org/content/assessment-status-solar-pv-yemen</a></p><p><a href="http://www.rcreee.org/sites/default/files/121707-wp-public-p158449-wb-rcreee-solar-pv-in-yemen-report-002.pdf">http://www.rcreee.org/sites/default/files/121707-wp-public-p158449-wb-rcreee-solar-pv-in-yemen-report-002.pdf</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp14 Terrorismus / Terrorism</span></h2><p><span>(A T)</span></p><p><span>New #ISIS #Yemen photoset claims to show Sharia course graduation in Bayda'.
