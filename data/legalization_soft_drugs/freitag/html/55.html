He stressed that the repetition of these crimes indicates that they are directed by the highest leaders in the countries of aggression and their mercenaries.</p><p>Sam Organization For Rights and Liberties (independent human rights organization) monitored during the four years of the war on Yemen more than three thousand cases of torture in prisons, of which (800) cases only in 2018, some practiced individually and others collectively which some of them led to death according to last year July report.</p><p>According to the report, “the number of civilians killed under torture during this period amounted to 158 cases, including 56 cases in 2018, including 30 deaths in prisons affiliated with the legitimate forces other than Taiz, in which 10 prisoners were killed in the prisons controlled by the UAE”</p><p>The areas of legitimacy that are not mentioned in Sam report and they are likely to be in Marib.</p><p>Sam Organization cited a number of methods of torture practiced against detainees in these prisons, including: »kicking, beatings with batons and metal bars, burning, deprivation of food and water, also included the executions phantom, suspension for long hours, sexual harassment the use of sniffer dogs, burial pits sand, the use of drugs stimulant, spraying with cold water, deprivation of the visit, and mock trials.</p><p>The “Humanity Eye” Center for Rights and Development (Sana’a-based human rights organization) monitored 14 prisons in Marib governorate where prisoners and detainees are subjected to various types of physical , psychological torture, the dispossession of money sent to them by the people, exposure to insults, ridicule, burning, ironing, electric shocks, nails, erosion and health neglect ,and the prevention from preforming of religious rites.</p><p>“At al-Saleh Prison they were only giving us two minutes to defecate” said al-Wattari. “Abu Farouk (an interrogator) assaulted a prisoner while he was in the toilet in the bathroom because of his delay, and he repeated this with several prisoners. “We saw him kicking them from their behind naked outside” he added.</p><p>The released detainees tell the details of their transfer between the prisons.” They moved us blindfolded on the back of vehicles to transport soldiers where the crowd twice the number and then put them on them Tarbal (flexible plastic cover) shielded them from the sun and the gunmen step on their necks.”</p><p>“They went out every evening, took our clothes off and put us on mosquitoes” he says. ” five people kicked me on my kidneys, chest, and even my face” he added.</p><p>Torture continued for some prisoners and detainees for three years, even with the end of the investigation period, which led some of them to attempt suicide, as confirmed (11) prisoners who escaped from Marib prisons, who spoke to the investigator.</p><p>“Many of the detainees tried to commit suicide late at night by trying to hang themselves in clothes” says one</p><p>During the interrogation, torture intensifies in an attempt to extract confessions from prisoners and detainees, after which they are forced to sign many papers they do not know the content of.</p><p>Sexual And Physical Torture</p><p>Some detainees in Marib were subjected to sexual torture in different ways.</p><p>According to some survivors. “They put a broomstick in the anus of one of the detainees to extract a confession” says a survivor.</p><p>Another survivor adds “Tying the testicles, hanging five liters of water on them, trying to sexually assault two teenagers, and beating them violently because they shouted loudly at that attempt.”</p><p>The executioners, who used fame names to camouflage their real names, carried out repeated torture parties against detainees and prisoners. “They beat a prisoner with a stick on his head until he fainted, and every day he lost his balance as he rose to the bathroom.</p><p>Abu Qasha’a, another executioner, was coming to prison every three days, one day he beat one of the prisoners while praying, while Abu Laith whipped the inmates of Al-Saleh Institute on Eid al-Adha because they demanded better food for Eid, as some survivors confirmed.</p><p>Mental Illness</p><p>Many prisoners and detainees are suffering psychological conditions because of the torture. “They were handcuffing and assaulting people, including a young economics graduate – Syria, who was in a psychological state of aggression,” says Mustafa al-Matari. In the PSO prison, more than 30 patients were mentally ill, according to survivors.</p><p>The living conditions of prisoners and detainees in Marib prisons are no different from the health, psychological and physical conditions. Survivors say each detainee only has two liters of water in the bathroom per day, while the same amount is reserved for a whole cell for drink.</p><p>“We kept days and nights of hunger,” said Mustafa sadly. “The bread was rotten.” Majid adds: “The small salty piece of cheese came to us one day a week and each room a piece.” “Some insects were in our food.”</p><p>Confrontation</p><p>We now have sufficient evidence of physical, psychological and sexual torture of prisoners and detainees in Marib prisons and detention centers, which “are controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood under the umbrella of legitimacy and supported by Saudi Arabia,” as Murtada accuses.</p><p>The author of the investigation confirmed, saying: We decided to confront the officials in the Ministry of Interior to allow them to respond to our own evidence, we initiated contact with them on the official figures of the ministry, it was said that «officials are abroad», we sent them by Social media ( WhatsApp and Senegal and Imo), for more than a month, no one responded.”</p><p><span><a href="http://en.althawranews.net/2019/11/guantanamo-marib-killing-with-whips-psychological-and-physical-torture-sexual-abuses/">http://en.althawranews.net/2019/11/guantanamo-marib-killing-with-whips-psychological-and-physical-torture-sexual-abuses/</a></span></p><p><strong>(* B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>RASD coalition: VICTIMS OF LANDMINES IN YEMEN</strong></p><p>September 2014 – June 2018</p><p>Executive Summary</p><p>Yemen is classified as a country contaminated by mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW), and suffers mainly from unexploded ordnance (UXO) as a result of the numerous conflicts that have occurred since 1962 to 2010, as reported by many international and local reports addressing mines.</p><p>Over the last four years, such a problem – which Yemen already suffers from - has been compounded by the fact that, since its coup on September 21, 2014, the Houthi-Saleh militia has used landmines intensively as one of the most important means and methods of warfare in its armed confrontation with the forces of the legitimate government in order to curb and hinder their progress in the areas the militia used to control and was later defeated or in the areas it still controls and expects to witness military confrontations with the government forces.</p><p>The monitoring process documented in this report included: the registration of (906) people killed by landmine explosions from September 2014 to June 2018. These deaths occurred in 19 out of the total of 22 Yemeni governorates. The highest death toll occurred in Taiz governorate, totaling (289), followed by other governorates such as Lahj, al-Dhale’, Marib and Aden. The number of men killed by landmines was (713), and (60) for women. A large number of children were killed, totaling (133). Civilians represent the largest number, totaling (665), of the total landmine casualties in Yemen during the reporting period. Most of the victims were killed by antipersonnel mines, totaling (654) and accounted for 72% of the total casualties.</p><p>(1034) injured victims of landmine explosions and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) planted by Houthi-Saleh militia were distributed to 17 governorates. Taiz governorate ranked highest in the number of injured, totaling (417), followed by some governorates such as Marib (136), Lahj (85), al-Bayda (70), Aden (61), Jawf (58), Shabwah (51), al-Dhale’ (36), Sana’a (36) and Abyan (26), as well as other governorates.</p><p>The number of men casualties reached (795), women (56) and children (183). The largest number of casualties were caused by antipersonnel mines (542), followed by anti-vehicle mines (AVM) reaching (477) and (15) who were wounded by (IEDs). The majority of landmine victims, whether killed, injured, disabled or maimed, were civilians.</p><p>The Houthi militia bears direct responsibility for such casualties, whether killed or injured, because they are responsible for the planting of thousands of landmines of various kinds in most of the areas from which they have withdrawn or are still under their control.</p><p>This report provides a number of recommendations on landmine a tion addressed to the international community, the Houthi group, the Yemeni government and the Arab Coalition forces to do their utmost to eliminate landmines of various kinds and reduce their effects.</p><p><span><a href="http://ycmhrv.co/Home/MonthlyReport/nHs9dy3c/Victims-of-Landmines-in-Yemen--September-2014-To-June-2018">http://ycmhrv.co/Home/MonthlyReport/nHs9dy3c/Victims-of-Landmines-in-Yemen--September-2014-To-June-2018</a></span></p><p>if the link does not work, try via <span><a href="https://twitter.com/ycmhrv/status/1195980609858023424">https://twitter.com/ycmhrv/status/1195980609858023424</a></span></p><p>My remark: This is by a strictly anti-Houthi, pro-Hadi government organization.</p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2><p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p><p><strong>Ministerium erklärt Gesundheitsnotstand – Malaria und Denguefieber auf dem Vormarsch im Jemen</strong></p><p>Nach Informationen von JusticeNow! liegen bislang 116.522 Malariainfektionen, 500.000 Verdachtsfälle und 23.000 Fälle von Dengue vor. 51 Menschen sind bereits verstorben.</p><p>Am Dienstag rief das jemenitische Gesundheitsministerium in Sana’a laut Informationen von JusticeNow! „zur Kontrolle von Denguefieber, Malaria und Moskitoüberträgern den Gesundheitsnotstand“ aus. In den letzten Wochen kam es nach Angaben des von den Houthi-Rebellen kontrollierten Ministeriums im Nordwesten des Landes zu einer Welle von Infektionen, insbesondere ist hierbei Hodeida am Roten Meer betroffen, die wichtigste Hafenstadt des Landes, über die nahezu sämtliche Lebensmittelimporte und Hilfslieferungen ins Land kommen.</p><p>Bereits über 50 Tote</p><p>„116.522 bestätigte Malariainfektionen, dazu 500.000 Verdachtsfälle auf Malaria und 23.000 bestätigte Fälle von Denguefieber wurden gezählt“, so der Sprecher des Gesundheitsministeriums, Dr. Yousef Alhadri, gegenüber JusticeNow!. Bislang seien 51 Menschen an den Folgen beider Krankheiten verstorben.</p><p>Am Mittwoch war eine Delegation unter Leitung des Gesundheitsministers Dr. Taha al-Mutawakel in Hodeida, um nötige Schritte zu koordinieren. Es wurden bereits Ärzteteams aus der Hauptstadt Sana’a ins Hodeida-Direktorat transferiert, wie ein jemenitischer Journalist <span><a href="https://twitter.com/baseem_aljenani/status/1194563635282092032">berichtet</a></span>.</p><p>Das Ministerium nannte als Gründe für die Infektionswelle das heftige Einsetzen der „Regensaison und die Verschlechterung der Infrastruktur als Folge der Aggression“ (gemeint ist der viereinhalb Jahre währende Angriffskrieg Saudi-Arabiens und der Emirate gegen den Jemen).</p><p>Am Montag veröffentlichte Al-Jenani den <span><a href="https://twitter.com/baseem_aljenani/status/1193856884094177282">Screenshot einer Excel-Tabelle</a></span> lokaler Behörden, die die im Hodeida-Direktorat mit Malaria und Dengue Infizierten sowie die akkumulierten Todeszahlen im Zeitraum vom 27. Oktober bis 11. November auflistet (die Tabelle wurde für diesen Artikel übersetzt und konnte nachvollzogen werden). Aus Al-Jenanis Post geht hervor, dass „die Zahl der Todesfälle vergangene Woche 50 überschritten hat“, was die Opferzahlen der <span><a href="https://twitter.com/yemen_story/status/1194401077346603008">Website</a></span> Yemen Story (53) und die Angaben des Houthi-Gesundheitsministeriums (51) stützt.</p><p>„Die meisten Krankheiten und Epidemien werden aus den Gebieten unter der Besatzung [Saudi-Arabiens und der Emirate] übertragen“, auf die die Houthis keinen Zugriff hätten, so das Gesundheitsministerium weiter gegenüber JusticeNow!.

But the revelations about the new weapons cargo unloaded in Aden show that the Saudi prince does not care much about peace in Yemen. Since the Saudi invasion of Yemen, Riyadh chased two objectives. First, securing its eastern borders and second gaining the ideological leadership of the Arab countries by installing puppet governments. Looking at the past six months, which is seen by the political analysts as the phase of Yemen war results, shows that Saudi Arabia compared to its ally UAE is the biggest loser of the five-year-long war. Yemeni attacks on Saudi oil giant Aramco in mid-September displayed Saudi Arabia’s weakness</p><p>Saudi economic hardship and buying time </p><p>With Ansarullah attacks on Aramco, bin Salman’s strategic policy of selling Aramco shares has faced serious challenges, with many foreign bidders now stepping back from their earlier preparations to buy the shares.

One-third of children under 5 years showed symptoms of diarrhea in the 2 weeks before the survey. Estimated anemia prevalence in children aged 6-59 months is 86%. Regarding women’s nutritional status, 25% are underweight and 24% of the women are overweight or obese, overweight being more frequent in urban settings, and 71% of pregnant and lactating women suffer from anemia. Geographical access to health services is difficult, with 50% of the overall population having access to health care2 , and only 30% in rural areas. The current crisis is bringing additional challenges such as a deterioration of access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, dysfunctional health services, insecurity, lack of food, and adoption of negative coping mechanisms.</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-national-strategy-social-and-behavior-change-nutrition-2018-2021-enar">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-national-strategy-social-and-behavior-change-nutrition-2018-2021-enar</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>Yemenis go solar amid war energy shortage</p><p>When electricity was cut to Yemen’s capital four years ago after war broke out, Ebrahim al-Faqih saw a gap in the market and started selling solar panels.</p><p>“Even people who used to work selling food moved to work in solar energy because of the high demand,” Faqih said from his shop in Sanaa selling solar water heaters and panels imported from India and China.</p><p>The United Nations estimates that only 10% of the population had access to electricity after the conflict began.</p><p>Many areas need pumps to bring drinking and irrigation water to the surface and fuel shortages have also made water hard to come by.</p><p>“Electricity these days isn’t just for lighting — electricity is life,” said Muhammad Yahya, whose home in Sanaa is powered by rooftop solar panels.</p><p>He sees solar energy as a stop-gap measure for those who can get it and hopes everyone will have mains electricity when the war ends.</p><p>There is no state power supply to Sanaa and many other areas, and buying a diesel generator or hooking up to a neighborhood generator is polluting and too expensive for many people.</p><p>“Alternative energy is better, it changed my life dramatically.

I just knew I had to do something,” said Muna Luqman, MADRE’s partner and founder of Food4Humanity, as she shared the harrowing story of her mediation between armed groups in the city of Taiz, Yemen.</p><p>Muna described how children were trapped in an orphanage in the crossfire between the rebels and the military. They had run out of food and water, and their caretakers desperately called on Muna for help. With MADRE’s partner organization, Food4Humanity, Muna had previously supported the orphanage, so they knew they could count on her.</p><p>Muna jumped into action, spending days going backand-forth between the armed groups, who gave little thought to children trapped in the fighting. Determined to find a way to bring these children to safety, she won concessions from the fighters. First, she was allowed to bring the children food and water; next, she secured safe passage to evacuate them to a safer area.</p><p>As Muna’s story shows, time and time again, women take the lead to protect communities and secure peace. They know firsthand who is in danger and what they need — and what it will take to achieve lasting peace. That’s why MADRE is proud to partner with women like Muna.</p><p>MADRE became the first international organization to provide Muna’s organization with funding. Thanks to members’ support, we sent food, water and mosquito nets to protect against deadly malaria. And together, we helped Muna and Food4Humanity bring clean water and peace to two struggling communities.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.madre.org/press-publications/your-support-action/mobilizing-urgent-aid-yemen">https://www.madre.org/press-publications/your-support-action/mobilizing-urgent-aid-yemen</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/iom">International Organization for Migration</a></span>: IOM Provides Over 1 Million Health Consultations in Yemen Since Start of 2019</p><p>With more than four years of conflict pushing the public sector to a breaking point, people in Yemen are struggling to access health care.

It is so favorable for Riyadh that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman hailed the deal as a new chapter in Yemen’s history and a step toward ending the war in the country.</p><p>There are a few points to be made about the deal: first, many social media users and experts believe that the deal is, in fact, a Yemeni version of the Balfour Declaration which led to the creation of Israel in Palestine. Riyadh intends to occupy Yemen through the deal.</p><p>Second, the deal was basically brokered between the Saudi and UAE forces while the Yemeni representatives and Houthis were not involved, so it cannot be an agreement between south and north Yemen. The Houthi movement responded to the deal, saying that it is a useless agreement that cannot be implemented and has nothing to do with the Yemeni nation.</p><p>Third, the deal seeks to share power between Saudi and UAE forces in the country’s southern provinces. Therefore, Saudi Arabia and the UAE will indirectly exercise power in these areas.</p><p>The deal was boasted so important that bin Salman and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan were present during its signing process in Riyadh. The deal calls for the formation of a new cabinet of no more than 24 ministers within 30 days that would have equal representation for northerners and southerners.

P)</span></p><p>STC: Riyadh Agreement will address the Southern issue</p><p>In reaching this agreement, the STC over a period of several weeks engaged constructively with the dialogue process in good faith and with no pre-conditions. This approach came against a backdrop of escalation on the ground against our people, as evident by the attacks against South Yemen at the start of August. As we stated clearly from the beginning, the solution to the crisis was and remains a political one. This is why the STC took all necessary measures to ensure the protection of civilians in the South, restore security and stability in Aden, and intensify our diplomatic efforts to bring about a sustainable and long lasting solution that meets the legitimate aims of our people. For too long the South had been marginalised and neglected. That status quo was no longer acceptable, and events on the ground from August changed the context and made clear the urgent need for a solution for the Southern cause.<br /> Against this background, the Riyadh Agreement is a positive first step to shifting the status quo. For the first time there is a formal recognition of the unique nature of the Southern cause and Southerners’ needs, including our legitimate demand to determine our own future. This is the cornerstone of the Southern cause that the STC can never renege on. In this regard, we now look forward to engaging with the Yemeni government, as an equal partner and signatory of this Agreement, to ensure the security, governance, protection, and development of South Yemen.<br /> To be clear: the Riyadh Agreement offers a critical window of opportunity but more work lies ahead. It is a key stepping stone to the broader political effort under the auspices of the UN. As we have reiterated previously, any UN political process needs to be broad and inclusive at all stages, and to address a comprehensive range of issues, including the Southern issue. A piecemeal approach would only fall short in delivery as we have seen with past political initiatives. We therefore welcome the recognition of our key role in the Agreement and our guaranteed participation in the UN political process led by Envoy Martin Griffiths. For the first time, the UN process would have legitimate Southern representatives through the STC at the negotiating table to advocate for the South within the broader political solution for the Yemeni crisis. We remain fully committed to playing our part and to intensifying our diplomatic engagement for a solution for the South through democratic means.<br /> We remain cautiously optimistic about this Agreement. The true test of any agreement is credible implementation, and we are not naive to this.</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/14810">http://en.adenpress.news/news/14810</a></span></p><p>(A P)</p><p>Film: Southern Separatist forces welcome Saudi-backed peace deal</p><p>Southern Separatist forces, backed by the United Arab Emirates, say they welcome a peace deal signed with the Saudi-backed government last week</p><p>Speaking for the UAE-backed southern separatists Brigadier Abu Bakr Jabr, the Deputy Director of Aden Security says "As long as there were agreement and understanding and there was a signing.

Not only has the U.S. not brought peace, but there is little reason to think that our government is capable of doing so. More to the point, the U.S. has no right to keep meddling in the affairs of these nations. It would also be accurate to say that the more American involvement there has been in the region, the less <em>pax</em> there has been there. There is nowhere else in the world where our foreign policy is as intensely militarized, and it is no accident that it is also where our foreign policy is most destructive. If the U.S. genuinely desired stability and the security of energy supplies, it would not be waging an economic war on Iran, and it wouldn’t be fueling a disgraceful war on Yemen. The author of that piece, William Wechsler, notably has nothing to say about either one of those policies.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/10/us-has-one-last-chance-halt-its-withdrawal-middle-east/160975/">Opponents of U.S. withdrawal</a></span> from the Middle East make two major claims: that withdrawal would harm U.S. interests and that it would make the region worse off than it already is. The second point is wrong but debatable, and the first one depends on an absurdly expansive definition of what U.S. interests are. </p><p> The U.S. didn’t have and didn’t need a large military presence in the Middle East for the entire Cold War, and it doesn’t need to have one now. Having a military presence in the region has directly contributed to increased threats to U.S. security through terrorism, and it made the Iraq war debacle possible. The greatest harm to U.S. security has come from our ongoing extensive military involvement in this part of the world.</p><p>Once we acknowledge those errors, the next step is not to fall into the same patterns out of a misguided desire for “leadership” and domination.

The title of the essay is “The US Has One Last Chance to Halt Its Withdrawal from the Middle East.” The author is a former deputy assistant secretary of defense.</p><p>The purpose of our present-day Mr. X is to sound the alarm about the United States lowering its profile in the Middle East. To avert that prospect, he proposes what can only be termed a strategy of staying-the-course-while-ignoring-the-facts.</p><p>Yet the essence of X’s argument boils down to this: setting aside these recent errors of judgment by George W. Bush and Barack Obama, U.S. policy in the region has actually been a smashing success. From the end of World War II until ever-so-recently, Washington pursued a course in the Middle East that was reasoned, careful, and eminently wise.</p><p>When one encounters a claim of an American-constructed <em>Pax, </em>the first rule is to look for what the writer leaves out. In this case, among the incidents and developments that our X totally ignores are these</p><p>Admit these into the conversation and the question you confront is this one: what Pax? In truth, Pax Americana no more describes the postwar Middle East than the phrase “Long Peace” describes the Cold War. The purpose of such formulations is to preclude actual thinking, attaching labels to preempt analysis.</p><p>“It took many decades to build a Pax Americana in the Middle East,” X writes. Not true: it took only a handful of hours—the time he invested in writing his essay. The Pax Americana is a figment of X’s imagination.</p><p>Yet once having conjured up his fictive Pax, X easily convinces himself that it can exist again, if only the next president—he writes off Trump as a total loss—will act to “reestablish American leadership in the Middle East, restore deterrence with our adversaries, and begin renewing trust with our partners and allies.” But what does “leadership” actually mean in this context? What will it entail? What will it cost? Once again, when it comes to specifics, X is essentially silent, offering only this: “The next commander in chief will require political fortitude to lead the United States back to its traditional role in the region, demonstrating what in previous generations was deemed a profile in courage.”</p><p>That and four bucks will get you a latte.</p><p>All of that said, I submit that X has written something worthy of reflection. Here on full display is a model of establishment thinking—heavy on clichés, light on substance, and short of memory.</p><p>Let me briefly sketch out an alternative narrative that more accurately captures our present predicament.</p><p>Since the end of World War II, successive administrations have sought to devise a formula for assuring American consumers access to Persian Gulf oil while also satisfying pressing domestic political interests. Over a period of decades, that effort succeeded chiefly in giving birth to new problems. Out of these multiplying difficulties came the 9/11 attacks and their immediate sequel, a “war on terrorism” meant to settle matters once and for all.</p><p>To state the matter bluntly, 9/11 was an expression of chickens coming home to roost, a massive strategic failure that the ensuing military campaigns beginning in 2001 and continuing to the present moment have affirmed. Given the dimensions of that failure, the likelihood of resuscitating X’s illusory Pax is essentially zero – by <em>Andrew Bacevich</em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-blob-still-chasing-after-pax-americana/">https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-blob-still-chasing-after-pax-americana/</a></span></p><p>referring to <span><a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/10/us-has-one-last-chance-halt-its-withdrawal-middle-east/160975/">https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/10/us-has-one-last-chance-halt-its-withdrawal-middle-east/160975/</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp9a USA-Iran Krise: Wachsende Spannungen am Golf / US-Iran crisis: Mounting tensions at the Gulf</span></h2><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>US dirty hands behind violent protests in Iran?</p><p>All sovereign independent countries not subservient to US interests are on its target list for regime change — by preemptive wars, color revolutions, old-fashioned coups, targeted assassinations, economic terrorism, and/or other hostile actions.</p><p>Color revolutions are a US specialty.
