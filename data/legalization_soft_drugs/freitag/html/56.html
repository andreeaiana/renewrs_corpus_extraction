But the Saudis want the effort directed at the north, from where all the attacks on Saudi air bases, airports and oil infrastructure are launched.</p><p>Having tried and failed to bring the defunct regime of the former Yemeni dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh back to life <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/tags/ahmed-saleh">through his son</a>, the Emiratis have embarked on another strategy. </p><p>Amid a widescale troop redeployment, the UAE is clearly backing southern separatists.</p><p>Maisari said the separatist takeover of Aden had been powered by 400 armoured vehicles driven by mercenaries doing the UAE’s bidding.</p><p>Eyes on Hodeidah</p><p>Aden may not be only the only Yemeni port to fall to an Emirati-funded separatist southern state. </p><p>Dr Mohammad al-Rumihi, a Kuwaiti political analyst writing in the Saudi-controlled Asharq al-Awsat, suggested the breakup of Yemen, a state he depicted as being in a permanent state of war, was a <a href="https://twitter.com/aawsat_news/status/1162700602687860736?s=12">good thing.</a></p><p>“However, if we have a true republic in the south that would pave the way for the building of a modern state there, it will then be able to control the mainland in the south and safeguard the Red Sea - the Strait of Mandib,” he wrote.</p><p>Warming to this theme of the breakup of Yemen, Rumihi eyed the northern port of Hodeidah as the next prize for southern separatists.</p><p>“If we annex the port of Hodaidah (to the south), the north would then be able to find its own mechanism that would guarantee a certain degree of stability,” he posited.</p><p>This amounts to a policy of letting the unconquerable north of Yemen rot. </p><p>Is this in the interests of Riyadh, which already is hard put to protect its airports and military bases from Houthi drones and rockets deep inside the kingdom?</p><p>And who, by the way, has<a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/why-pakistan-sending-1000-troops-saudi-arabia"> sent its troops</a> “on a training and advise mission” to guard the Saudi royal family? Pakistan.</p><p>History of bad blood</p><p>The confidence that the Emiratis show in pursuing strategies which openly diverge with Riyadh’s is a relatively recent phenomenon in the relationship between the two Arabian Peninsula states.</p><p>As Hilal Khashan, professor of political science at the American University in Beirut, <a href="https://www.meforum.org/7227/saudi-emirates-ties">writes</a>, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates have endured decades of hostility over land and sea disputes, and rivalry between the Zayeds and the Sauds.</p><p>When a young, power-hungry Saudi prince in Mohammed bin Salman happened along, the elder and wiser Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed was not slow to seize his opportunity.</p><p>It was he and his ambassador Yousef al-Otaiba, not the Saudi establishment, who beat a path to the door of the Oval Office for Mohammed bin Salman, as I have recorded in past reports.</p><p>But the fact that Mohammed bin Salman is now surrounded by henchmen whose primary loyalty is to Abu Dhabi’s crown prince has not gone unnoticed by the rest of the royal family.</p><p>Even with their pliant prince in total control of the family and kingdom, the Emiratis keep a close watch on affairs in Riyadh and monitor the slightest deviation from orthodoxy – by David Hearst</p><p><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/When-the-Saudis-and-Emiratis-fall-out">https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/When-the-Saudis-and-Emiratis-fall-out</a></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Why Saudi-UAE alliance is cracking: Yemen, Iran, and Trump</strong></p><p>The split comes as the White House’s shifting policies and wavering support for Riyadh’s and Abu Dhabi’s regional ventures are bringing the two Arab allies’ differing views on how to counter Iran to the forefront.</p><p>And President Trump himself, whose ties to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman are becoming problematic for United States allies in the region, is increasingly playing the part of homewrecker, raising questions about whether the Arab world’s top power couple is heading toward divorce.</p><p>But their most pressing point of conflict is in Yemen.</p><p>The public spat between the partners quickly became nasty, and revealing.</p><p>On Tuesday, from Riyadh, Mr. Hadi publicly blasted the UAE for backing the southern separatists, accusing the UAE in a separate letter to the United Nations Security Council of pursuing a “fragmentation” of Yemen through arming the group.</p><p>In Saudi Arabia, where everything Yemen-related is vetted by the palace, and the Yemeni government-in-exile is closely managed, it is widely thought that Mr. Hadi was also speaking for Saudi leadership.</p><p>“Hadi is reflecting the Saudi point of view of the UAE’s behavior in Yemen,” says Imad K. Harb, director of research and analysis at the Arab Center Washington DC. “For the Yemeni government to say the Emiratis are not doing the right thing in southern Yemen, that is a sign that the Saudis are not satisfied with their actions.”</p><p>In the UAE, commentators close to the ruling families responded by declaring the Saudi-backed Yemeni government ungrateful, corrupt, and a failure, insisting that Yemen will “be difficult to reunite after today.”</p><p>The fact that both the UAE and Saudi Arabia employ an army of Twitter bots and script social media influencers and personalities to post talking points elevates the social media war to a state-level spat.</p><p>Iran</p><p>The Yemen tensions come in part from fundamentally different philosophies on how to counter Iran.</p><p>While Saudi Arabia sees a zero-sum game where its security can be guaranteed only by regime change in Tehran, the UAE, which is just miles from Iran and would be the hardest hit by any military conflict, seeks merely to contain and push back Iranian influence in the Arab world.</p><p>Trump</p><p>But perhaps nothing is driving the wedge between Saudi Arabia and the UAE more than the behavior of the Trump administration itself.</p><p>After agreeing to billions in business deals with Washington, the UAE bought into the Saudi crown prince’s playbook: work closely and directly with President Trump in return for U.S. support and protection for Gulf projects and wars across the region.</p><p>In recent months that sure thing has turned into a bad bet: President Trump has called off military strikes on Iran; done a reversal and embraced their rival, Qatar; and soured on Gulf interference in Sudan and Libya – by Taylor Luck</p><p><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2019/0823/Why-Saudi-UAE-alliance-is-cracking-Yemen-Iran-and-Trump">https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2019/0823/Why-Saudi-UAE-alliance-is-cracking-Yemen-Iran-and-Trump</a></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen's southern tensions crack open deadly faultlines in Taiz</strong></p><p>Emboldened by the SBF's successes in the south, UAE-backed Salafis have made a gambit for greater control north of Aden</p><p> a few kilometres north in Taiz province, the defeat of forces loyal to President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi has sparked a new confrontation, as other Emirati proxies make a play for control.</p><p>The province is already the location of a hot front between the Houthi movement and its enemies.</p><p>Now, following days of clashes along the main highway between the cities of Aden and Taiz, some Yemenis fear greater destabilisation. It is a situation, they say, that could hand their home to the control of foreign powers.</p><p>"The UAE wants our support and to perpetuate battles in the city like they did in Aden, but we need to be free and to manage our city ourselves," Maged Khalil, a 42-year-old teacher in Taiz, told Middle East Eye.</p><p>Others view it differently, however, and see an opportunity for Taiz's provincial capital to be opened up to different groups, having previously been ruled primarily by the Saudi-backed al-Islah party.</p><p>The battles in Taiz are between two groups with little love lost between them and a history of clashing: UAE-backed Salafis and Saudi client al-Islah.</p><p>However, they also reflect a growing divide between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh,</p><p>But now proxy forces, supported by the Emiratis and the Saudis and once focused on the battle against the Houthis, are increasingly fighting one another.</p><p>Roadside clashes</p><p>in Taiz city, clashes between the Salafis, who are another Emirati-backed group, and al-Islah over control of Taiz's organs of government had only recently settled down.</p><p>But the SBF's takeover of Aden further emboldened the Salafis, who had largely abandoned the area until just recently, say residents and fighters.</p><p>Intense battles broke out in al-Turbah last week between UAE-backed forces led by Salafi leader Abu al-Abbas, and the pro-Hadi Fourth Brigade forces, led by fighters affiliated to al-Islah.</p><p>Al-Turbah lies on the strategic main road between Taiz and Aden and the route has been Taiz's only artery since the Houthis began besieging it from three directions in 2015.</p><p>Clashes disrupted that traffic on 15 August, however, as the Salafis attempted to take control of al-Turbah's police station.</p><p>The forces were unable to capture the station, but the next day they opened a new front in the al-Berain area nearby and blocked the road once again.</p><p>Ongoing tensions</p><p>A year ago, after fierce clashes between Salafi and pro-Hadi fighters in Taiz, a mediation committee ordered the Salafis to leave the city with their families for rural areas, handing control to al-Islah - which is the Yemeni branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p>Marzouq al-Qaderi, a soldier fighting alongside the Salafis in Taiz, told MEE that the Salafis had left to avoid further disputes and to focus on the wider war.</p><p>"We left the city to al-Islah and went to fight the Houthis on the front lines. But al-Islah kept chasing hardline Salafi members and firing non-Islah leaders from their positions in public offices," he said.</p><p>But Qaderi said Taiz must be "a province for all people, and not only for Islahis".</p><p>Emirati hands</p><p>Supporters of al-Islah like Maged Khalil, however, are wary of another UAE-backed attempt to capture the city, already largely surrounded by the Houthis.</p><p>"Everyone in Taiz knows that the UAE wants to impose the SBF's control, just like Aden, and besiege the city's last remaining entrance," Khalil told MEE.</p><p>"But al-Islah rejects this idea, and that has been the main problem with the UAE's presence in Taiz."</p><p>The UAE, he said, has been trying to "plant several hands" in Taiz and "when one of them fails, they replace it with a new one".</p><p>During the fighting last week in al-Turbah, Khalil said, the Salafis were led by Abu al-Abbas, the UAE-funded Salafi militant leader designated by the US as an al-Qaeda and Islamic State group supporter in October 2017.</p><p>"As Abu al-Abbas failed to control the main road, the mediation committee will bring in a new arm of the UAE," Khalil said, referring to al-Amaliqah.</p><p>The UAE has supported its southern allies to expand the SBF's control on Aden, Lahj, Abyan and al-Dhale. Taiz and Shabwa might become the SBF’s next targets, but al-Islah has been resisting their advances.</p><p>“Al-Islah is the only obstacle in front of the UAE in Taiz, and if not for al-Islah, Taiz would have fallen under the control of the UAE and its militia,” Khalil said.</p><p>According to Khalil, pro-UAE residents of Taiz have been accusing al-Islah of dismissing heads of government institutions and expelling Salafis from Taiz’s Old City based on unfounded accusations. </p><p>"Everyone knows that Abu al-Abbas is one of the UAE's hands in Taiz, and he fought the government for years," Khalil said.</p><p>"But then pro-government forces liberated Taiz from UAE-backed forces, and that is when the UAE supporters resorted to those accusations."</p><p>Saleh's forces unnerve</p><p>The Salafis aren't the only forces backed by the Emiratis in the area, with fighters commanded by Tareq Saleh, the nephew of the late president Ali Abdullah Saleh, also present.</p><p><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemens-southern-tensions-crack-open-deadly-faultlines-taiz">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemens-southern-tensions-crack-open-deadly-faultlines-taiz</a></p><p>My remark: More on Taiz in cp6.</p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/mmc">Mixed Migration Centre</a>: Record numbers of refugees and migrants arrive in Yemen amidst intensifying and complicated war</strong></p><p>Despite the ongoing war and escalating humanitarian crisis in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=23&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVgcmJ8YbkAhUMx4UKHX76B_8QFjAWegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cfr.org%2Finteractive%2Fglobal-conflict-tracker%2Fconflict%2Fwar-yemen&amp;usg=AOvVaw1F1ghs4dIkmETj7lfsoeoX">Yemen</a>, this year has seen a spike in the number of arrivals of East African refugees and migrants to Yemen. <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/flow-monitoring-points-migrant-arrivals-and-yemeni-returns-saudi-arabia-april-2019-enar">IOM estimates</a> that 18,320 refugees and migrants arrived in April 2019 and 18,904 people arrived in May 2019 – representing the highest monthly arrivals figures since data became available in 2006. In total, 84,378 East Africans are <a href="https://migration.iom.int/datasets/yemen-%E2%80%94-flow-monitoring-registry-%E2%80%94-january-2018-june-2019">estimated</a> to have arrived in the first six months of 2019. This route is already the largest mixed migration route out of East Africa. If trends continue, arrivals for 2019 could exceed the record <a href="https://www.iom.int/sites/default/files/dtm/yemen_dtm_201801-12.pdf">159,838 refugees and migrants</a>estimated to have arrived in Yemen in 2018.</p><p>Many of these refugees and migrants <a href="http://www.mixedmigration.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/009_blinded_by_hope.pdf">intend to transit through Yemen</a> en route to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Ethiopians make up 90% of the <a href="https://www.iom.int/sites/default/files/dtm/yemen_dtm_201801-12.pdf">arrivals into Yemen</a> while Somalis account for around 10% of arrivals in 2019. The mixed <a href="https://migration.iom.int/reports/yemen-%E2%80%94-flow-monitoring-dashboard-april-2019">migration flow</a> to Yemen is largely made up of young men, however, nearly 20% are women and around 10% are children. High unemployment rates and political insecurity are major drivers for <a href="http://www.mixedmigration.org/country/ethiopia/">Ethiopians</a> and Somalis to the Gulf, where they hope to find employment, better opportunities, and security. However, migrants and refugees travelling along this route face violations of their human rights at every <a href="https://www.irinnews.org/photo-feature/2018/03/23/crossroads-djibouti-african-migrants-who-defy-yemen-s-war">stage of the journey</a>, with a high risk of being <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/17/yemen-detained-african-migrants-tortured-raped">trafficked, kidnapped</a>, or dying at sea on one of the busiest maritime mixed migration routes in the world.</p><p>In addition, the fragile political situation in Yemen has opened up new avenues for smuggling operations and may lure refugees and migrants to travel with the <a href="http://www.mixedmigration.org/articles/desperate-determination/">perception of ease</a> of movement through Yemen. In reality, the deteriorating situation in Yemen has created new loopholes for strong trafficking networks and new opportunities to exploit refugees and migrants along this route. Migrants also feel the impact of the deepening crisis in Yemen and are often impacted by the conflict and insecurity. </p><p><a href="http://www.mixedmigration.org/articles/record-numbers-of-refugees-and-migrants-arrive-in-yemen-amidst-intensifying-and-complicated-war/">http://www.mixedmigration.org/articles/record-numbers-of-refugees-and-migrants-arrive-in-yemen-amidst-intensifying-and-complicated-war/</a> = <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/record-numbers-refugees-and-migrants-arrive-yemen-amidst-intensifying-and-complicated">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/record-numbers-refugees-and-migrants-arrive-yemen-amidst-intensifying-and-complicated</a></p><p><strong>(** B E H P)</strong></p><p><strong>The importance of desalination to Saudi Arabia and Yemen</strong></p><p>Officials in Riyadh must realize that lending Saudi technology for desalination to Iraq, Yemen, and other countries where environmental degradation and political violence <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/11/15/9738342/climate-change-conflict-terrorism">feed</a> off one another will serve not only the Kingdom’s neighbors but also Saudi national interests.</p><p>A cost-effective approach to desalination would encourage economic development and diversification in Iraq and Yemen, in turn contributing to stability along Saudi Arabia’s two most explosive borders. Desalination’s ongoing success in Saudi Arabia hints at what the technology can do for Iraqis, Yemenis, and Saudi Arabia’s own national security.</p><p>The more the kingdom’s population <a href="https://www.stats.gov.sa/en/news/242">grows</a>, the more Saudi Arabia will come to depend on desalination. Few alternatives remain available to the Kingdom. Many environmental scientists <a href="https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2015/06/nasa-data-reveals-major-aquifers-depleting-faster-recharge/">consider</a> the Arabian Aquifer System, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/9/14/9323379/saudi-arabia-squandered-its-groundwater-and-agriculture-collapsed">supplies</a> much of the Kingdom’s water, the world’s most stressed aquifer.</p><p>“Saudi Arabia has been the main cause of instability and turmoil in Yemen, along with American foreign and counterterrorism policy there,” said Rosie Bsheer, an assistant professor of history at Harvard University. “To speak of Saudi Arabia providing Yemen with desalination technology as a way to ‘stabilize’ the country—no less as the Saudi regime has been indiscriminately killing and starving the Yemeni population—is deeply troubling and erases a long history of Saudi violence in Yemen.”</p><p>If Saudi Arabia came to view sharing technology for desalination with its southwestern neighbor as a matter of national security, not humanitarian aid, Saudi officials would likely appreciate the need to address Yemen’s humanitarian crisis, combat water scarcity there, and facilitate desalination abroad.</p><p>Self-interest—the same principle that inspired Saudi Arabia to fund desalination in the first place—may become what forces the kingdom to give this technology to Yemen.

Why does the United Arab Emirates support the GGK?</p><p>The Hareket Southern Movement or has been working for 12 years to rebuild South Yemen, which existed until 1990. With the start of the war in 2015, they founded the GGK. The UAE believes that a united Yemen will be under the influence of Saudi Arabia and believes that it will have more voice in a divided Yemen. Therefore, it provides full support to GGK. The administration of Abu Dhabi wants to be on the table even if Yemen will not be divided and uses the GGK as a bargaining chip against Saudi Arabia. The families of the GGK leaders also live in the UAE.Therefore, the GGK has to listen to every word of Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Why have coalition partners fallen together? What are the next targets of the SSC?</p><p>The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been pursuing different goals since the beginning of the Yemen Civil War. Their strategies, their surrogate powers and even their weapons were different. The UAE decided to withdraw its forces from Yemen when the GGK thought it had enough power. He gave the green light to the GGK to break the ropes with Hadi. After Aden, the GGK will try to seize the port cities such as Al-Mukelle, al-Gayda and Hadramut.</p><p>Is it true that the GGK receives support from foreign powers?</p><p>GGK is like the UAE's special army.

The clearance application must be submitted upon departure from the port of origin of their cargo and at least five days prior to arrival at the port of destination in Yemen. All bilateral humanitarian assistance (bulk, break-bulk or containerized) destined for Yemen is also subject to UNVIM and must be transhipped through Djibouti port, the location of UNVIM’s Head Office, where it will be off-loaded and screened.

Während man sich um gute Beziehungen mit dem größten Unterstützer der Hadi-Regierung Saudi-Arabien bemüht, wird Dieser zunehmend ungeduldig und attackiert Militärbasen in der Stadt.

Deswegen müssen wir Schritt für Schritt vorgehen.“ Es gehe darum „die ganze Gesellschaft auf die neuen Aufgaben [der Beteiligung der Bundeswehr an Kriegen] vorzubereiten.“ In diesem Prozess der systematischen Militarisierung der Gesellschaft gibt es die beschriebenen kleinen „Schritte“. Und es gab die großen „Schritte“:</p><p>Trotz dieser kleinen und großen Schritte, die zur Militarisierung der Bundesrepublik Deutschland seit Jahrzehnten unternommen wurden, verfügt ein großer Teil der Bevölkerung noch immer über die „Friedensinstinkte“. Zur Beförderung der weiteren Militarisierung ist daher die Militarisierung der Parteienlandschaft wichtig.</p><p>Und eine Beteiligung der Bundeswehr an einer „Mission“ zum „Schutz von Handelsschiffen im Persischen Golf“ ist aktuell nur möglich, wenn sich Parteien, die nicht mit Militarismus gleichgesetzt werden, für ein solches Abenteuer aussprechen. Just dies wurde vor wenigen Wochen erreicht. „Grüne machen sich locker für neuen Militäreinsatz“, titelte am 6. August die „Taz“. Der außenpolitische Sprecher der Grünen-Fraktion, Omid Nouripour, und die Grünen-Parteivorsitzenden Annalena Baerbock und Robert Habeck sprachen sich für eine deutsche Teilnahme an einer solchen „Mission“ im Persischen Golf aus. Einzige Bedingung: Diese dürfe „nicht unter amerikanischer Führung“ stattfinden, es müsse eine „europäische Mission“ sein. Dabei ist ein möglicher Einsatz von deutschen Soldaten im Mittleren Osten – und damit potentiell in einem kommenden Iran-Krieg – eine Sache.

The same is true of the Dogs of War in today’s Persian Gulf.</p><p>As indicated above, Trump’s “maximum pressure” project relied on applying two primary levers against Iran: </p><p>Speedy strangulation of the country’s economy through sanctions, which he hoped would lead to an explosion of popular Iranian discontent that would put pressure on the country’s leaders to either meet Washington’s demands or be overthrown.</p><p>A credible threat of massively debilitating military strikes, to be conducted by the United States either alone or in conjunction with allies.</p><p>Successful use of both these levers needed the active support of other parties. For the sanctions to “work” as designed, Washington needed to be able to cow all other governments to go along with them. It also needed a critical mass of “the Iranian people” to blame all the sanctions-induced belt-tightening on their own rulers, not on Washington. In the case of the military threat, for that to work it needed to engage the active support of as many other militaries as possible—and also, to be “credible” in the sense that the damage threatened to Iran would be massive and unacceptable to Iran’s rulers and people, while any counter-damage suffered by the United States and its allies would fall far below some “acceptable” limit.</p><p>There may yet be a military conflagration in the Gulf, though the chances of that diminish by the day. But whether there is one or not, the ugly, bullying way President Trump and his key advisors have dealt with the region has already inflicted deep harm on far too many Iranians (and Yemenis.) It has also considerably weakened Washington’s role in the international system and exacerbated instabilities in that system that will be felt in areas far from the Persian Gulf – by Helena Cobban</p><p><a href="https://lobelog.com/the-dogs-of-war-that-have-not-barked/">https://lobelog.com/the-dogs-of-war-that-have-not-barked/</a></p><p>(A P)</p><p>Iran Confirms Monitoring of Foreign Forces Coming from Outside</p><p>The commander of the naval force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, Admiral Alireza Tenksiri, has confirmed the monitoring of foreign forces coming from outside the region permanently, and declared full readiness to address any potential threats.<br /> Admiral Tenksiri said that foreign forces coming from outside the region do not provide security for us, so we and the rest of the region must provide security, according to the agency "IRNA."</p><p><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=8414">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=8414</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp10 Großbritannien / Great Britain</span></h2><p><span>(B K P)</span></p><p>Sarah Waldron from CAAT is in touch today to give an update:</p><p>“Dear friends,</p><p>I wanted to share the latest developments since our landmark victory this Summer – when the Court of Appeal found that the Government acted unlawfully in licensing arms sales to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The bad news first: as we feared, our fight must go on.

Now the new stance raises a question: What has happened in Sudan’s power structure that such an approach is embraced by the new leaders?</p><p>The main nucleus of these forces is the “Janjoids” who are accused of the Darfur repression in 2002. The African country cited its “Islamic responsibility to save the two holy mosques, the religion, and beliefs” as the main justification for it to take part in the coalition. But the main reason is the severe poverty in the country and the military body’s seeking support from Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the face of the opposition. According to the New York Times, teenagers and mercenaries, who were trained in Saudi Arabia’s border areas, account for 40 percent of the Sudanese forces in the war. The soldiers are reportedly paid $480 and the Janjoid officers are paid $530 a month. The forces who served beyond six months in the war received a bonus of $10,000.</p><p>Reports suggest that many of those who return from the war buy houses in the capital Khartoum or make investment in the capital and other important cities. Saudi Arabia and the UAE make the most out of Sudan’s poverty to recruit fighters. Al Jazeera news network in a report said that every Sudanese military personnel yearns for being chosen to serve in Yemen. But these forces are in fact devotees for Saudi and Emirati officers on the ground. According to some reports, the Saudi and Emirati officers order attacks or retreat with radio headsets given to the mercenary forces’ commanders and never accompany them in their operations.</p><p>Sudan’s administrative council and Saudi Arabia </p><p>5 out of 11 members of the newly introduced transitional administration in Sudan are military staff. The head of the new governing body is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is the commander of the Sudanese forces in Yemen. Another member is Dagalo who has a close relation with al-Burhan and is a patron of participation in Yemen war. The administrative council will be the main determiner of the foreign policy and will hold the right to declare war and peace.</p><p>Saudi Arabia plays a key role in Sudan’s developments and has already built a ground for its allied military commanders to rise to power in the post-Bashir Sudan. Al-Rakoba newspaper of Sudan in June wrote that Saudi Crown Prince stipulated Sudan’s stay in the war as a condition for Saudi Arabia’s all-out support to post-coup Sudan. Riyadh appears to seek to both derail Sudan’s uprising like what it did to the Arab uprisings and also deal on Yemen with the military leaders having sway in Sudan’s equations. Last week, Al-Quds Al-Arabi reported that Dagalo agreed with Saudis to send 6,000 more troops to Yemen after Eid al-Adha. On Monday, Adel the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir said that Saudi Arabia backs removing Sudan from the list of countries labeled state sponsor of terrorism and that it is a “matter of time.”</p><p>The opposition’s announcement about its stay in the Saudi-led coalition is the major concession made to Saudi Arabia and the UAE— both the key military council backers—to persuade the military leaders to yield to the formation of the administrative council.</p><p><a href="http://alwaght.com/en/news/160122">http://alwaght.com/en/news/160122</a></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>MACHTTEILUNG IM SUDAN: Altes in neuem Gewand</p><p>Übergangsregierung im Sudan nimmt Form an.

Diese übernehmen die Führung des Landes in der auf 39 Monate angesetzten Übergangsphase. Der Rat setzt sich zusammen aus fünf zivilen Vertretern aus den Reihen der Oppositionsallianz »Kräfte für Freiheit und Wandel« (FFC), fünf Angehörigen des bis dato regierenden Militärischen Übergangsrats (TMC) und einem unabhängigen Vertreter. Zwar wurde damit die seit dem Sturz Omar Al-Baschirs im April bestehende Herrschaft des TMC offiziell beendet, der bisherige Vorsitzende Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan wird dem Obersten Rat jedoch für die kommenden 21 Monate vorstehen.</p><p>Der Beginn der Übergangszeit dürfte daher zuvorderst für Kontinuität stehen. Abgesehen davon, dass alle jetzt in den Obersten Rat aufgestiegenen Militärs mit Ausnahme von Mohammed Hamdan »Hemedti« Daglo der früheren Nationalen Kongresspartei Al-Baschirs angehörten, steht vor allem Burhan, der sich nun wiederum selbst an die Spitze des Obersten Rates gesetzt hat, im Mittelpunkt der Kritik. </p><p>Auch der für das Massaker vom 3.

He expressed their reality, their dreams and their aspirations in his poems, his prose and the positions that he took.

Instead of using normal gas stations (which are mostly out of gas), there are young kids on motorbikes who track you down on the road and offer to fill up your car with "illegal" gasoline.
