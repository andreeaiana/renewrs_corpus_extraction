Indeed, pre-existing rivalries between groups backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE <a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/8016">have devolved into armed violence</a> before. Past cases, such as the clashes between STC and government forces in Aden in January 2018, ended swiftly after coalition mediation. </p><p>This time was different. The UAE directly supported its local ally as it moved toward goals that run counter to Saudi policy in Yemen. Saudi and Emirati commentators and intellectuals have abandoned the usual conciliatory tone that has defined public discourse between the two countries to engage in a war of words on social media. </p><p>Days after the STC’s takeover of Aden, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Emirati Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed for an emergency meeting in Mecca. The talks, which Reuters reported to be tumultuous because of tensions between the Saudi king and the Emirati crown prince, apparently did not provide any solutions. In the following days, UAE-backed forces set their sights beyond the interim capital and moved to challenge the Yemeni government in neighboring Abyan and Shabwah governorates. </p><p>Beyond the sudden and dramatic changes on the ground, the developments in the south have broader implications. The STC’s takeover of Aden undermines the legitimacy of the intervention in Yemen, with its stated objective of reinstating Hadi’s government in an undivided Yemen. The STC’s move – which would not have been possible without backing from the UAE – amounted to a second coup reminiscent of the al-Houthi takeover of Sanaa.</p><p>Disparate Motives and Contrasting Bureaucracies</p><p>When Saudi Arabia launched its military operations in Yemen in 2015, the UAE was not eager to join the coalition. At that time, its main national security concern in the region was to confront the Muslim Brotherhood. The UAE considers Hadi’s ally, the Islah party, as the Yemeni branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. </p><p>The UAE does not have the same worries; it is free to support the separatist cause, knowing that it can always pack up and go home should the southern independence project go awry. In such a scenario, Saudi Arabia would have an expansive border of sand and mountains to guard against the proliferation of potential enemies to the south. </p><p>Even if the Saudis and Emiratis had shared goals in Yemen, their disparate national security concerns and decision-making mechanisms made forging an effective partnership in Yemen nearly impossible.</p><p>From the beginning, the Saudi-UAE alliance in Yemen was unlikely to succeed. Now it has clearly failed. The second best option to having never embarked on this misguided intervention in the first place would be for the “coalition” to push for peace as hard as it pushed for war.

This risks undermining the work and credibility of these UN aid agencies, which should refuse this funding.</p><p>Even with the political manoeuvring within the UN, aid provided by UN organisations has generally been perceived as adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. These principles, which trace their origins to the ICRC, have been adopted by the UN General Assembly.</p><p>As UN agencies take funds for Yemen from coalition members, the perception of its impartiality, independence and neutrality is being eroded away.

Tasked with simultaneously tackling numerous humanitarian challenges around the world, they are desperate for funding. </p><p>Although it will be challenging from a fundraising perspective, there needs to be a rule that prevents UN agencies from accepting financing from any state directly involved in military action in a country for humanitarian activities there.</p><p>By publicly rejecting coalition funding, UN organisations might expose the coalition to greater public pressure and maybe slow down or halt the conflict – which may be the best thing these organisations can do to stop the flow of casualties – by Arslan Malik</p><p><span><a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2019/09/if-they-are-stay-impartial-un-agencies-yemen-must-reject-saudi-coalition">https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2019/09/if-they-are-stay-impartial-un-agencies-yemen-must-reject-saudi-coalition</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B E P)</strong></p><p><strong>Der Kronprinz und seine Macht</strong></p><p>Deutsche Konzerne und Manager tragen in Saudi-Arabien zur Konzentration der Macht bei dem für seine Gewaltpolitik berüchtigten Kronprinzen bei. Dies geht aus einer Analyse eines einflussreichen deutschen Think-Tanks hervor. Demnach treibt etwa der Börsengang des weltgrößten Erdölkonzerns Saudi Aramco, bei dem die Deutsche Bank eine führende Rolle spielen soll, die Zentralisierung der Wirtschaftsmacht des Landes bei dem Staatsfonds PIF voran. Dieser gilt Kritikern als ein "one-man investment vehicle" in den Händen von Kronprinz Muhammad bin Salman al Saud, das der Thronfolger nutzen kann, um seine Macht zu zementieren. Denkbar sei auch, dass der Kronprinz, der von einem früheren Siemens-Manager persönlich beraten wird, den Staatsfonds nutze, um im Ausland Einfluss zu nehmen, heißt es in einer kürzlich publizierten Untersuchung der vom Kanzleramt finanzierten Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP). Muhammad bin Salman verantwortet unter anderem den Krieg im Jemen, die Totalblockade des Emirats Qatar und mutmaßlich den Mord an dem Regierungsgegner Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>Der weltgrößte Erdölkonzern</p><p>Die Deutsche Bank soll eine führende Rolle beim Börsengang von Saudi Aramco, dem größten Erdölkonzern der Welt, übernehmen. Dies bestätigen mehrere Nachrichtenagenturen unter Bezug auf Quellen in Saudi-Arabien.[1] Demnach wird das Frankfurter Kreditinstitut gemeinsam unter anderem mit der Schweizer Großbank UBS dem Konsortium angehören, das den Börsengang organisieren soll. Als weitere beteiligte Banken werden Barclays (Großbritannien), BNP Paribas (Frankreich), andere französische und Schweizer Geldhäuser sowie diverse US-Finanzinstitute genannt.</p><p>Vision 2030</p><p>Trotz aller Risiken kommt dem Börsengang von Saudi Aramco erhebliche Bedeutung zu. Das liegt zum einen an der immensen Produktion und der gewaltigen Finanzkraft des Unternehmens.</p><p>Der Kronprinz will die Transformation des saudischen Ölstaates in eine breit aufgestellte, hochmoderne Wirtschaft vorantreiben, die es dem Herrscherclan in Riad ermöglicht, seinen Reichtum sowie seine Macht auch in der Nach-Erdöl-Ära zu sichern. Um die dazu nötigen Investitionen anzustoßen - Riad hat sie offiziell in dem Strategiepapier "Vision 2030" skizziert -, werden immense Finanzmittel benötigt.</p><p>Staatsfonds in Schlüsselposition</p><p>Berliner Regierungsberater weisen nun darauf hin, dass der PIF unter der De-facto-Herrschaft von Muhammad bin Salman im Geflecht der saudischen Staatsinstitutionen eine herausragende Position erhält: Er soll in Zukunft als zentrale Abwicklungsstelle für Riads Staatsinvestitionen fungieren. Dafür soll sein Volumen, das in der jüngeren Vergangenheit bereits mehr als verdoppelt wurde - auf rund 320 Milliarden US-Dollar -, letzten Endes zwei Billionen US-Dollar erreichen; der PIF wäre dann der größte Staatsfonds der Welt.</p><p>Ein "one-man investment vehicle"</p><p>Dies ist, wie die SWP konstatiert, nicht zuletzt deshalb von erheblicher Bedeutung, weil der PIF in höchstem Maße auf die Person Muhammad bin Salmans zugeschnitten ist und seine Aufwertung daher eine weitere "Machtzentralisierung zugunsten des Kronprinzen" mit sich bringt. Bin Salman nimmt der SWP zufolge über seine zahlreichen Ämter "massiv Einfluss auf das Tagesgeschäft des PIF", der von manchen Beobachtern "bereits als 'one-man investment vehicle' bezeichnet" wird</p><p><span>Mit deutscher Unterstützung</span></p><p>Indem die Deutsche Bank sich führend am Börsengang von Saudi Aramco beteiligt, beteiligt sie sich auch an der Machtzentralisierung zugunsten des Kronprinzen.

This emerges from an analysis of an influential German think tank. According to the analysis, the IPO of the world's largest oil company Saudi Aramco, in which Deutsche Bank is to play a leading role, is driving forward the centralization of the country's economic power in the sovereign wealth fund PIF. Critics regard this as a "one-man investment vehicle" in the hands of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman al Saud, which the heir to the throne can use to cement his power. It is also conceivable that the Crown Prince, who is personally advised by a former Siemens manager, will use the sovereign wealth fund to exert influence abroad, according to a recently published study by the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP), a foundation financed by the Chancellor's Office. Among other things, Muhammad bin Salman is responsible for the war in Yemen, the total blockade of the Emirate of Qatar and the alleged murder of government opponent Yamal Khashoggi.</p><p>The world's largest oil company</p><p>Deutsche Bank is to play a leading role in the IPO of Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company. This is confirmed by several news agencies with reference to sources in Saudi Arabia.[1] According to this, the Frankfurt bank will be a member of the consortium that is to organize the IPO, among others together with the major Swiss bank UBS. Other banks involved include Barclays (Great Britain), BNP Paribas (France), other French and Swiss financial institutions and various US financial institutions.</p><p>Vision 2030</p><p>Despite all the risks, Saudi Aramco's IPO is of considerable importance. On the one hand, this is due to the immense production and the enormous financial power of the company.</p><p>The Crown Prince wants to press ahead with the transformation of the Saudi oil state into a broad-based, ultra-modern economy that will enable the ruling clan in Riyadh to secure its wealth and power even in the post-oil era. In order to initiate the necessary investments - Riyadh has officially outlined them in the strategy paper "Vision 2030"</p><p>Sovereign wealth funds in key position</p><p>Berlin government advisors now point out that under the de facto rule of Muhammad bin Salman, the PIF is gaining a prominent position in the network of Saudi state institutions: In the future, it is to act as the central settlement office for Riyadh's state investments. In return, its volume, which has already more than doubled in the recent past - to around 320 billion US dollars - should ultimately reach two trillion US dollars; the PIF would then be the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world</p><p>A "one-man investment vehicle"</p><p>As the SWP states, this is of considerable importance not least because the PIF is highly tailored to the person of Muhammad bin Salmans and its upgrading therefore entails a further 'centralisation of power in favour of the Crown Prince'. According to the SWP, Bin Salman "exerts a massive influence on the day-to-day business of the PIF" through his numerous offices, which some observers have already described as a "one-man investment vehicle"</p><p>With German support</p><p>By playing a leading role in Saudi Aramco's IPO, Deutsche Bank is also participating in the centralization of power in favor of the Crown Prince. Alongside her, German managers support the concentration of economic influence at Muhammad bin Salman</p><p>The political dimension of economic cooperation</p><p>The SWP urges that the close economic cooperation with Saudi Arabia be reconsidered in view of the concentration of power with the Crown Prince.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/posts/2505868052799543">https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/posts/2505868052799543</a> </p><p><strong>(** B K P T)</strong></p><p><strong>Die Terror-Unterstützer</strong></p><p><span>Waffen und Munition, die nachweislich von den USA und Saudi-Arabien gekauft und bezahlt wurden, landen bei den Terroristen von Al-Qaida und IS in Syrien und dem Jemen.</span></p><p>Immer wieder wird die Aussage, dass die USA jene Terroristen, welche sie angeblich bekämpfen, selbst mit Waffen und Material versorgen, als „Verschwörungstheorie“ bezeichnet, um einer Diskussion darüber aus dem Weg zu gehen. Tatsächlich haben aber nicht nur höchste US-Beamte bereits öffentlich zugegeben, dass ihre engsten Verbündeten, Katar und Saudi-Arabien, die schlimmsten der schlimmen Terroristen unterstützt und Syrien mit Waffen überschwemmt haben, sondern es wurde ihnen bereits mehrfach die Lieferung von Waffen, Ausbildung und Material nachgewiesen.</p><p>Schon 2015 hatte Tim Anderson in seinem Buch „Dirty War on Syria“ unwidersprochen nachgewiesen, wie die USA Tausende von Kämpfern ausgebildet, bewaffnet und dann zum Kampf gegen die legitime Regierung Syriens losgelassen hatten.</p><p>Im Jahr 2017 wurde dann klar, dass diese Versorgung der Terroristen immer noch in großem Umfang stattfand, und dass wegen der Art des Transportes wohl viele Regierungen in Europa sehr wohl davon gewusst haben mussten. In einem Artikel von Rubikon (1) tauchte zum ersten Mal der Name der bulgarischen investigativen Journalistin <a href="http://dilyana.bg/">Dilyana Gaytandzhieva</a> auf, welche mit Unterlagen, die sie von Whistleblowern erhalten hatte, beschrieb, wie die Versorgung der Terroristen mit Waffen und Munition funktionierte:</p><p>„Mindestens 350 Diplomatenflüge der Silk Way Airlines (einer staatlichen Fluggesellschaft Aserbaidschans) transportierten Waffen während der letzten drei Jahre in Konfliktzonen in der ganzen Welt. Die staatliche Fluggesellschaft flog Dutzende von Tonnen schwerer Waffen und Munition für Terroristen, unter dem Schutzmantel der diplomatischen Immunität“ (1).</p><p>Nun, die Journalistin hatte für das Offenlegen der Versorgungswege ihren Job verloren, danach aber umso engagierter mit Hilfe von Whistleblowern über Biowaffenlabors und in diesem Jahr über Waffen von den USA für die Terroristen im Jemen berichtet. In einer dreiteiligen Artikelserie auf der Internetseite „Arms Watch“ berichtet sie mit vielen Details, veröffentlichten Dokumenten und Aussagen von Zeugen darüber, wie Terroristen durch die USA gestärkt werden, damit diese gegen die Huthis, welche die Marionettenregierung von Saudi-Arabien aus dem Land getrieben haben, erfolgreich kämpfen können.</p><p>Waffen für den IS in 2018</p><p>Im ersten Teil der Serie stellt Dilyana Gaytandzhieva fest, dass der US-Präsident Donald Trump zwar den Sieg über den IS in Syrien verkündet hätte, andererseits aber seltsamerweise von der US-Regierung bestellte und bezahlte Waffen in den Händen des IS im Jemen landen. Sie begründete dieser Aussage mit Dokumenten, die sie von Whistleblowern der serbischen staatlichen Waffenhersteller Krusik und Jugoimport SDPR erhalten hatte.</p><p>Unter den Dokumenten waren E-Mails, interne Mitteilungen, Verträge, Fotos, Lieferdaten und Packlisten mit Chargennummern der Waffen sowie Informationen über die Käufer dieser Waren. Außerdem Scans von Pässen der Waffenhändler und Regierungsbeamten aus den USA, aus Saudi-Arabien und den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten (VAE). Insgesamt konnten so drei Millionen Stück serbische Waffen — Mörsergranaten und Raketen — identifiziert werden, welche innerhalb der letzten drei Jahre in den Jemen und nach Syrien geliefert worden waren.</p><p>Durch die Rückverfolgung von Chargennummern der serbischen Waffen, die sich in den Händen der IS-Terroristen im Jemen befanden, konnte die Journalistin dann zurückverfolgen, dass diese von der US-Regierung bestellt und bezahlt worden waren. Der Grund für die Bewaffnung des IS im Jemen erscheint logisch: Lediglich die Huthis sind erbitterte Gegner des dortigen IS.

Even the Pentagon might be questioning, ‘what then – is the point to CentCom’ in light of what has happened? And above all, Israel will be experiencing a very chill wind sending shivers up the spine: Israelis cannot but be a tad struck in awe at the attack’s precise targeting and technical efficacy. Quite impressive – especially given that Saudi spent $65 billion on weaponry last year, to no good avail.</p><p>Facing this humiliation, the US Administration has been ‘blowing smoke’: tossing around red-herrings about the origin and launch of the UAVs and cruise missiles. ‘It can’t be <em>AnsarAllah </em>(the Houthis), because such an operation was sophisticated beyond their capabilities’. Apart from the obvious Orientalism to this assertion (for, if Hizbullah can manufacture smart drones and smart cruise missiles, why shouldn’t the Houthis be able so to do?), do the exact, individual contributions towards the strike on Abqaiq really matter? What is most telling is that the US – with all its massive resources in the Gulf – cannot provide the evidence from whence came these UAVs to Abqaiq.</p><p>Actually, the ambiguity about the strike <em>modus operandi</em> represents just another layer to the sophistication of the attack.</p><p>The US is ‘blowing smoke’ about launch sites mainly to divert from the very obvious (but embarrassing) fact that the raining down of missiles on Abqaiq, <em>primordially</em> owes to the Saudi war on Yemen (supported unreservedly by Trump). The Houthis have claimed the attack; they say they will demonstrate their weaponry (which certainly in the case of the Houthi Quds 1 cruise missile is no mere copy of the Iranian Soumar missile – see <span><a href="https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1208062/meet-the-quds-1/">here</a></span>), and promise <span><a href="https://www.raialyoum.com/index.php/will-trump-take-on-iran/">to repeat</a></span> their attacks in the near future.</p><p>What the precision strike has done is to shatter the ‘vessel’ of the US posing as somehow ‘guardian’ of the Gulf, and guarantor of the crude oil lifeblood feeding into the veins of a fragile world economy. This to say, it was a precision strike aimed at the prevailing paradigm – and it scored a direct hit. It exposed the hollowness of both claims. Anthony Cordesman <span><a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/strategic-implications-strikes-saudi-arabia">writes</a></span>, “the strikes on Saudi Arabia provide a clear strategic warning that the US era of air supremacy in the Gulf, and the near US monopoly on precision strike capability, is rapidly fading”.</p><p>Were the Iranians directly or indirectly involved? Well … it <span><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/evidence-of-irans-culpability-in-the-attack-isnt-important/">doesn’t really matter</a></span>.</p><p>There is only a political answer. But for now, the US and MbS both, are in a stage of denial: the latter apparently believes that continuing with the partial sale of Aramco might solve his problems (though markets have just re-awoken to geo-political risk to assets, such as Aramco), and Trump seems still to believe that maximum pressure might still come up trumps.</p><p>For the rest of us, ‘the political’ is pretty obvious for Saudi Arabia: Accept defeat in Yemen, and with it, its corollary – engaging with Iran and Russia is a <em>sine qua non</em> for achieving any settlement. For sure it will be costly for MbS, both politically and financially. But what is the alternative? Wait upon further Abqaiqs? To be fair, there are reports that the al-Saud understand their situation now <span><a href="https://twitter.com/mujtahidd/status/1174338379565228039">to be existential</a></span>. We shall see.</p><p>And for Trump, the lesson surely is clear. The strike on Abqaiq could have been easily worse (with greater interruption to oil supplies).

In fact, it was written by a Kafka derivative: Brussels-based European bureaucracy. The Merkel-Macron-Johnson trio, representing Germany, France and the UK, seems to know what no “ongoing investigation” has unearthed: that Tehran was definitively responsible for the twin aerial strikes on Saudi oil installations.</p><p>“There is no other plausible explanation” translates as the occultation of Yemen. Yemen only features as the pounding ground of a vicious Saudi war, de facto supported by Washington and London and conducted with US and UK weapons, which has generated a horrendous humanitarian crisis.</p><p>So Iran is the culprit, no evidence provided, end of story, even if the “investigation continues.”</p><p>Hassan Ali Al-Emad, Yemeni scholar and the son of a prominent tribal leader with ascendance over ten clans, begs to differ. “From a military perspective, nobody ever took our forces in Yemen seriously. Perhaps they started understanding it when our missiles hit Aramco.”</p><p>he confirmed: “Past Yemeni governments had missiles, but after 9/11 Yemen was banned from buying weapons from Russia. But we still had 400 missiles in warehouses in South Yemen. We used 200 Scuds – the rest is still there [laughs].”</p><p>Al-Emad breaks down Houthi weaponry into three categories: the old missile stock; cannibalized missiles using different spare parts (“transformation made in Yemen”); and those with new technology that use reverse engineering.

The latest attack on Saudi oil infrastructure has demonstrated how this conflict can spread well within Saudi borders, threatening the Kingdom and its monarchical foundation. Notwithstanding the habit of pointing fingers at Iran, the Houthi statement about the attack hasn’t just confirmed who planned and executed the attack, but also reveals how this move recieved support from within Saudi Arabia itself, a fact that scared the House of Saud much more than the damage done to its oil infrastructure. The attack shows that the monarchy is vulnerable from both inside and outside. In a situation where the Kingdom can easily be hit where it hurts most, it’s clear that political rivals from within the Kingdom can go to any extent to weaken and eventually overthrow the Saudi royal family. The Saudi war in Yemen has thus already become a double threat, an albatross around the Saudi neck that Mohammad bin Salman finds almost impossible to get rid of.</p><p>In spite of Riyadh’s attempts to point fingers at Iran, there is no gainsaying that the Houthis in Yemen have developed their military capability over the last couple of years. </p><p>An although Trump did say they were ‘locked and loaded’, the US is far from eager to take a plunge into a new war in the Middle East. Notwithstanding affirmations, the US approach is cautious and unlikely to materialize in all-out support for a possible Saudi war on Iran at a time when the Kingdom has badly failed in winning its war against the Houthis.</p><p>Washington may indeed rush for a Saudi rescue, in the words of the US president, if the Saudis can financially afford it and will be willing to foot the bill.</p><p>The Abqaiq attack has shown that the entire Middle East’s production of over 18 million barrels of oil a day – including Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia – can be easily knocked out, a possibility that regional states cannot stomach.

Explained why Patriot did not work, and why Houthi drones could stay undetected.</p><p>(* B K)</p><p>WHY PATRIOT MISSILES ARE USELESS</p><p>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rushed to defend the reputation of the Patriot system.</p><p>“Look, anytime – we’ve seen air defense systems all around the world have mixed success. Some of the finest in the world don’t always pick things up. We want to work to make sure that infrastructure and resources are put in place such that attacks like this would be less successful than this one appears to have been. That’s certainly the case,” Pompeo said during a visit to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>However, the truth is that this was not the first time that Saudi Arabia’s Patriots have failed. Over the past years, Ansar Allah has carried out dozens of successful drone and missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, targeting airports, military camps, oil infrastructure and even the Saudi capital, Riyadh. All these attacks were delivered from the ‘right direction’, but this did not help Saudi Arabia to repel them with anything that could be described as a high degree of success.</p><p>Multiple incidents involving Patriot missiles failing, malfunctioning or even returning to explode near the launch area do not add credibility to the Saudi Air Defense Forces and their Patriots. One of the most widely covered of such incidents happened on March 25, 2018, when at least 5 Patriot missiles missed, malfunctioned or exploded mid-air during the Saudi attempt to repel an Ansar Allah missile strike.</p><p>The repeated failures of Patriots to defend targets in Saudi Arabia already turned them into a meme at an international level.</p><p>It also should be noted that the Patriot was originally created to shoot down aircraft, not missiles or drones. The Patriot got the ballistic missile capability after the missile and system upgrade dubbed the PAC-2.</p><p>Another possible explanation of the inability of Saudi Arabia to protect its infrastructure from missile and drone attacks is that it lacks layered defenses that include long-range, short-range point defense systems and electronic warfare systems which are capable of repelling mixed attacks of this type.</p><p>All kinds of traditional air-defenses could struggle to repel mixed attacks massively involving relatively cheap drones and missiles.

B K P)</span></p><p><span>To End The War In Yemen, Saudi Arabia Must Put Aside Hubris And Revive Tribal Patronage</span></p><p>Saudi Arabia’s leadership needs to bring back the old Yemen hands and re-establish its influence with the tribes of northern Yemen. But before it does that it will need to first recognize the failure of its disastrous intervention- a difficult acknowledgment at a time when nationalism is being played up by the Saudi regime.</p><p>At a time when Saudi Arabia was pushing a nationalist agenda and was seeking to demonstrate its military might, diplomacy would have been considered a sign of weakness, and such calls were ignored.</p><p>In March 2018, when the Houthis launched multiple simultaneous missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, I was advising the government on the establishment of a national risk and resilience unit for the kingdom. </p><p>But while the Houthi missiles were starting to come in more regularly, the authorities did not overly worry about them, given the kingdom’s air defense systems’ apparent efficacy at intercepting them before they landed.</p><p>Through academic relations in Europe, I had naively suggested the possibility of initiating an indirect dialogue with Houthi leadership, under the assumption that backchannel communications were not already in place. Not only was the suggestion ignored, but it also led to questions as to my motivations and interests—as if trying to solve a national risk through dialogue was anathema, given the confidence that military might alone would be enough to crush an army of ragtag rebels fighting with AK47s.</p><p>Saudi Arabia can no longer afford this escalation to continue. For all his vocal support, Donald Trump is unlikely to risk a regional flare-up, and Saudi Arabia cannot afford to hit back at Iran if it turns out the attacks originated from Iranian territory. </p><p>As the first decade of the millennium was reaching its end however, two notable developments led to Saudi Arabia losing its grip on the north of Yemen. </p><p>Despite a significant loss of Saudi institutional memory on Yemeni affairs and a fratricidal war that has torn apart Yemen’s tribal and social fabric, there is a desperate need for Saudi Arabia to reimpose its influence. While it is understood that MBS’s brother Khaled is now in charge of the Yemen dossier, it is urgent to bring back the prominent Saudi experts who played an active role in the Special Committee.</p><p>For this to succeed, it will be fundamental for Saudi Arabia to guarantee the Houthis a place in the future government of Yemen and commit to reconstructing the civilian infrastructure that has been destroyed. Saudi Arabia will also need to provide guarantees that it will not support the establishment of Salafi schools in the Zaydi heartland of northern Yemen, while in return the Houthis will need to commit to stopping their cross-border attacks, and more importantly end their relationship with Iran and its affiliates – by Nicolas Dunais, an independent advisor to GCC governments on matters of economic development and security. </p><p><span><a href="https://lobelog.com/to-end-the-war-in-yemen-saudi-arabia-must-put-aside-hubris-and-revive-tribal-patronage/">https://lobelog.com/to-end-the-war-in-yemen-saudi-arabia-must-put-aside-hubris-and-revive-tribal-patronage/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H K)</span></p><p><span>A war crime.

Hospitals lack basic medicines and basic supplies such as oxygen and fuel for generators. Fuel and oxygen are usually available in the local market, but hospitals can rarely buy it."</p><p><span><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/171948">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/171948</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p><span>The Military Officials Who Knew Saudi Arabia Would Fail</span></p><p>Privately they've been saying for years that Riyadh can't win in Yemen and that we shouldn't have given the Houthis up.</p><p>While it’s seems axiomatic that most Americans suffer from historical amnesia, that’s not necessarily true for the U.S. military. And as America and Iran were sprinting towards a military confrontation last week, a recently retired senior U.S. military officer expounded on what he called “the bumbling, incompetent and feckless stupidity of it all.”</p><p>The target of the officer’s ire was not Donald Trump (whom he admires) or Mike Pompeo (who he doesn’t), but Saudi Arabia’s March 2015 decision to go to war against the Iranian-allied Houthi tribal movement in Yemen —“which is,” he argues, “how all of this nonsense got started in the first place.”</p><p>He explained: “We didn’t see the [Saudi] invasion [of Yemen] coming and we were shocked when it happened. But we were pretty blunt. We told them, ‘you can’t win and you’ll bankrupt your country. It’ll be a quagmire.’ And we were right.” </p><p>This officer’s “we-told-ya-so” narrative, as it turns out, is accurate.</p><p>“The Houthis were only nominally Iran’s surrogates,” a military officer told me at the time, “but they were also our quiet partners against al-Qaeda.” Yet back in 2015, because of the Saudi invasion (with support from nine other Arab states), the possibility that the Pentagon could count on Houthi backing was not only off the table, senior Pentagon officials predicted that the tribe would strengthen its ties with their Shia co-religionists in Iran—something that, prior to the Saudi invasion, it hadn’t wanted to do. That’s why key segments of the U.S. military thought the Saudi invasion was a mistake. </p><p>But that’s not how Senator John McCain saw it. McCain defended the Saudi invasion, linked it to Barack Obama’s decision to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, and said there was good reason that the Saudis had kept their planned intervention a secret.</p><p>Senior U.S. military officers scoffed at this, even as, given McCain’s stature as the arbiter of all-things-military, they kept their views private. “The reason the Saudis didn’t inform us of their plans,” a U.S. Central Command officer told me at the time, “is because they knew we would have told them exactly what we think—that it was a bad idea.”</p><p>“You know that popular map that you see on Twitter that shows that Iran is surrounded by U.S. bases?” the Pentagon civilian asks rhetorically. “Well, guess what? The Iranians have now surrounded Saudi Arabia. And so while we’ve ratcheted up the economic pressure, <a href="https://www.juancole.com/2011/12/iran-has-us-surrounded-all-right.html">they’ve decided to do the same</a>. Last week’s message was loud and clear—if we can’t market our oil, we’re going to make damn sure you can’t market yours.” </p><p>Left unsaid, but implied in this assessment, is what the official was careful not to say: that despite all of America’s saber rattling and Mike Pompeo’s bluster, the U.S. is playing an increasingly weak military hand—and it’s only getting weaker – by Mark Perry</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-military-officials-who-knew-saudi-arabia-would-fail/">https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-military-officials-who-knew-saudi-arabia-would-fail/</a></span></p><p>My comment: Perry thinks Iran had committed the Aramco attacks.

That unification also meant the ancient Ottoman province of Yemen was split in two. The northern half was now part of Saudi Arabia while the southern portion, containing prosperous cities like Sanaa and Hodeida became North Yemen. This split the Yemeni Shia Arab population in half. Three decades later the growing oil wealth of Saudi Arabia meant the Saudi Shia tribes on the Yemen border were better off economically than their Yemeni kinsmen. The reduced enthusiasm for reuniting the Yemeni Shia. There was no such oil wealth in Yemen and the Yemeni Shia felt the Sunni majority were taking more than their fair share of what little oil income Yemen produced.</p><p>When the British left in the early 1960s, as part of a widespread abandonment of colonies by European nations, there was some unrest and fighting in the newly independent South Yemen. This was because Aden was much less religious and traditional with a better educated population and it was no surprise that Aden and some other South Yemen cities were dominated by local communists. From 1970 until the fall of European communism in 1989, South Yemen was a communist state, subsidized by the Soviet Union, and the only such one in the Arab world.</p><p>Most of that enthusiasm for communism was centered in Aden and its suburbs. This is where most of the South Yemen population lived and where an even larger proportion of its GDP came from. A few other coastal cities had the same type of population and political attitudes, giving the urban population control of politics as well as the economy. The tribal minority, out in the desert and semi-desert inland areas was much more religious and traditional. But over the centuries the urban and tribal populations had learned to get along and respect each other’s customs.</p><p>It was different in northern Yemen, where the urban population was not as dominant and the tribal population was economically better off and about as religious and conservative as their southern counterparts. The problem was the northern and southern tribes saw each other as “foreigners”. This is a common situation in tribal cultures, which includes the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. Yet even then there was some enthusiasm for a united Yemen in the north and south.</p><p>With the collapse of the Soviet Union (and European communism) in 1991 the Russian subsidies stopped and unification was suddenly much more appealing. After a few years of haggling, and occasional fighting, Yemen was united by 1994. At that point there were still factions in the north and south who believed unity was overrated and two Yemens was the way to go.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.strategypage.com/qnd/yemen/articles/20190925.aspx">https://www.strategypage.com/qnd/yemen/articles/20190925.aspx</a></span></p><p>My comment: My comment: A large article, looking like a broad overview, but spilled with propaganda.

This, to the many in Yemen who celebrated the Aramco attack, is sufficient justification for targeting the heart of Saudi Arabia’s economy.</p><p>Unlike the burning fields of neighboring Saudi Arabia, in Yemen scenes of massive fires have become commonplace, a reality that civilians do not accept but have come to expect. </p><p>The Coalition is estimated to have carried out at least 42 airstrikes in just a 24-hour period alone. By 2 a.m. on Sunday, local residents in the al-Sawad district of North Amran were living in horror as they sheltered in schools and mosques hoping to escape death from above as at least 12 Coalition airstrikes leveled their neighborhood. Thekra, Moamer, and Kubra — three young girls between the ages of three and eight — were among those who took refuge in a local mosque, only to be killed after Saudi warplanes brought it down over their heads. </p><p>In the village of al-Addi in the Harf Sufyan district, the air was suffused with the smell of charred bodies after a Saudi airstrike hit a car, instantly killing the two civilians inside. That attack was followed hours later by airstrikes targeting the nearby home of Ahmed Jimaie.</p><p>On Tuesday, 16 civilians, including four women and seven children, were killed when Saudi airstrikes hit the home of Abbas al-Halmi in Qataba, Al-Dali governorate.</p><p>Saudis blame Iran, punish Yemen</p><p>The Grand Mufti of Yemen, Shams al-Din Sharaf al-Din, the highest religious authority in Yemen, laid blame on those who declared solidarity with Saudi Arabia following last week’s Aramco attacks but remain silent in the face of atrocities committed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Yemen.</p><p>These latest Saudi-led Coalition attacks came days after Yemen’s Houthis announced responsibility for a spate of retaliatory attacks against positions inside Saudi Arabia. It is unclear why the Coalition launched the ostensibly retaliatory attacks on Yemen, as they claim that it was Iran, not the Houthis, that carried out the oil-field attacks. </p><p>Many Yemenis see Aramco attack as justified last line of self-defense</p><p>For many, the Houthis’ setting fire to the Kingdom’s Aramco oil fields represented the last hope to quell Saudi attacks on Yemen. In a staggering show of solidarity on Sunday, an estimated 1,200 cars filled the streets of 70th Area, a neighborhood in southern Sana’a, to drop off food donations for families of victims of Saudi airstrikes. According to many of the families, the attack on Aramco is revenge for the blood of the estimated 100,000 <a href="https://www.acleddata.com/2019/06/18/yemen-snapshots-2015-2019/">people killed</a> in the Saudi-led Coalition’s war in Yemen.</p><p>Indeed, the Coalition has used systematic economic strangulation as a weapon of war</p><p>However, many still doubt that the Houthis were capable of carrying out an attack of the scale and range of the one that struck Saudi Arabia — instead accusing Iran of orchestrating the attacks. Others await the results of an international investigation, but the Houthis, who comprise a major component of Yemen’s resistance to Saudi interference in their country, say the evidence that they carried out the attacks exists and that they will share it with the media.</p><p>The Houthis over the past two years have launched a series of sophisticated attacks on Saudi coalition targets deep inside the Kingdom, establishing a precedent for the most recent attacks – by <span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/author/ahmed-abdulkareem/">Ahmed Abdulkareem</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/saudi-arabia-blame-iran-aramco-strikes-retaliate-bombing-yemen-civilians/262051/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/saudi-arabia-blame-iran-aramco-strikes-retaliate-bombing-yemen-civilians/262051/</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Yemen to become Saudis’ Vietnam: ex-Iranian diplomat</p><p>Hamid Reza Asefi, a former Iranian diplomat, has said Saudi Arabia’s war on Yemen will go on and Yemen will become the Saudis’ Vietnam.</p><p>One of Riyadh’s options is to concede defeat “but this would cost the Saudis dearly, given that they should then accept their political and military mistakes and I don’t see this in [Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad] bin Salman’s small head,” Asefi said in an interview broadcast on TV on Monday night.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/440483/Yemen-to-become-Saudis-Vietnam-ex-Iranian-diplomat">https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/440483/Yemen-to-become-Saudis-Vietnam-ex-Iranian-diplomat</a></span></p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p>[Aden] Yemeni Govt.

The supply of urea, seeds and fuel is particularly scarce in Aden, Hodeidah and Al Baidha governorates, while high input prices are reported across the whole country. High fuel prices are constraining agricultural activities, particularly those related to irrigated crops, with consequent increases in the share of rainfed crops which, in turn, bear lower yields. Hired agricultural labour tends to be replaced by unskilled family labour to cope with the increased costs of production. By replacing hired labour by family labour, livelihoods of many landless rural households relying on casual labour opportunities as their main source of income are imperilled.</p><p>Well below-average cereal harvest in 2019</p><p>Taking into account conflict-related constraints as well as outbreaks of pests, total cereal production in 2019 is forecast at 385 000 tonnes, about 12 percent below the previous year’s harvest and over 30 percent below the five-year average.</p><p>On average, total domestic cereal production covers less than 20 percent of the total utilization (food, feed and other uses). The country is largely dependent on food assistance and commercial imports to satisfy its domestic consumption requirement for wheat, the main staple. The share of domestic wheat production in total food utilization in the last ten years is between 5 to 10 percent, depending on the domestic harvest.</p><p><span><a href="http://www.fao.org/giews/countrybrief/country.jsp?code=YEM">http://www.fao.org/giews/countrybrief/country.jsp?code=YEM</a></span></p><p>(* B H K)</p><p>Air strikes maim, scar Yemen's children</p><p>Ismail Abdullah kicks a makeshift football, wrapped in pink plastic, with his right foot.

Optimism that the presence of the Saudi-led coalition would prevent a separatist conflict in southern Yemen has given way to the reality that such a conflict has now begun. Multiple armed factions are now active in the region, including pro-government forces, STC fighters, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.</p><p>Outside players are fueling the crisis. The UAE stands by the STC, while Saudi Arabia backs the Yemeni government</p><p>The UAE’s support for the STC stems in part from its fear that the Islamist Islah Party has gained considerable clout within the Yemeni government and may wind up in control of the country if and when the civil war ends. But this is not the only thing motivating the Emiratis. Southern Yemen is home to considerable natural resources, including oil, and is strategically located at the junction of the Red and Arabian seas. The UAE is keen to maintain its influence in this critical part of the world and views the separatists as loyal clients who will reliably support Abu Dhabi’s interests.</p><p>The Saudis, by contrast, view the Yemeni government as a loyal client and their best chance to reestablish Yemen’s pre-war political order and contain the Houthi threat on the kingdom’s southern border. Southern secession would potentially leave the Houthis in a much stronger position and therefore would be antithetical to Saudi war aims.</p><p>Divergent Ambitions</p><p>The people of southern Yemen are far from unified in their feelings about independence.

Such a situation will have spillover effects on the peace efforts in Yemen, complicating efforts to reach a political settlement to its civil war.</p><p>Today, a considerable number of southerners feel that independence from the north is a stepping stone to stability and prosperity in in the south.

In my forthcoming book <span><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/monsters-to-destroy-9780190061463?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">Monsters to Destroy: Understanding the War on Terror</a></span>, I argue that the US has long guaranteed the security of the kingdom. In exchange, the Saudi royals agreed to recycle substantial amounts of their oil profits to the US in the form of bank deposits and purchasing American treasuries. These inflows of US dollars allow American interest rates to remain low, even as the US runs a considerable trade and budget deficit. How does this benefit Americans? Lower interest rates allow US citizens to borrow cheaply to purchase homes, cars, education, and to start businesses. Without access to these inflows, it is possible that both the US government and its citizens would have to spend less and save more, all while paying higher taxes and raising interest rates. In short, the status quo where the US protects the Saudis and the Saudis recycle their profits provides substantial benefits for both sides.</p><p>However, as I argue in my book, this financial gain provided to Americans comes with a price. If the US wants to continue enjoying this relationship, it must provide the Kingdom with permanent protection. Already, Saudi concerns about the US’s ability to do so are growing. </p><p>The destruction of the Abqaiq facility may call the value of this security guarantee into further doubt. In this case, even though the US has a clear interest in protecting the kingdom’s oil infrastructure, it was unable to. </p><p>Raising doubt about Saudi stability at this point can only benefit the Iranians, harm the Saudis, and indirectly harm the US.</p><p>Although these scenarios sound bleak, there are a few reasons to believe that all may be well. </p><p>However, in the long term, this should not make Americans too comfortable. <span><a href="https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/International/The-Saudi-Pivot-To-The-East-Is-Real.html">The Saudis are already beginning to look east as far as their energy sales</a></span> are concerned. They are also increasingly viewing the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/watch-putin-and-saudi-crown-prince-mbs-exuberant-handshake-at-g-20.html">Russians as a potential partner rather than an adversary</a>. Further, <span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/15/saudi-arabia-dramatically-changing-its-oil-exports-to-china-and-the-us.html">China is now their biggest purchaser of oil</a></span>. If the US cannot provide security, these other states that are aligned with Iran might be able to broker a peace in Yemen.

The war on Yemen will have been raging for four and a half years this week.

It Needs to Stop.</p><p>The September 14 attack on Saudi oil facilities—an attack the United States, Britain, Germany and France all say Iran carried out—demonstrates how close the Middle East is to war. But the focus on Iranian aggression must not obscure Saudi Arabia’s own role in the worsening situation, including its disastrous involvement in the civil war in Yemen. Rushing to provide U.S. military support to Saudi Arabia now will send the absolute wrong signal to Riyadh, whose conduct over the past few years has damaged America’s global standing and threatened our security.</p><p>Congress is considering whether to end U.S. backing for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. It should suspend U.S. arms sales and other support for the coalition not only to help end the horrific conflict, but to make clear that Saudi Arabia must take steps to avoid a broader regional conflagration.</p><p>During my tenure, I faced a Saudi government in denial that 15 of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi citizens and blind to the threat religious extremism posed to both of our countries.

If Congress fails to act, U.S. arms will kill more innocent civilians in Yemen as the chance for peace dwindles, impunity for Khashoggi’s murder will embolden tyrants around the world, and the war in Yemen will continue empowering terrorists and destabilizing an already risky region – by Robert W.

The Houthi of Yemen are not, that is, a tribe of cave-dwellers badly in tools that delude themselves to resist the most prepared Saudi and Western armies but disciplined soldiers full of ardor, experts of modern warfare and who can get remarkable results with the means that have available.</p><p>The astonishment that the Western chancelleries caught after the success of the Yemeni attack against ARAMCO installations makes us understand how the West in crisis overestimates itself and insists on looking at the rest of the world with the air of sufficiency of those who have not understood which turn the events really took.</p><p>The Saudi Arabia war against the Yemenis is a dirty proxy war on behalf of the United States, part of the Middle East remodeling planned well before 9/11 and started immediately after the 2001 attacks on American soil. To pay the price of this madness, which had and still has as its final target the destruction of Russia and the confinement of China, were the populations of once prosperous countries like Libya, Syria and Iraq that end up in the meat grinder of endless civil wars.</p><p>It is worth remembering once again how the Houthi attack has shown how difficult, if not impossible, to defend the thousands of kilometers of pipelines that cross the Saudi desert. The war against Iran, the war that the hawks of the American Deep State want strongly with their Israeli friends, would therefore not be a quiet morning walk but something full of terrible unknowns.</p><p>The West has few people trying to counter the insane and endless madness of American <em>neocons</em>. One of them is the Republican Richard Black, Virginia State Senator.</p><p>Senator Black cannot tell where exactly the drones that hit Saudi oil installations came from but they certainly not came from Iran.</p><p>In the end, the American people are tired of war, tired of the constant war that lasts for eighteen years.

It is targeting strategic objectives in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf in response to the US unilateral sanctions that followed US withdrawal from the nuclear deal known as JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action). Iran aims to send multiple messages across borders to Saudi Arabia above all, and to the United States of America. Tehran is selecting, from its bank of objectives, specific targets whereby it is gradually increasing the damage and maximising the impact on its enemies.</p><p>The latest Houthi attack against Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities required months of preparation due to its multi-purpose objectives. According to a well-informed source, “Iran has been testing – via the Houthis in Yemen – the US and Saudi Arabia’s weak defensive systems to find a hole since May this year when an Aramco facility was hit for the first time. The Houthis sent many drones to different parts of the country over the past five months. This was tactical reconnaissance to test radar capabilities and the safest route for hitting crude oil exports and forcing the end of the war in Yemen.</p><p>The attack on Saudi oil sent multiple messages: it showed the strength of Iran’s partners in the Middle East, ready to offer a plausible deniability by Iran when needed. It revealed a stage for Iran to hit its enemies. </p><p>The difference of attitude and support towards allies is enormous. Iran has managed to build a trustworthy chain of allies acting as a single body while the US bullies and humiliates its allies, most recently the Kings of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, while blackmailing these and other Arab leaders to buy US weapons.</p><p><span>In one way or another, US foreign policy and regime change plans have significantly contributed to consolidating this “Axis”, allowing Iran to take advantage of the US failure in many parts of the Middle East.</span></p><p><span>The Middle East is indeed suffering from the US-Iranian tension. It is hitting energy resources and navigation safety on tankers, and nobody can exclude an escalation that leads to an unwanted and “unplanned” war.</span></p><p><span>There will be no peace in the Middle East as long as the US illegal sanctions on Iran are in force. In fact, no peace can be reached at all as long as the US forces maintain a military presence in the Middle East, acting as a bully and an occupation force rather than a partner – by E. J.

Lindsey Graham and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after last week’s attack on two Saudi oil facilities.</p><p>President Trump likely understands that a US war on Iran will be his undoing as president. Who knows, maybe that’s what his closest advisors want. But according to a Gallup poll just last month, only 18 percent of Americans were in favor of military action against Iran.</p><p>The message to Trump is pretty clear – war with Iran would be deeply unpopular - and it seems clear he understands the message.</p><p>Unfortunately, with pressure on President Trump to “do something” even as Iran has not been found to have been behind the attack, the president has settled on two measures - one pointless and the other dangerous. On Friday Trump announced yet even more sanctions on Iran, leaving many of us to wonder what is possibly left to sanction. He also announced a deployment of US military forces to Saudi Arabia of a “defensive nature.” Why should the military be sent to “defend” one of the wealthiest and most repressive countries on earth? It is hard to see how putting US servicemembers into harm’s way – into a war zone – to defend Saudi Arabia can in any way make America great again. I believe most Americans would agree.</p><p>Attempting to placate the neocons is a fool’s errand, because they are never satisfied even up to and including war.

The surplus covers all Yemeni regions without exception.<br /> The World Food Program had revealed that it has provided aid to some 12.4 million people throughout Yemen in August, including nine million in regions controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi militias.<br /> This is the highest figure achieved by the agency since the eruption of the crisis in Yemen.<br /> Aljetaily said: “This is the goal KSRelief has been seeking to achieve since its establishment.
