The strike killed six people and injured eight. In its findings, of which there is no written report available, the JIAT blamed the incident on “a projectile malfunction that led to a deviation from the target”, and recommends “voluntary assistance on casualties and material damage”.</p><p><span><a href="https://arhp.msf.es/sites/default/files/160502%20MSF%20Internal%20report%20on%20Razeh%20attack%20-%20external.pdf">MSF’s own investigation into the incident</a></span>, completed in March 2016, concluded that there was no justifiable or legitimate reason for the attack, as the hospital remained protected in line with international humanitarian law, including in cases of error and negligence.</p><p>Such a finding from the JIAT highlights the failure of parties to the conflict in Yemen to take the necessary measures to ensure that protected medical facilities are not hit. It also follows a depressingly predictable pattern in which accountability is dodged by blaming either the victims of an attack or malfunctions that relieve the SELC of any culpability.</p><p>In another press conference held in January 2019, the JIAT attempted to shift responsibility for a <span><a href="https://www.msf.org/report-bombing-msf-facility-unacceptable-and-contradictory-abs-yemen">June 2018 strike</a></span> by the SELC onto MSF, falsely accusing the organisation of failing to take the appropriate steps to avoid being targeted. The strike resulted in the near total destruction of a newly-established Cholera Treatment Centre in Abs, which had been due to serve a catchment population of more than one1 million people.</p><p>Despite repeated calls by humanitarian actors for credible investigations into such events, the JIAT has consistently failed to report promptly and transparently on its findings, leaving both humanitarian agencies and individual victims of SELC attacks with no recourse to justice or accountability. Its recommendation in this instance for the provision of “voluntary assistance” amounts to a vague, inadequate pledge that comes three years too late.</p><p>Attacks that violate international humanitarian law – such as those that target protected medical facilities and civilian sites (like the <span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/09/middleeast/yemen-bus-intl/index.html">2018 bombing of a school bus</a></span> and the <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/01/red-cross-says-more-than-100-killed-in-air-strike-on-yemen-prison">2019 strike on a prison in Dhamar</a></span>) – are routinely perpetrated with impunity by all parties to the conflict in Yemen, and result in injury, death and displacement for the civilian population.</p><p>Such strikes not only have direct consequences for those who lose their lives or are injured in the attacks: they also impact the population by preventing humanitarian actors from doing their jobs, thereby and thus reducing the availability of critical humanitarian aid, even as needs continue to soar.</p><p>MSF facilities have been hit five times by SELC airstrikes since March 2015. With only half of health facilities in Yemen fully functional, more than 11 million people in acute need, and outbreaks of cholera and other easily preventable diseases occurring regularly across the country, access to medical facilities is crucial for the civilian population.</p><p>MSF reiterates once again the urgent need for truly independent investigations, conducted in a transparent and timely manner and resulting in shared, written reports that enable real accountability. MSF also calls on all parties to the conflict to urgently take the necessary steps to respect the neutrality and protected nature of the humanitarian medical mission, and to avoid damaging or destroying medical facilities and the loss of civilian lives.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.msf.org/yemen-hospital-bombing-investigation-findings-too-little-too-late">https://www.msf.org/yemen-hospital-bombing-investigation-findings-too-little-too-late</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/idmc">Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre</a>: UnSettlement: Urban displacement in the 21st century - Yemen: Urban displacement in a rural society</strong></p><p>War and displacement in Yemen are not primarily urban in nature. Despite the amount of media attention given to key urban battles such as the siege of Taiz and the battle for Hodeidah, the disaggregation of data on incidents of conflict and displacement by type of location shows that 68 per cent of the former and 69 per cent of the latter take place in rural areas. This is in line with the rural nature of the country’s population.</p><p>Rural to rural and urban to urban displacement are the dominant patterns of movement. The importance of having social networks in areas of displacement and transferable education and skills cannot be overemphasised. The war has also rendered typical pull factors to cities, such as access to basic services and livelihood opportunities, all but irrelevant, meaning that rural to urban displacement is not as common as it might otherwise have been.</p><p>Despite the impacts of war, internally displaced people (IDPs) in urban areas still have better access to basic services than their rural counterparts.</p><p>Access to water and electricity was poor in urban areas before the war, and even worse in rural areas. The war has only widened such gaps across sectors and the country as a whole. Rural inhabitants, including IDPs, are forced to travel long distances to access markets and health and education services, a costly and time-consuming endeavour that urban IDPs do not face.<br /> Understanding pre-war trends, particularly the decline of rural life and the spread of informal settlements on urban peripheries, will be key in developing solutions to displacement. Urban IDPs join the ranks of the broader urban poor, living in areas where water and electricity supplies and sanitation are all but absent. Deteriorating rural conditions led to rural to urban migration before the war, and this is certain to increase as the conflict aggravates rural decline and leaves IDPs from rural areas nowhere to return to. Developing tailored local solutions that include the integration of urban IDPs into the urban economy will help mitigate the impacts of displacement on individuals and the urban ecosystem as a whole.</p><p>This paper examines the urban and rural characteristics of displacement in Yemen, including the push and pull factors in both areas. It provides an overview of historical urbanisation trends in the country, and a ruralurban disaggregation of large conflict and displacement datasets from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) and International Organization for Migration (IOM), respectively.</p><p>It examines rural and urban displacement patterns and assesses host conditions and the status of basic services in urban centres. It looks specifically at conditions in the cities of Taiz and Aden as they create internal displacement and shelter IDPs. It also analyses future intentions and preferences for durable solutions along urban and rural lines.</p><p>More than 80 interviews were conducted with internally displaced families in Aden, Lahj, Sana’a and Taiz governorates in August and September 2019.</p><p>More than half of the interviewees were living in urban centres, particularly the cities of Taiz and Aden which are the focus of this study. It also draws on 40 interviews conducted with Yemeni refugees in Europe and Djibouti in May and June 2019, many of whom were also from Aden and Taiz. National and international service providers working in the two cities were interviewed for triangulation and clarification purposes.</p><p>Yemen’s war has caused economic opportunities in cities to shrink, basic services to break down and prices to soar, rendering many of the usual draws to urban areas irrelevant. Rural to urban displacement has not been a prevalent pattern of movement as a result. The traditionally rural nature of Yemeni society is a further significant factor</p><p>Last-resort hosting sites also tend to be in rural areas, which potentially acts as a draw for the most vulnerable IDPs. Respondents interviewed for this study, however, placed great importance on the relevance of their education, skills and social networks in areas of displacement, these factors acting as the primary pull to new locations.</p><p>Cities have played a key role in Yemen’s conflict, and not only as theatres of war and power struggles from which hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced. Despite their limitations as a result of the conflict, they have also served as relatively safe havens for people displaced from both rural and other urban areas and have continued to provide better access to services for its residents.</p><p>Given the country’s pre-war urbanisation trends and the steady decline of rural life before the war, increasing rural to urban migration and displacement is inevitable. As Yemeni cities still offer better access to basic services and livelihood opportunities for skilled workers and professionals than rural areas, they will be pivotal to the country’s recovery and future development.</p><p>Given people’s general preference for sustainable support, especially in the form of establishing or re-establishing livelihoods, despite the emergency context, there is a need to reconsider different types of approaches to assistance. Cities, in particular, provide an opportunity to pilot new approaches, in which urban IDPs, along with the urban poor living on the peripheries, are integrated into the cities’ economies in a sustainable way so as to reduce the impacts of displacement on future urbanisation and development.</p><p><span><a href="http://www.internal-displacement.org/publications/yemen-urban-displacement-in-a-rural-society">http://www.internal-displacement.org/publications/yemen-urban-displacement-in-a-rural-society</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong>For migrants, stopover in Yemen often means rape and torture</strong></p><p>“What will they do to us?” Zahra thought.</p><p>This story is part of an occasional series, “Outsourcing Migrants,” produced with the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.</p><p>She and 300 other Africans had just endured six hours crammed in a wooden smuggling boat to cross the narrow strait between the Red Sea and the gulf. When they landed, the traffickers loaded them into trucks and drove them to ramshackle compounds in the desert outside the coastal village of Ras al-Ara.</p><p>There was Zahra’s answer. She was imprisoned for a month in a tin-roofed hut, broiling and hungry, ordered to call home each day to beseech her family to wire $2,000. She said she did not have family to ask for money and pleaded for her freedom.</p><p>Instead, her captors raped her. And they raped the 20 other women with her — for weeks, different men all the time.</p><p>“They used each of the girls,” she told The Associated Press. “Every night there was rape.”</p><p>With its systematic torture, Ras al-Ara is a particular hell on the arduous, 900-mile (1,400 kilometer) journey from the Horn of Africa to oil-rich Saudi Arabia. Migrants leave home on sandaled feet with dreams of escaping poverty. They trek through mountains and deserts, sandstorms and 113-degree temperatures, surviving on crumbs of bread and salty water from ancient wells.</p><p>In Djibouti, long lines of migrants descend single file down mountain slopes to the rocky coastal plain, where many lay eyes on the sea for first time and eventually board the boats. Some find their way safely across war-torn Yemen to Saudi Arabia, only to be caught and tossed back over the border. The lucky ones make it into the kingdom to earn their livings as a servant and laborers.</p><p>But others are stranded in Yemen’s nightmare — in some measure because Europe has been shutting its doors, outsourcing migrants to other countries.</p><p>Meanwhile, more than 150,000 migrants landed in Yemen in 2018, a 50% increase from the year before, according to the International Organization for Migration.</p><p>This year, more than 107,000 had arrived by the end of September, along with perhaps tens of thousands more the organization was unable to track — or who were buried in graves along the trail.</p><p>And European policies may be making the Yemen route more dangerous. Funded by the EU, Ethiopia has cracked down on migrant smugglers and intensified border controls. Arrests of known brokers have prompted migrants to turn to unreliable traffickers, taking more dangerous paths and increasing the risk of abuses.</p><p>Many of those migrants end up in Ras al-Ara.</p><p>Nearly every migrant who lands here is imprisoned in hidden compounds while their families are shaken down for money. Like Zahra, they are subjected to daily torments ranging from beatings and rapes to starvation, their screams drowned out by the noise of generators or cars or simply lost in the desert.</p><p>“Out of every thousand, 800 disappear in the lockups,” said a humanitarian worker monitoring the flow of migrants.</p><p>Traffickers who torture are a mix of Yemenis and Ethiopians of different ethnic groups. So victims cannot appeal to tribal loyalties, they are tortured by men from other groups: If the migrants are Oromia, the torturers are Tigrinya.</p><p>The AP spoke to more than two dozen Ethiopians who survived torture at Ras al-Ara. Nearly all of them reported witnessing deaths, and one man died of starvation hours after the AP saw him.</p><p>The imprisonment and torture are largely ignored by Yemeni authorities. The AP saw trucks full of migrants passing unhindered through military checkpoints as they went from the beaches to drop their human cargo at each desert compound, known in Arabic as a “hosh.”</p><p>“The traffickers move freely, in public, giving bribes at the checkpoints,” said Mohammed Said, a former coast guard officer who now runs a gas station in the center of town – by Maggie Michael (with photos)</p><p><span><a href="https://apimagesblog.com/blog/migrants-endure-sea-crossing-to-yemen-and-disembark-in-hell">https://apimagesblog.com/blog/migrants-endure-sea-crossing-to-yemen-and-disembark-in-hell</a> = (few photos only) <a href="https://apnews.com/476e15db8b77486e9d157b33f9494b22">https://apnews.com/476e15db8b77486e9d157b33f9494b22</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/nation-world/world/article236806643.html">https://www.thestate.com/news/nation-world/world/article236806643.html</a></span><span> = </span><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/migrants-stopover-yemen-means-rape-torture-191030073625125.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/migrants-stopover-yemen-means-rape-torture-191030073625125.html</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span>Torture awaits African migrants traveling in Yemen</p><p>Thousands of African migrants, ushered to Yemen by smugglers, find themselves in the particular hell of Ras al-Ara.

The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has told us that the number is now 11 personnel, who are believed to be based at the unit’s headquarters in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.</p><p>The British government has repeatedly <span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568294/57525_Cm_9353_PRINT_v0.3.pdf/#page=8">told</a></span> parliament that all UK military personnel in Saudi Arabia “remain under UK command and control”. An MOD spokesman further told us: “The British Military Mission is commanded by a British officer, who reports directly to the Ministry of Defence, in London.”</p><p>However, new information suggests that the chain of command on the ground is different.</p><p>‘Members of the Saudi National Guard’</p><p>The British embassy in Riyadh admitted in 2012 that the UK military officers involved in the mission “take their orders directly from His Royal Highness, Prince Miteb bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, Cabinet Minister and Head of the Saudi Arabian National Guard”. Prince Miteb, the son of the late King Abdullah, was head of the SANG until 2017.</p><p>The admission came in an internal embassy publication, called Kingdom to Kingdom, intended for distribution within government. The British embassy even referred to the British soldiers as “members of the Saudi National Guard”, rather than advisers or trainers.</p><p>When presented with the document, the MOD told us the information is misleading.</p><p>However, we have also seen a 1983 document from the MOD entitled “Directive for the commander, British Military Mission to Saudi Arabian National Guard” stating that while the commander is formally answerable to the chief of defence staff in the UK, “members of BMM will ordinarily obey the orders of designated SANG superiors”.</p><p>Our understanding is that, although the formal chain of command may end in London, these British military personnel report on a day-to-day basis to their Saudi superiors, who are their effective commanders.</p><p>The MOD has also informed us that BMM SANG is a “loan service personnel” scheme.

Al-Jubeir claimed that “Iran’s hand is in almost all countries in the region… Iranians are on a rampage and have been on a rampage since 1979″ and that there is an ‘Iran Problem’ — its support of terrorist groups, its ballistic missile program and its destabilizing effect in the region and unless we deal with those problems, “we will always have an Iran problem as they keep on meddling in the internal affairs of other countries.”</p><p>Al-Jubeir said the Iran poses problems when it comes to the internal affairs of other countries, so is he talking about Syria who its President, Bashar al-Assad has invited not only Iran but also Russia to help fight the Islamic State? Let’s go back to 2011, during the start of the Syrian conflict which began as an uprising against the Assad government, there were U.S. backed moderate rebels and members of ISIS and other terrorist groups that came from Iraq, Libya and elsewhere who infiltrated the demonstrations.</p><p>Professor Tim Anderson, a Senior Lecturer in Political Economy at the University of Sydney and an author of several books including ‘The Dirty War on Syria: Washington, Regime Change and Resistance’ and ‘Daraa 2011: Syria’s Islamist Insurrection in Disguise’ described how the Syrian civil war actually began:</p><p>The US-Saudi Alliance: Supporting Terrorists One Step At A Time</p><p>Investigative journalist, Seymour Hersh published ‘The Red Line and the Rat Line’ in the London Review of Books in April 2014 where he interviewed an anonymous former pentagon official who claimed that the U.S. diplomatic post located in Benghazi, Libya existed for the purpose of sending weapons through a secret pipeline to the Syrian rebels who were fighting Syrian government forces. Hersh elaborated on the Obama administration’s role in sending weapons from Libya through Turkey and finally into the hands of the terrorists or the moderate rebels within Syria’s borders:</p><p>That’s just one side of the story. The majority of fighters that made their way into Syria were trained and armed in Jordan by the CIA and other Western intelligence agencies under <em>‘Operation Timber Sycamore’</em> that began in 2011 and supposedly lasted until 2013 according to the mainstream media. The pipeline to ISIS was through Saudi Arabia according to a September 2016 report by <em>The New York Times ‘U.S. Relies Heavily on Saudi Money to Support Syrian Rebels’</em>:</p><p><span>Iran is also guilty in the attacks on the Aramco oil facility according to Saudi Arabia.</span></p><p>However, Saudi Arabia itself has been involved in a relentless bombing campaign in Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Middle East since March of 2015. </p><p>The U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia are the destabilizing factors in the Middle East.

Maeen, 43, an Aden resident who fought with the Yemeni government against the STC in August 2019, said the separatists' many opponents in the south do not dare to speak.</p><p>“I believe that the STC will not continue as it imitates the Houthis in all behaviours and marginalisation is the most dangerous one, as we cannot demand our rights,” Maeen said. </p><p>“The STC represent not the south but [only] itself and we are waiting for the Saudi-led coalition to leave Yemen and to liberate the south from the new dictators,” he added.</p><p>Residents suspect violence is brewing</p><p>Though the warring sides have claimed that they seek peace and the Jeddah agreement promised to deliver it, Aden's residents are less hopeful. </p><p>Ridhwan Qasim, 39, said dialogue and concessions are required from both sides but until now, he has only seen signs of more violence. </p><p>“New Saudi tanks and armoured vehicles arrived in Aden over the last two days and the pro-Hadi forces are gathering in Shabwa, waiting for the government to direct them to attack Aden, is that a signal of peace?” Qasim told MEE.</p><p>The agreement has failed to deliver peace in his view, only confirming the change of leadership in the city. </p><p>“The pro-Hadi people in the south did not welcome the Jeddah agreement as they think the STC won the battle, so clashes can break out anytime in the coming months,” Qasim said.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/southern-separatists-accept-saudi-forces-yemen-government-not-welcome-0">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/southern-separatists-accept-saudi-forces-yemen-government-not-welcome-0</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia’s quick fix of Yemen’s southern conflict will face a durability problem</strong></p><p>The deal recognizes the STC as a political entity, which is a welcome change for the group as the state and its loyalists have vilified it in the aftermath of recent clashes in South Yemen. The STC will be part of Yemen’s government delegation in its political pursuit of a solution to end the Houthi problem.</p><p>The parties went into this agreement with different intentions. For the Saudis, their mediation was meant to set aside any political or military disputes until after the conflict with the Houthis is resolved. For the government of Yemen, it aimed to reinforce its authority over southern lands after facing violent confrontations and loud calls for disunity. As for the STC, its objective was twofold: first, to be seen as a legitimate Yemeni political force worthy of respect, and second, to open diplomatic channels with Saudi Arabia that would grant it the same privileges and access that Yemen’s government has with Riyadh.</p><p>The relationship between the STC and the government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has been <span><a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/monday-briefing-fighting-flares-southern-yemen">challenging and confrontational</a></span>.</p><p>Within this context, the deal reached circumvented a violent disintegration of Yemen into two states, which, although unfavorable, seemed inevitable. While the issue of secession could potentially resurface in the future, the deal has effectively taken disunity off the table. The STC is now obligated to cooperate under the umbrella of a joint coordination committee, which the Saudis will also take part in, until there is a resolution to the Houthi problem that faces North Yemen.</p><p>Although the agreement reached in Riyadh is imperfect, it provides enough assurances for all parties as they made significant concessions and a collaborative plan.</p><p>Indeed, there is a reason to be skeptical about the agreement given the lack of political leadership and willingness to resolve the southern issue without the need for regional or international mediation. The government of Yemen had long refused to acknowledge the STC as a political authority and often sought to discredit it by painting it as a UAE proxy and establishing competing southern groups, such as al-Eitilaf, with the aim of reducing the STC’s monopoly on the South. </p><p>However, there are three things in the agreement worthy of mentioning that, if implemented as intended, could turn things around and deepen an alliance between the government and the STC. First, the STC will have a significant say in the way the southern region is governed</p><p>Second, there are disarmament and redeployment components that should stop both parties from utilizing their resources and manpower against each other.</p><p>Third, the management of state resources will go beyond the exclusive control of the state, as the deal stipulated depositing all government revenues, including those from extractive sector industries and taxes, in the Central Bank of Aden.</p><p>The Riyadh agreement undoubtedly presents the STC with a governance challenge. Besides its ability to provide security through the Security Belt Forces and security establishments, the STC does not have sufficient expertise in running other state institutions. </p><p>Moreover, the agreement is drafted in a way that assumes that all parties are working toward the goal of maintaining a unified Yemeni state, which does not reflect reality. Nor does it address the need to build national identity or horizontal cohesion between members of society and the state in order to foster the unified outcomes it seeks.</p><p>For the time being, the deal represents a quick fix that gives all parties what they need for now – by Fatima Abo Alasrar</p><p><span><a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/saudi-arabias-quick-fix-yemens-southern-conflict-will-face-durability-problem">https://www.mei.edu/publications/saudi-arabias-quick-fix-yemens-southern-conflict-will-face-durability-problem</a></span></p><p><strong>(** A P)</strong></p><p><strong>Peter Salisbury: So, the Riyadh Agreement (RIP, Jeddah Agreement) between STC and Hadi gov still hasn't been signed</strong> but a ceremony is reportedly imminent and a draft of what is the near-final text has now been distributed widely. Some quick thoughts</p><p>Draft is made up of a series of cascading/staggered national / local political and security arrangements aimed at integrating STC/southern secessionist political and affiliated forces into national defence/security structures. In return, STC participates in UN-led consultations.</p><p>If successful, the agreement solves two short-term problems: - It prevents a war-within-a-war between STC and Hadi government - It provides more credibility to future government negotiating platform with the Huthis. Great!</p><p>But... It also displays many of the hallmarks of past troubled political deals in Yemen. It puts a lid on a serious issue (GoY-STC divisions over future of south), and arguably kicks the can down the road. It is loosely worded, and open to interpretation....</p><p>.. And sets an ambitious timeline for implementation (new government, new southern governors, new southern security / military structures, within 3 months) without substantive detail of how these things will happen. In particular, sequencing and benchmarking are absent.</p><p>This last point (sequencing/benchmarking) seems to be the final issue in getting the agreement signed. Are military / security restructuring and gov't formation separate processes, or does the former have to happen before the latter? Unclear.</p><p>Still no news either on who will be PM, interior or defence minister. Each likely to be an important predictor of success as is the committee formed to oversee implementation. Big test for Saudi Arabia, which is taking over as Coalition lead in the south and will manage process.</p><p>For STC deal allows them to pursue agenda (independence) at UN-led talksas internationally legitimised actor . For GoY, is a re-assertion of sovereignty. The two have a history of enmity and clashing agendas. A lot could go wrong. GoY/STC contacts expect it will be short-lived.</p><p>If successfully implemented the agreement could lead to A) UN-led negotiations building on ongoing KSA-Huthi talks or B) A fresh offensive on Huthi-held territory by consolidated, Saudi-overseen anti-Huthi bloc. Would hope the former, but suspect the latter just as likely.</p><p>There is a lot to play for, a lot of reasons to be cautiously hopeful and a lot of reasons to be worried about risks of collapse. The Saudis are now very much in the driving seat. Will be up to them to fit the jigsaw together.</p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/peterjsalisbury/status/1188891831704182785">https://twitter.com/peterjsalisbury/status/1188891831704182785</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>The South Yemen Peace Deal Is A Pragmatic Step Towards Self-Determination</strong></p><p>The South Transitional Council (STC) will receive domestic and international legitimacy for its separatist cause after entering into a reported power-sharing agreement with Hadi's government as part of a peace deal aimed at ending the ambiguity over South Yemen's political status following the group's dramatic liberation of Aden in August.</p><p>On the surface, it therefore appears as though the reported peace deal that was agreed to last week between the STC and the Hadi government is a step backwards for the former since its <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/draft-saudi-brokered-deal-aims-south-yemen-power-struggle-191026164026978.html">terms</a></span> include surrendering control of the city to the national government, thus scaling back the enormous on-the-ground progress that they made in their separatist quest over the the past two months. Nevertheless, it's important not to lose sight of the fact that the agreement actually bestows domestic and international legitimacy to the movement's cause by decreeing that "Southerners are to be given 50 percent of ministerial roles within a period of 45 days from the signing of the agreement". This advances the goal of institutionally restoring Yemen's regional identity that was peacefully erased following their 1990 unification and then militantly enforced after the North's victory in the brief civil war that erupted in 1994 in an attempt by the South to reverse this decision upon feeling as though their counterparts took advantage of them and their resources during the intervening four years. This outcome wouldn't have been made possible had it not been for the August events, so it should still be seen as a step forward for the overall cause.</p><p>Without the UAE's full support (held back partially out of concern that it would make the emerging rift with Saudi Arabia irreconcilable and thus create a strategic opening for the Ansarullah), the STC was unable to liberate the rest of South Yemen, hence why it was compelled to compromise. Hadi, however, was also compelled to compromise as well by agreeing to the terms that recognize the STC as a legitimate political stakeholder in the country. This therefore puts the country on the path towards what may be its inevitable federalization back into its constituent Northern and Southern halves as part of an eventual peace deal between all sides that could potentially be mediated by Moscow. It's difficult to think of any other realistic solution to the stalled campaign that's failed to dislodge the Ansarullah from the North despite causing the world's worst humanitarian crisis in pursuit thereof, though the devil is obviously in the details and much more work would have to be done in that respect before Saudi Arabia would ever agreeing to anything like that. Still, thus far, the STC has made considerable progress in gaining domestic and international legitimacy.</p><p>The very fact that the STC is being legitimized is an unprecedented political development that gives rise to hope that a related formula might eventually be worked out for the Ansarullah to as part of a "grand compromise", but there's still a ways to go before that happens – By Andrew Korybko</p><p><span><a href="http://oneworld.press/?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;id=1139">http://oneworld.press/?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;id=1139</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>How Does Southern Yemen Peace Deal Affect War Course?</p><p>The agreement comes while the previous round of negotiations in Saudi Arabia failed as the two sides’ deep differences sustained. This time the Saudi efforts seem to have yielded results. But what is the Saudi aim behind the push for the agreement and what are its implications on future developments? </p><p>After nearly 5 years of war, National Salvation Government, led by Ansarullah, proved a success in the management of the course of developments amid unceasing war</p><p>Saudi Arabia has now sustained a defeat and sooner or later it has to admit this through announcing the end of the war. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is deeply worried about an exit from Yemen without an achievement, seriously seeks a way to split Yemen to at least realize part of his goals for which he started the aggression. </p><p>Taking control of the strategic Bab-el-Mandeb Strait using a secessionist agenda of the southerners was part of his goals. Additionally, Yemen partition will materialize the Saudi goal of cutting independence on the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz for oil transportation. Saudi Arabia plans an oil pipeline from its territories to Yemen’s Al Mahra province to transfer oil to Sea of Oman for shipment. The pipeline and a port have been negotiated for decades with various Yemeni governments. </p><p>Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to allow Saudi companies to build the pipeline and port in the country’s territories. The escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf over the past year pushed the Saudis to seek alternatives to oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. </p><p>The considerable issue is that just contrary to the past in which Hadi, at least ostensibly, insisted on the unity of the country and was not inclined to make compromises to the separatists, the new agreement will recognize the armed separatists as a legitimate force, giving Hadi’s green light to split of the country. </p><p>Boosting Riyadh’s military and political position </p><p>Brokering a deal between the resigned government and the STC, from another aspect, is part of Saudi Arabia’s efforts to beat the huge challenges it is facing on the battlegrounds. As the UAE separated its ways from the Saudis and the southerners declined to fight Ansarullah in the north, Riyadh sustained big defeats.</p><p>By pushing forward the deal, Saudi Arabia is hopeful of strengthened position against Ansarullah in any negotiations.</p><p><span><a

Panoramashots über die Wüste, durch die Berge, über das Meer. Nahaufnahmen von Menschen, Lachen, Tanzen, Staunen, Hände, Hufe, Muscheln, Tee. Ein Sprecher raspelhaucht über Teppichen aus Synthiemusik von „versteckten Schätzen“ und „atemberaubender Schönheit“. „Wo in der Welt könnte das nur sein?“ Na klar, in Saudi-Arabien, dem neuen Touristenparadies. </p><p>Das Video ist Teil der PR-Strategie des Kronprinzen bin Salman. Wochenlang lief es als Werbung vor vielen Videos auf Youtube in Deutschland. Bin Salman verspricht immer wieder, Saudi-Arabien zu mordernisieren und zu öffnen, seit September dürfen nun auch ausländische Touristen ganz offiziell ins Land. </p><p>Um diese wirbt nicht nur Saudi-Arabien selbst in aufwendigen Onlinespots.

Lal besuchte Saudi-Arabien im März. Auf Instagram beschrieb sie ihre Eindrücke mit Hochglanzfotos und Postkartensprüchen wie: „Wir sehen die Welt nicht wie sie ist, sondern wie wir sind.“ </p><p>Eingeladen hatte Lal die Agentur Gateway KSA, die sich eine NGO nennt, aber doch durch staatliche Unternehmen und Mitglieder der Königsfamilie finanziert und verantwortet wird.</p><p>Neben dem Tourismus öffnet sich Saudi-Arabien auch für Akademiker aus dem Ausland. Auch darum kümmert sich Gateway KSA. </p><p>Studenten aus dem Ausland können sich bei der Agentur für eine zehntägige Reise ins saudische Königreich bewerben, all inclusive. Bewerben sollen sich vor allem „Influencer, politische Entscheidungsträger und Führungskräfte von morgen“, also Studierende von Prestigeuniversitäten wie Harvard oder Princeton, Yale oder Oxford.

Dies betrifft auch lebenswichtige Medikamente und medizinische Ausrüstung. Zwar sind humanitäre Importe von den Sanktionen der US-Regierung ausgenommen, aber diese Ausnahmen erweisen sich in der Praxis als wirkungslos. US-amerikanische und europäische Unternehmen und Banken befürchten Sanktionen und rechtliche Schritte, wenn sie eigentlich nicht von den Sanktionen betroffene humanitäre Güter exportieren und finanzieren. Dadurch verliert die iranische Bevölkerung Zugang zu lebenswichtigen Medikamenten und ihr Recht auf Gesundheit wird beeinträchtigt. Völkerrechtliche Bestimmungen verpflichten die USA dazu, die Auswirkungen ihrer Sanktionen auf die Menschenrechte der iranischen Bevölkerung zu prüfen und bei Beeinträchtigungen Abhilfe zu schaffen.</p><p>„Mitarbeiter der Trump-Regierung behaupten, sie stünden an der Seite der Iraner. Aber das viel zu weitreichende und belastende US-Sanktionsregime verletzt das Recht der Iraner auf eine angemessene Gesundheitsversorgung, etwa den Zugang zu lebenserhaltenden Medikamenten“, sagt <span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-leah-whitson">Sarah Leah Whitson</a></span>, Leiterin der Abteilung Naher Osten bei Human Rights Watch. „Wegen des lückenlosen Sanktionsnetzes der USA nehmen Banken und Unternehmen auch vom humanitären Handel mit dem Iran Abstand. Iraner mit seltenen oder komplexen Erkrankungen erhalten nicht mehr die Medikamente und die Behandlung, die sie brauchen.“</p><p>Zwischen November 2018 und Oktober 2019 befragte Human Rights Watch 21 Personen, darunter iranische Ärzte, ehemalige und aktuelle Mitarbeiter iranischer und internationaler Arzneimittelimporteure sowie Anwälte und Nichtregierungsorganisationen mit Fachkenntnis über humanitäre Maßnahmen im Iran. Einige Befragte leben im Iran, viele lebten entweder bislang im Iran und/oder reisen regelmäßig dorthin, leben aber in einem anderen Land. Zudem befragte Human Rights Watch Experten für US-Regierungspolitik, die direkt oder indirekt mit dem Iran befasst sind. Auch flossen Aussagen mehrerer Iraner in den Bericht ein, die sich in sozialen Netzwerken darüber beklagt hatten, keine Medikamente für sich oder Familienangehörige mehr bekommen zu können. Einbezogen wurden auch die verfügbaren offiziellen Stellungnahmen der US-amerikanischen und der iranischen Regierung. Außerdem analysierte Human Rights Watch Wirtschafts- und Handelsdaten der iranischen Zentralbank, der iranischen staatlichen Gesundheitsorganisation Sazman-e-Ghaza-va-Daroo und von Eurostat, der Statistikbehörde der Europäischen Union mit Sitz in Luxemburg.</p><p>Seit die US-Regierung im Mai 2018 offiziell aus dem internationalen <span><a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/JCPOA-at-a-glance">Atomabkommen</a></span> ausstieg, reaktivierte sie zuvor ausgesetzte Wirtschaftssanktionen unter anderem auf den Öl-Export und erließ weitere Sanktionen. Das US-Finanzministerium <span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm541">prognostizierte</a></span>, dass die Sanktionen zu zunehmender finanzieller Isolation des Irans und zum wirtschaftlichen Stillstand führen würden. „Sanktionen, die so umfassend sind wie die der Trump-Regierung und auf unbestimmte Zeit erlassen werden, wirken sich negativ auf die humanitäre Versorgung von Millionen Iranern aus. Zudem beeinträchtigen sie deren Recht auf Gesundheit“, sagt Human Rights Watch.</p><p>Die Wirtschaftssanktionen verursachen trotz der humanitären Ausnahmen unnötiges Leid bei Iranern, die unter unterschiedlichen Krankheiten und Beeinträchtigungen leiden. Am stärksten betroffen sind Iraner mit seltenen Krankheiten, die besonderer Behandlung bedürfen und ihre bisherigen Medikamente und Versorgung nun nicht mehr erhalten. Dazu zählen unter anderem Patienten mit Leukämie, Epidermolysis bullosa (EB, eine Hautkrankheit), Epilepsie und chronischen Augenkrankheiten, die von chemischen Kampfstoffen im Iran-Irak Krieg verursacht wurden.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/de/news/2019/10/29/iran-sanktionen-gefaehrden-gesundheit">https://www.hrw.org/de/news/2019/10/29/iran-sanktionen-gefaehrden-gesundheit</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Human Rights Watch: Maximum Pressure:’ US Economic Sanctions Harm Iranians’ Right to Health.</strong></p><p>Though the US government has built exemptions for humanitarian imports into its sanction regime, broad US sanctions against Iranian banks, coupled with aggressive rhetoric from US officials, have drastically constrained Iran’s ability to finance such humanitarian imports. The consequences of redoubled US sanctions, whether intentional or not, pose a serious threat to Iranians’ right to health and access to essential medicines—and has almost certainly contributed to documented shortages—ranging from a lack of critical drugs for epilepsy patients to limited chemotherapy medications for Iranians with cancer.</p><p>At the core of the harmful knock-on effects of renewed US sanctions on Iran is that in practice, these sanctions have largely deterred international banks and firms from participating in commercial or financial transactions with Iran, including for exempted humanitarian transactions, due to the fear of triggering US secondary sanctions on themselves. As a result, Iranians’ access to essential medicine and their right to health is being negatively impacted, and may well worsen if the situation remains unchanged, thereby threatening the health of millions of Iranians.</p><p>On several occasions, US officials have indicated that the pain US sanctions are causing for ordinary Iranians is intentional, part of a strategy to compel Iranian citizens to demand their autocratic government to “change behavior” – a recipe for collective punishment that infringes on Iranians’ economic rights. For instance, on February 14, 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CBS News, "Things are much worse for the Iranian people [with the US sanctions], and we are convinced that will lead the Iranian people to rise up and change the behavior of the regime.” The US Treasury Department itself predicted that US policies would lead to Iran’s “mounting financial isolation and economic stagnation.” </p><p>The Trump administration, beyond re-imposing economic sanctions that had been suspended under the JCPOA, has repeatedly targeted Iranian financial institutions. On October 16, 2018, for example, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Treasury Department further restricted Iran’s access to global financial markets by adding about 20 Iranian institutions to the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) for “supporting military force that recruits and trains child soldiers.”</p><p>These restrictions on financing, combined with the sharp depreciation of the Iranian currency, the rial, have resulted in severely limiting Iranian companies and hospitals from purchasing essential medicines and medical equipment from outside Iran that residents depend upon for critical medical care. Moreover, renewed US sanctions have directly impacted families’ purchasing power, contributing to inflation rates of around 30 percent in the past year. Iran’s nearly universal health care coverage currently absorbs a significant portion of health care costs. But the failure of this system, which is already under serious financial stress, will likely have devasting effects on millions of patients.</p><p>In July 2019, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran said that he is “not only concerned that sanctions and banking restrictions will unduly affect food security and the availability and distribution of medicines, pharmaceutical equipment and supplies, but is also concerned at their potential negative impact on United Nations and other operations and programs in the country.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch found that current economic sanctions, despite the humanitarian exemptions, are causing unnecessary suffering to Iranian citizens afflicted with a range of diseases and medical conditions. Some of the worst-affected are Iranians with rare diseases and/or conditions that require specialized treatment who are unable to acquire previously available medicines or supplies. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/10/29/maximum-pressure/us-economic-sanctions-harm-iranians-right-health">https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/10/29/maximum-pressure/us-economic-sanctions-harm-iranians-right-health</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>US State Department Prepares Budget to Counter Tehran’s Regional Activities</p><p>David Schenker, assistant secretary for the US State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, told the Congress that 2020’s fiscal year budget will focus primarily on countering Iran's influence.<br /> He said Iran is a “provocative and malicious player” that threatens US allies and intervenes in the affairs of Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and other regional countries.<br /> In a session held by the House Foreign Affairs’ Middle East and South Africa Subcommittee, Schenker said the US administration’s strategy on Iran primarily focuses on “neutralizing Iran's destabilizing influence and constraining its malign activities, particularly in support for terrorism and militants.”<br /> “Strong diplomatic, economic and security measures must be bolstered by US assistance programs that support key partners and seek to deny access and influence to Iran and its proxies,” he stressed.<br /> “Resources requested in this budget will counter Iran’s malign influence in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen by working through our local partners.”</p><p><span><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1968826/us-state-department-prepares-budget-counter-tehran%E2%80%99s-regional-activities">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1968826/us-state-department-prepares-budget-counter-tehran%E2%80%99s-regional-activities</a> </span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Iran’s FM: US Attempts to Exclude Iran from Any Regional Arrangement Futile</p><p>US attempts to exclude Iran from any regional arrangement futile: FM Zarif</p><p>Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has lashed out at the United States for pursuing a policy aimed at isolating the Islamic Republic in the region, saying such attempts are futile.</p><p>Zarif, who is in Qatar to attend the annual Munich Security Conference (MSC), made the remarks in an exclusive interview with the Doha-based television network <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/zarif-push-isolate-iran-region-work-191029131323291.html">Al Jazeera</a></span> on Tuesday.</p><p>He said Washington’s policy of excluding Iran “from any regional arrangement - whether in Syria, Afghanistan or Yemen - will just not work,” once again emphasizing that US sanctions against Iran have “failed.”</p><p>He also described as “unacceptable” Saudi Arabia’s similar attempts to isolate Iran, Turkey and Qatar from regional security equations, saying, “We all have to come together” in the face of such isolationist agendas.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/10/29/609894/Zarif-Al-Jazeera-MSC-Doha-Qatar-JCPOA-Saudi-Arabia">https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/10/29/609894/Zarif-Al-Jazeera-MSC-Doha-Qatar-JCPOA-Saudi-Arabia</a></span></p><p><span>(A P T)</span></p><p>US propaganda on Baghdadi’s death aims to undermine efforts of Resistance Axis: IRGC</p><p>A ranking IRGC commander said that Washington aims to play down the role of Resistance Axis in fighting terrorism in the region.</p><p>“ISIL has been defeated by regional nations and the Resistance Axis and Americans aim to question the role of Resistance in the fight against terrorism and say that ‘we are the one undermining ISIL and fighting terrorism’, but this is not the case,” Brigadier General Ism</p><p><span><a href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/151700/US-propaganda-on-Baghdadi-s-death-aims-to-undermine-efforts-of">https://en.mehrnews.com/news/151700/US-propaganda-on-Baghdadi-s-death-aims-to-undermine-efforts-of</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>IRANISCHE BEDROHUNG: ISRAELISCHE BOTSCHAFTEN IN ERHÖHTER ALARMBEREITSCHAFT</span></p><p>Zahlreiche israelische Botschaften haben angesichts der wachsenden Bedrohung durch den Iran ihre Sicherheitsvorkehrungen verstärkt.

It represents the other half of the picture of threats that until now had not been revealed to the public. Military intelligence officials warned last month of the possibility that Iran would try to attack Israel from Western Iraq by launching cruise missiles or drones from bases it established in the area with the assistance of Shi’ite militias that it operates. It seems that the second scenario relates to Yemen. Tehran provided Houthi rebels there with drones and Scud missiles, which it has used in the last few years to <span><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/saudi-arabia-says-drone-attacks-halt-half-its-oil-supplies-u-s-blames-iran-1.7842155">attack airfields and oil facilities</a></span> in Saudi Arabia. Now, according to Netanyahu’s speech, long-range ballistic missiles have been added to the Iranian arsenal in Yemen.</p><p>Because the distance between northern Yemen and Eilat, the southernmost point in Israel, is over 1,800 kilometers, it is possibly the type known as <span><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran-successfully-test-launches-new-ballistic-missile-1.5452798">Khorramshahr</a></span>, derived from the North Korean Musudan missile</p><p>Iranian missiles can reach Israel from Iran itself, of course.

Hassan Al-Moallem expressed his appreciation to the Government of Saudi Arabia for their support of this program and the support of Yemeni scholars, especially in the circumstances that Yemen is going through.<br /> He also thanked the Minister of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance, Dr. Abdullatif Al-Sheikh, for his efforts in sponsoring the program.<br /> Al-Moallem pointed to the practices of the Iranian-backed Houthi terrorist militia that target the depth of Yemeni society by poisoning ideas and changing the right approach of society, stressing that the role of Scholars is to fight perverted
