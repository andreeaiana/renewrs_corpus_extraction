Yes "tens and thousands"—that's how the civilian casualties in Yemen is presented by the media because no accurate data is available. Why? The UN stopped updating the death toll in Yemen in 2017 when it had reached 10,000 fatalities. Independent research organisations though have tried to keep track of the casualty figures and estimates range between 60,000 and a couple of lakhs.</p><p>According to a UN report in early 2019, by the end of the year the death toll in Yemen was estimated to have been 233,000, or 0.8 percent of Yemen's population of nearly 30 million—102,000 lives lost to conflict while another 131,000 to diseases. 2019 has ended but we do not know for sure how many have died so far. And this is just one of the tragedies of Yemen.</p><p>While the dead are gone and are finally at peace, it is the living who are suffering: from hunger, from the pain of losing their loved ones, from the wounds of conflict, often wishing to join the dead.</p><p>The UN has termed the situation in Yemen "the world's worst humanitarian crisis". And why not? According to the UN, 10 million people in Yemen are on the brink of famine and 80 percent of the population are in need of aid.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/closer-look/news/yemens-collateral-damage-1871623">https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/closer-look/news/yemens-collateral-damage-1871623</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1 Am wichtigsten / Most important</span></h2><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>The STC has again suspended its participation in implementing the Riyadh Agreement</strong></p><p>The Southern Transitional Council (STC) has halted its participation since early February in the military and security committees formed to implement the Riyadh Agreement, a source informed on the implementation of the agreement told Almasdar Online. The UAE-sponsored separatist body had previously suspended then resumed its engagement in the implementation committees, but the latest halt comes as unprecedented tensions have emerged between the STC and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The agreement now hangs in the balance, as many of the stipulated deadlines have passed without implementation on the ground. Moreover, one of the few milestones achieved – the return of Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed to the interim capital of Aden – was put into doubt as he left to Riyadh last week amid heightened tensions between government and STC-aligned forces.</p><p>The committees that the STC has suspended its participation in relate to the military and security components of the Riyadh Agreement, while the political component is being handled directly by the lead delegates of the Yemeni government and STC. These three components of the agreement are interrelated. The committees on the ground are supposed to be overseeing the crucial reforming of the security and military sectors, and there is unlikely to be progress on the political aspects of the agreement until that happens, which is why the prime minister left to Riyadh. </p><p>One of the most contentious points surrounding the implementation of the security and military annexes of the Riyadh Agreement is the repositioning of military forces, particularly from Shaqra area in Abyan, where President Hadi has strong loyalists in close proximity to Aden. On February 8, STC-aligned security forces in Aden <span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/344">prevented</a></span> government forces from relocating to Lahj governorate, demanding the withdrawal of a separate unit in Shaqra. This came despite earlier agreement between the two parties during a meeting sponsored by the commander of the Saudi forces in Aden. </p><p>The show of force by pro-STC forces prompted an escalation in the rhetoric used by supporters of the STC, with a number of prominent separatists directly accusing Saudi Arabia of supporting the “northern regime” and “terrorist” leaders in Aden. The following day, the STC issued a statement stressing its keenness to have a strong partnership with the coalition, particularly Saudi Arabia. However, dozens of STC supporters demonstrated in front of the Saudi-led Coalition headquarters in Aden, and tensions remained heightened. Saudi Arabia has since deployed significant reinforcements of military equipment to Abyan and Shabwah governorates, where government forces are stationed.</p><p><span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/385">https://al-masdaronline.net/national/385</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>The UAE may have withdrawn from Yemen, but its influence remains strong</strong></p><p>Although the UAE’s withdrawal has provided an exit strategy from the stalemate in Yemen, it neither suspends Abu Dhabi’s role in the coalition nor curtails Emirati influence on the ground. The bedrock of the UAE’s “<span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-emirates/uae-troop-drawdown-in-yemen-was-agreed-with-saudi-arabia-official-idUSKCN1U31WZ">Peace First</a></span>” strategy is a switch from direct to indirect engagement in the country through increased reliance on local proxies and partners, as the deputy chief of staff of the UAE’s armed forces, Lt. Gen. Eisa Saif al-Mazrouei, recently <a href="https://wam.ae/en/details/1395302822487">reiterated</a>.</p><p>Direct engagement</p><p>Before its phased withdrawal strategy — initially <span><a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/uae-drawdown-yemen-welcome-step-it-needs-be-reciprocated">introduced</a></span> as a military drawdown in July 2019 — the UAE publicly and directly fought two primary enemies: first, the Houthis as part of the Arab coalition, and second, violent extremist groups, most notably al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and ISIS, with the U.S.</p><p>In countering the second threat of violent extremism, the UAE <span><a href="https://pomed.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Dawsari_FINAL_180201.pdf">pushed</a></span> AQAP out of the port city of Mukalla in 2016 using a combination of peaceful and coercive tactics, and it also trained local units, most notably the Security Belt Forces (SBF).</p><p>Interestingly, the UAE, according to al-Mazrouei, has also combated a third enemy: “the Muslim Brotherhood and their fifth column.” While this might not be surprising given the UAE’s well-known hostility toward political Islamist groups more broadly, and the Muslim Brotherhood in particular, the question is when such a motive became prominent. Most likely, the April 2016 appointment of Lt. Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar — who is widely <span><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/yemens-second-in-command-may-have-a-second-coming">perceived</a></span> to be pro-Muslim Brotherhood — as the <span><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2016/4/5/ousted-yemeni-pm-rejects-unconstitutional-sacking-by-yemeni-president">replacement</a></span> for Vice President Khaled Mahfoudh Bahah, who was a consensus figure locally, regionally, and internationally, prompted the UAE to reassess its Yemen policy.</p><p>Instead of speeding up its withdrawal, the UAE strategically laid the groundwork for its indirect engagement, along the lines of Libya, by creating an array of counterbalancing local forces — <span><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/5/16/gcc-aden-based-southern-transitional-council-doomed-to-fail">including</a></span> the Southern Transitional Council (STC) in May 2017. These forces weakened the rule of the Yemeni government in the liberated territories, diverted the coalition’s focus from fighting the Houthis to fighting the Houthis and Islah, and, consequently, created intra-coalition divisions as a result. </p><p>Indirect engagement after phased withdrawal</p><p>Five years on, the UAE has control over several non-state armed groups, thought to total <span><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/01/why-the-united-arab-emirates-is-abandoning-saudi-arabia-in-yemen/">around 90,000 fighters</a></span> across the liberated territories, which it supports by providing direct training, capacity building, logistics assistance, and salaries.</p><p>By formalizing the STC as an active Yemeni player through the conclusion of the <span><a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Riyadh-Agreement-between-the-legitimate-government-and-the-Southern-Transitional-Council-sk-converted.pdf">Riyadh Agreement</a></span>, Abu Dhabi ensured that its southern proxy would have a legitimate role in the country’s future prior to completing its withdrawal.</p><p>Implications of Emirati withdrawal</p><p>The UAE’s withdrawal has significant implications for the trajectories of both the conflict and the peace process. First, the UAE’s military withdrawal, coupled with the <span><a href="https://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article68850#forum418054">significant</a></span> Sudanese drawdown from more than 15,000 to just over 650 personnel, will further isolate Saudi Arabia in Yemen, thus increasing the external pressure on the kingdom. </p><p>Second, the Yemeni government has become more fragile not necessarily as a result of the UAE’s withdrawal per se, but primarily because of the inheritance Abu Dhabi left behind: local groups in possession of heavy weapons and mixed ambitions with contested territorial control.</p><p>Third, the Saudi-led coalition now officially has competing wings that are fighting different battles against several enemies, including each other, ultimately benefiting the Houthis. </p><p>Fourth, Abu Dhabi is highly likely to continue counterterrorism engagement, in cooperation with the U.S. and local proxies on the ground, given that it, according to Mazrouei, has not officially suspended its membership in the coalition, for symbolic and security reasons.</p><p>Fifth, the UAE will remain an important player in conflict resolution efforts, considering its close ties with the armed factions it supports across the liberated territories. While the UAE’s withdrawal will help to mollify its international critics and partly repair its damaged reputation, Abu Dhabi will retain significant influence with the STC, the political umbrella group bringing together several armed factions in the south.</p><p>Therefore, it is clear that the UAE’s withdrawal will not reduce its influence in Yemen for the foreseeable future. Abu Dhabi will continue be important to the trajectories of both the conflict and the peace process, especially given its patron-client relationship with the entities its sponsors — a dynamic that is itself unlikely to change in the short to medium term.

SAM said Al-Saleh Prison became a nightmare in the city of Taiz which is known for education and the rejection of racism and weapons before Houthis’ siege since the beginning of 2015.</p><p>SAM described Al-Saleh Prison as a horror-held prisoner and resembled it to Palmyra in Syria and Bastille in France.</p><p>SAM monitored the inhumane treatment detainees face, such as starvation, denial of hygiene, denial of ventilation and the sun.</p><p>SAM said that the Houthis detain the victims for a number of purposes, including punishment of opponents, forced recruitment, or hostages in exchange for fighters being held among their members, and against ransom to be paid by the detainees' families.</p><p>SAM stated that it had previously monitored more than 51 private prisons in the governorate of Taiz, including 29 prisons run by the Houthis militia, 9 prisons run by government forces, 9 private prisons run by forces loyal to the Emirates on the west coast, and 4 prisons for extremist militant organizations that the government forces closed it in 2018 after controlling its neighborhoods and residential buildings, where the militants were deployed.</p><p>According to the SAM report, secret and illegal prisons were a disturbing phenomenon in Yemen, where "parties to the conflict" are creating illegal and secret prisons to disappear opponents and retaliate against them.</p><p>SAM monitors incidents of human rights violations and addresses victims of illegal prisons and torture in particular. It previously issued a report entitled “What is Left for Us” that documented the suffering of women in Houthis’ militia prisons, and another report entitled “Slow Death” which highlighted violations suffered by sick detainees in the prisons of Houthis militia, and monitored the illegal detention sites run by the militia, as well as the violations committed by the Emirates and its militias in the southern governorates, and investigated the bombing of detainees in the military police building in Sana'a by the Saudi-Emirati Coalition air force, and issued a report entitled "Common Crime", SAM also, monitored the most important illegal detention centers of the Emirates in the southern governorates and called for their immediate closure.</p><p><span><a href="https://samrl.com/l.php?l=e,10,A,c,1,76,79,3810,html">https://samrl.com/l.php?l=e,10,A,c,1,76,79,3810,html</a></span></p><p>and full report: <span><a href="https://samrl.org/pdf/455Sam%20Report%20%20Al%20SalehEnglish.pdf">https://samrl.org/pdf/455Sam%20Report%20%20Al%20SalehEnglish.pdf</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B E P)</strong></p><p><strong>Legalized looting: Houthis increasingly tax populace to fund the war</strong></p><p>The aggressive tax push is fallout from an economic war being waged as part of the five-year military campaign between the Houthis and the government</p><p>the Houthi rebels are rolling out aggressive taxes in their densely-populated areas of control. The tax push is part of an economic war being waged as part of the five-year military campaign between the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition backing the internationally recognized government of Yemen’s President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.</p><p>In response to tightening oil import restrictions which have eroded Houthi revenues, the rebels have looked elsewhere for income, including through more aggressive tax collection from the approximately 20 million people living in rebel-held areas.</p><p>By some estimates, the Houthis have increased revenue from tax collection by 500 percent, compared to pre-war tax revenues, according to Abdulghani Al-Iryani, senior researcher at the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies. And that fivefold increase is only about half of what the Houthi-run Ministry of Finance plans to collect, he said.</p><p>“The Houthis will continue to increase their pressure to pay the full tax,” Al-Iryani said. “In the meantime, the suffering of the people is increasing massively.”</p><p>In the early years of the war, one of the Houthis’ main sources of revenue came from the taxation and sale of imported petroleum products, some of which Iran donated to the rebels, as detailed by the UN panel of experts on Yemen. With the help of the <span><a href="https://www.vimye.org/opsnap">UN</a></span> and the Saudi-led coalition naval ships, the Hadi government has tried to cut off that revenue stream with two decrees. </p><p>Cabinet decree No. 75, signed in November 2018, restricts the Houthis’ ability to finance imports outside the formal banking system, and <span><a href="https://ecyemen.com/announcements/1468/">decree No. 49</a></span>, signed in July 2019, requires importers to pay customs taxes to the Hadi government before entering Hodeidah ports. </p><p>While the decrees appear to have slowed the flow of Iranian-procured oil reaching the Hodeidah ports and reduced Houthi tax revenues from other importers, they’ve also exacerbated fuel shortages in Houthi-controlled areas by blocking or delaying fuel tankers for weeks at a time. The Houthis have retaliated by turning away tankers that have complied with the government decrees. </p><p>Another front in the economic war involves the Central Bank of Yemen,</p><p>Ibb governorate, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Sana’a, has been one of the testing grounds for taxing the populace.</p><p>In the governorate’s capital, Ibb city, the Houthis recently introduced what they call “tax completion” for merchants, shopkeepers and real estate owners, according to residents, who describe it as a 50 percent tax added to their overall tax bill. </p><p>Mohammed Mansour, a spice shop owner in downtown Ibb, told Almasdar Online he was recently charged 225,000 Yemeni rials ($375*) in income tax, which included 150,000 rials ($250) in tax and 75,000 rials ($125) for tax completion.</p><p>Business taxes are often calculated during visits by the local tax official and a “supervisor,” a senior Houthi official assigned to oversee particular districts, neighborhoods or government departments. Based on an arbitrary assessment of what a particular business is worth, the authorities issue a tax bill, as in Mansour’s case. Business owners who refuse to pay are threatened with referral to another Houthi supervisor in the tax office, who charges twice the approved amount, he said.</p><p>"In the midst of the crisis, where some businesses have come to a halt, we can’t manage the expenses of our houses or pay the rent of our shops,” Mansour said. “They are taking our money in the name of taxes," he said.</p><p>Tax completion is one of many taxes imposed by Houthis since the group seized power in 2015. Some, like the taxes that fund public services including garbage removal and street cleaners, are legitimate. Others less so. Mansour has a collection of receipts documenting the payment of various Houthi-imposed taxes, such as the Prophet's Birth, Martyr's Day, Al-Ghadeer, Al-Welayah, Allegiance, and Sept. 21 (the anniversary of rebels’ coup d'état in Sana’a in 2014). </p><p>“What can we do?" he lamented. "The rule of the strong over the weak, stealing and plundering people's money,” he said. “Who can we complain to about this injustice?”</p><p>Property owners in Ibb city told Almasdar Online the Houthis charged 250,000 rials ($375) in real estate tax. One landlord, who asked to remain anonymous, said Houthi authorities extracted additional taxes and fines from him after paying the agreed upon bill.</p><p>The imposition of income taxes on traders and real estate by Houthi comes in the context of expanding their revenues, according to economist Abdul Wahid Al-Awbali.</p><p>"The Houthis’ income taxes are a series of organized and systematic looting of the money of merchants and property owners,” he said. “They impose income taxes as they wish, and they use only the name of law in the process," he said. </p><p>Al-Iryani sees the Houthi tax push as an effect of the broader economic war being waged between the Saudi-backed Hadi government and the Houthis. </p><p>This weaponization of the economy has led groups to seek new ways to generate revenue. </p><p>“They’ve been weaponizing the economy for a long time, but now it’s just more aggressive,” said. “What that results in is the Houthis turning to the general population and squeezing them for more fees and taxes – when the economy is weaponized, both sides increase pressure on the population.” </p><p><span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/393">https://al-masdaronline.net/national/393</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B T)</strong></p><p><strong>Whither al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula?</strong></p><p>What does the death of al-Raymi mean for AQAP’s future operations and long-term strategies? In short, very little. While al-Raymi was, by some accounts, a skilled tactician, his influence within the organization was never as pronounced as that of his predecessor, Nasir al-Wuhayshi. While this partly reflects the different styles and core competencies of the two leaders, more importantly, it reflects the fact that AQAP has moved away from relying on a hierarchical core for leadership. [1] Instead, it is implementing an atomized organizational structure that empowers local operatives. [2] AQAP has also reordered its priorities and objectives.</p><p>Such changes began as early as 2017. They were a response to the increased pressure from coalition-backed forces and the fluid socio-political environment that AQAP must navigate. [3] While AQAP maintains a veneer of ideology, it has long since deprioritized imposing strict interpretations of sharia, holding territory, and carrying out attacks on foreign targets. Instead, AQAP’s focus is parochial and pragmatic. [4]</p><p>One of AQAP’s core strategies is the seeding of its operatives and fighters throughout Yemen’s disparate collection of security forces and militias. AQAP fighters have been knowingly and unknowingly recruited into many of these forces which operate throughout south Yemen and in pockets of territory in northern Yemen. Various fighting forces—even those opposed to one another—value these operatives and fighters for their expertise, discipline, and, in some cases, for their ability to access dark networks (<span><a href="https://jamestown.org/program/guns-hire-al-qaeda-arabian-peninsula-securing-future-yemen/">Terrorism Monitor</a></span>, January 26, 2018). AQAP and the Islamic State in Yemen (ISY) have benefited directly and indirectly from the involvement of the UAE and Saudi Arabia in Yemen. Both countries have, at times, de-prioritized battling AQAP in favor of fighting the Houthis and pursuing their own objectives in Yemen (<span><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2018/6/13/saudi-arabias-non-aggression-pact-with-al-qaeda-in-yemen">The New Arab</a></span>, June 12, 2018; <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/08/report-saudi-uae-coalition-cut-deals-al-qaeda-yemen-180806074659521.html">al-Jazeera</a></span>, August 6, 2018). AQAP-linked fighters fight alongside many of Yemen’s militias and security forces, most notably in the still-contested city of Taiz and in the governorates of Marib and al-Jawf. [5]</p><p>The seeding and even the hiring out of its fighters to various militias is a way of securing influence, funds, and access to illicit trade networks. All of these are fundamental to AQAP’s long-term survival and to the survival of its operatives. AQAP has followed the tactical and strategic moves that have been made by many terrorist and insurgent groups.</p><p><span>Just as war drives innovation and change in war-fighting technologies, it also supercharges the evolution of insurgent and terrorist groups. An organization’s failure to change in response to the dynamic environment in which it operates likely portends its end. AQAP’s resilience is a testament to the group’s ability to remake itself. The complexity of Yemen’s interlocking wars and the prolonged involvement of outside powers mean that AQAP has been forced to evolve into a more diffuse organization. This will impact the “AQAP” brand and may mean that AQAP becomes something of a constellation of loosely allied groups in Yemen. At the same time, AQAP will be less legible than it has been in the past. This lack of legibility is very much in its interest as it attempts to evade counter-terrorism efforts, access illicit networks, and profit from Yemen’s wars. AQAP’s evolution may point toward how the next wave of insurgent and terrorist groups will operate. These groups will be more amorphous, increasingly local, and more purposefully illegible – by Michael Horton</span></p><p><span><a href="https://jamestown.org/program/whither-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula/">https://jamestown.org/program/whither-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula/</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics</span></h2><p>(A H)</p><p>Film (in Arabic): Fears of coronavirus in Yemen</p><p>Yemeni citizens expressed their fear of the proliferating of the coronavirus in Yemen because of the serious risk it carries that may lead to further suffering and pain, especially as it has invaded many developing and developed countries</p><p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GL4xEiC-TM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GL4xEiC-TM</a></span></p><p>(A H P)</p><p>Yemen is Coronavirus-free to now, says [Hadi gov.] Health Ministry</p><p>Deputy Health Minister for Primary Healthcare said Yemen "is free from Coronavirus up till now.<br /> In a statement to Saba News Agency, Ali al-Waleedi on Tuesday said a range of measures have been taken by the ministry "in preparation for any emergencies."<br /> He dismissed the claims that Yemen is going to receive foreigners infected with the virus are "just rumors."</p><p><span><a href="http://en.adenpress.news/news/18502">http://en.adenpress.news/news/18502</a></span></p><p>and also <span><a href="https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-38065">https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-38065</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://al-masdaronline.net/national/395">https://al-masdaronline.net/national/395</a></span></p><p>My comment: How do they know this?

Fighting <span><a href="https://apnews.com/2ead3437db66e3d539d421561a85f7ee">is escalating</a></span> on the ground. The Houthi rebels have resumed missile attacks on Saudi Arabia and the Saudis have resumed air strikes on Sana’a. If the war escalates further, there is a danger it will expand and draw in Iran and America more than previously.</p><p>The Saudis were very alarmed that President Trump said the September attacks were against Saudi Arabia and not the United States. The differentiation made the Saudis lose faith.</p><p>But the talks failed to develop a political framework for a firm ceasefire and a resolution of the civil war, which is at the core of the struggle. Riyadh was unwilling to give up the discredited government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who is in exile in the Saudi capital. Without a political process, the reduction in violence is at risk.</p><p>Iran’s influence with the Houthis is growing. The assistance Tehran provides to the Houthis missile program is crucial to its growing capabilities.</p><p>The pace of operations is still less than it was six months ago, but the trend is worrisome. The Houthis are not controlled by Iran, but the war is pushing them deeper into the Iranian orbit — precisely the nightmare the Saudis said the war was intended to prevent.</p><p>The Trump administration is not going to press Saudi Arabia to end the war: For instance, the secretary of state made no effort to end the war in his visit to the kingdom last week. The administration believes the war is part of the maximum pressure campaign against Iran, and it has vetoed Congress’ efforts to end U.S. involvement in the war. Congress is going to need to redouble its efforts to shut down the American support for the war.

Conflict Zone meets the country’s foreign minister.</p><p>At the Munich Security Conference in February, Yemeni Foreign Minister Mohammed Al-Hadrami told DW's Conflict Zone that peace would come and power could be shared with the Houthis, but not with guns "pointing in our face."</p><p>"We're not just going to have any peace with the Houthis," Al-Hadrami said.</p><p>"I'm not going to give the future of Yemen to those who believe that they could just, you know, take Yemen and have this divine right to rule us like what they do in Iran. We're not going to accept that."</p><p>Conflict Zone host Tim Sebastian confronted the foreign minister over whether he had had little to say about the thousands of civilian casualties and deaths from bombings by the Saudi-led coalition.</p><p>"Well that’s not accurate, actually. The war is ugly. I'm not even going to sugarcoat that for you or for anyone. A lot of civilians are dead, yes. This is shocking," Al-Hadrami told Sebastian, but the minister disputed that his government had looked the other way.</p><p>Had they been complicit in human rights violations by the coalition?</p><p>"We have this giant which is an investigation body that has investigated over 170 claims. We know there's some mistakes. We proved that there's some mistakes."</p><p>With the two sides now at a stalemate, Sebastian suggested that the bombings and the resulting death and injury had all been for nothing.</p><p>"It's been a change in the way the coalition has been conducting this war. There's no more campaign to actually target Sanaa and other cities," the foreign minister said. He repeated that the war needed to end but blamed the rebels for the delay.</p><p>"Everything that happens in Yemen is a reaction to the Houthis' actions.

Talking from his new hometown of Marib, he was filled with fond memories of training alongside his comrades-in-arms and the war songs they sang together: “Our morale is high, and our enemy is dead on his stomach.” The Houthi militia had sent him to the frontlines to “fight the Zionists and Americans’ brute force in Yemen.” Before enlisting with the militia, Mohammed had never carried a weapon in his life.</p><p>72 percent of the 762 cases of child soldier recruitment they examined were attributed to the Houthis, followed by pro-government popular committees, which accounted for 15 percent of all recruitments, and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) with 9 percent.</p><p>Local reports by a Yemeni non-government organization, al-Wethaq Foundation for Civic Orientation, specializing in rehabilitating child soldiers in Yemen, cited 2561 cases of recruitment, and 625 deaths of child soldiers, 50% of the cases they studied were below the age of 15.</p><p>The Iranian-backed Houthi militia has been much like the pied piper, leading children into conflict under the false pretense of protecting them from greater threats. Since the Houthis marched to Sana’a in late 2014 – overthrowing the government of President Abed Rabbu Mansour Hadi, an increasing numbers of child soldiers between the ages of 8 and 17 have been recorded all over Yemen.</p><p>Indeed, children form an indispensable part of the Houthi militia. They are enthusiastic, quick, agile, and easier to equip with food and resources, which make them desirable recruits. The militia utilized them during all six wars against the government of Yemen between 2004 and 2010.

He befriended the appointed Houthi <em>mushref </em>(supervisor) in his neighborhood, a local broker for the militias who eventually convinced Mohammed to join the Houthis: “They were friendly, really friendly at first,” he recalled.</p><p>“Unfortunately, there is no real interest in the phenomenon of child recruitment and the adoption of programs to rehabilitate children,” said Najeeb al-Saidi, head of Wethaq. He also emphasized building awareness on the need for trauma healing, as Yemeni society still ostracizes rehabilitation and mental illness.</p><p>Moreover, despite rhetoric to combat the phenomenon, child soldiers were reported to be part of Yemen’s government army, with recruits as young as 15. According to interviews with an official who wishes to remain anonymous: “some of the children would enlist in the army because they see it as a source of income, and not many officers would turn them away.”</p><p>The Yemeni government, which frequently criticizes the Houthis for their practice, haven’t exactly articulated any measures to remove underage soldiers. “We do not actively seek children like the Houthis, we just do not have the ability to enforce regulations when many of the recruits do not know their age,” the official said – by Fatima Abo Alasrar</p><p><span><a href="https://insidearabia.com/yemens-pied-piper-a-child-soldier-tragedy/">https://insidearabia.com/yemens-pied-piper-a-child-soldier-tragedy/</a></span></p><p>(A P)</p><p>Rasd Coalition and the European Organizations Union for Peace in Yemen Organize a Seminar at University of Geneva, on Houthis Violations in the Education and Development Sector in Yemen</p><p>The Yemeni Coalition for Monitoring Human Rights Violations "Rasd Coalition " organized today a seminar on "Houthis Violations; Ongoing Reality - Education as an Example" at the University of Geneva in cooperation with the European Organizations Union for Peace in Yemen, on the sidelines of the 43rd session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland.<br /> The seminar, chaired by Professor Alexander Lambert, Director of the International Health and Development Program at the University of Geneva, addressed major violations affecting the education and children in Yemen.<br /> Dr. Khaled Abdekarem, member of Allied European Organizations for Peace in Yemen, head of the International Center for Media and Development, reviewed children violations (Child Recruitment as an Example).<br /> Dr. Khaled pointed to Houthis targeting of educational process</p><p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/415969811946619/posts/1322044844672440/">https://www.facebook.com/415969811946619/posts/1322044844672440/</a></span></p><p>My comment: RASD is mostly anti-Houthi, this “European Organizations Union for Peace in Yemen” is completely unknown (I also googled just “Union for Peace in Yemen”).

Seventy-six percent of internally displaced persons in Yemen are <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2018/9/take-five-areej-jamal-al--khawlani">women and children</a>, many of whom lack basic medical care, economic opportunity and access to education. Yemen’s ongoing civil war has worsened pre-existing living conditions for girls and women in the country. Educational opportunities for girls are also at risk of disappearing from the continued conflict in the region.</p><p>Conditional cash transfer programs have enabled poorer families to send their daughters to school. From 2004 to 2012, the Yemeni government collaborated with other organizations to give stipends to girl students in grades four to nine, under the conditions that they maintain a school attendance of 80 percent and receive passing grades. The result of the monetary aid showed a shift in the cultural norms of the recipient communities. Adults began to change their perspectives on girls’ education and allowed more girls and women to attend school. The program has helped <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/04/11/yemen-breaking-barriers-to-girls-education">enroll over 39,000 girl</a> students into primary education.</p><p>More than <a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/after-years-civil-war-child-marriage-rise-yemen/33762">two-thirds of girls</a> marry before they turn 18. Families cope with economic hardships by selling their daughters into marriage. Early marriage has crippled girls’ education in Yemen. Instead of pursuing studies, girls take on household roles and often become victims of abuse by their husbands.</p><p><span>In 2019, UNICEF started to pay more than 136,000 teachers who had not received salaries in over two years. The program offered the equivalent payment of $50 a month to school teachers and staff to help address the low attendance rates of students in the country.</span></p><p><span>The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund has set target goals to improve conditions for girls’ education in Yemen in 2020. UNICEF plans to provide individual learning materials to one million children, create education access to 820,000 students and ensure 134,000 teachers receive incentives to continue to teach.</span></p><p>Yemeni girls have many obstacles to attaining quality education. However, the ending of a drawn-out war and continued aid and support from organizations across the world is bettering the situation. These are small and steady steps, helping to ensure that the nation’s girls will lead lives full of learning and progression. These 10 facts about girls’ education in Yemen shed light on the issue of Yemen’s education system.</p><p><span><a href="https://borgenproject.org/10-facts-about-girls-education-in-yemen/">https://borgenproject.org/10-facts-about-girls-education-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p>Rapid Response Mechanism-First Line Response: UNFPA Flash Update (Sana’a And Sa’ada Hubs) from 19 Jan to 22 February 2020</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/rapid-response-mechanism-first-line-response-unfpa-flash-update-sana-and-sa-ada-hubs-0">https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/rapid-response-mechanism-first-line-response-unfpa-flash-update-sana-and-sa-ada-hubs-0</a></span></p><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p><span>Landsaid hilft Jemen</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.pressreader.com/germany/landsberger-tagblatt/20200224/282699049155783">https://www.pressreader.com/germany/landsberger-tagblatt/20200224/282699049155783</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>Maternal emergency center in Sarar district, Abian.
