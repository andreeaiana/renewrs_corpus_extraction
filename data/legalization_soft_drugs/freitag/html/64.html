The STC, the southern separatist group that has to date been funded and supported by the UAE, is to be absorbed into the Yemeni government, which itself will become answerable to a Saudi committee overseeing the implementation of the agreement. </p><p>Political Aspects of the Agreement</p><p>On the political front, the most important aspect of the Riyadh Agreement is the plan to form a new government including representatives from the STC, which from its inception in May 2017 until now had refused to recognize the Yemeni government’s sovereignty and regularly challenged it for control of southern governorates. </p><p>The agreement seems aimed to improve government decision-making and make it more inclusive. It attempts this by mandating that posts at the cabinet table be filled by properly qualified technocrats well known for their integrity. While these ministers will be politically affiliated – with cabinet seats also evenly split between northerners and southerners – the candidates must have previously refrained from engaging in “inflammatory propaganda”. Importantly, these ministers must be agreed to by consultations among the various anti-Houthi political forces</p><p>At the governorate level, as well as calling for a new governor of Aden, the agreement also specifies that new governors will be named for Al-Dhalea and Abyan governorates within 30 days of the agreement being signed. The singling out of these two southern governorates is notable; as historic rivals, they are also currently bastions of support for the main parties to the agreement, Al-Dhalea for the STC and, to a lesser extent, Abyan for the Hadi government</p><p>In regard to public finances, the agreement stipulates that all state revenues (including oil exports, customs, etc.) shall be deposited in the central bank in Aden – an attempt to end the recent practice of several governorates collecting and keeping these revenues for local spending purposes. The Riyadh Agreement states that transparency will be ensured through having all public spending subject to parliamentary oversight</p><p>The Riyadh Agreement’s mandates for government reforms, reasserting government control over revenues and resources, and the activation of supervisory agencies, would portend a house-cleaning of corruption and ineptitude that have stifled the government. However, the agreement does not include any clauses related to the high-level bureaucracy</p><p>In specific regard to the STC, the Riyadh Agreement represents the first official recognition of the group as a political entity by Saudi Arabia. </p><p>Military and Security Aspects of the Agreement</p><p>The Riyadh Agreement calls for a widespread overhaul of the structure and composition of military and security forces across southern Yemen, with the apparent aim to unify command and control. Officially, most of the recomposed units will be under the Yemeni government ministries of defense and interior, but ultimately all units – save a presidential guard unit tasked with protecting both the president and STC leaders – will take directions from Riyadh. This reconfiguration is, according to the agreement, slated to be staggered over a 90-day period – an extremely ambitious timeline in an environment as fragmented as southern Yemen. </p><p>The immediate focus of the agreement is to reset the clock on territorial advances made during clashes between STC- and Yemeni government-affiliated forces that began in August this year.</p><p>The Riyadh agreement then focuses on securing Aden. All heavy weapons in the city held by any party – including tanks, armored vehicles, missile launchers and the like – are to be moved to bases under Saudi control within 15 days and cannot be redeployed except under Saudi approval and guidance.</p><p>The military and security component of the Riyadh Agreement seems clearly intended to project a new reality of Saudi security control in southern Yemen. While the text of the agreement repeatedly makes reference to the “coalition” which began the regional military intervention in Yemen, given the UAE’s continuing withdrawal of forces the only significant power left in the consortium is Saudi Arabia. The Riyadh Agreement thus enshrines a new military dynamic; one where Riyadh assumes full oversight of all anti-Houthi forces in southern Yemen, most importantly supervising the movement of, and weapons supplied to, STC-aligned forces that had previously been beholden to Abu Dhabi. </p><p>Looking Ahead</p><p>While the Riyadh Agreement should position Saudi Arabia as the uncontested authority in southern Yemen, many factors still stand against the agreement’s success. </p><p>The agreement must also deal with the unwritten technicalities of how it should be implemented – By Maged al-Madhaji</p><p><a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/8324">https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/8324</a></p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Preparing for a Failed War</strong></p><p>The recent Riyadh agreement was an effort by the Saudis and Emiratis to define future zones of influence in Yemen.</p><p><span>However, the accord is really little more than a power-sharing agreement between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, through their respective proxies. At the same time, its vagueness means it carries the seeds of more divisions among Yemeni parties and could be a prelude to new conflicts.</span></p><p><span>The deal is not only the outcome of a month-long negotiation process between Yemeni parties, but also part of broader understanding between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. It is a result of efforts led by Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, who since last March became the Saudi official in charge of the Yemeni file.</span></p><p>After more than four years of conflict, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are more than ever convinced that the costly Yemen war should end. This is especially true after increasing international criticism that the Arab coalition has caused major civilian casualties and following attacks by Ansar Allah, better known as the Houthis, against Saudi targets. This pushed the Arab coalition partners to search for a new approach to organize matters among the factions aligned with them, and in that way create separate zones of influence for both countries.</p><p>According to the Riyadh agreement, the UAE-backed STC is to be a part of the legitimate government, while its armed forces will be integrated into the forces of Yemen’s Ministries of Defense and Interior. Through the STC’s participation, the agreement will give the UAE a say in the new government in Aden. On the other side, the Saudis will oversee implementation of the agreement, both politically and on the ground. In this context, the UAE will withdraw its troops from Aden and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emirates-military-yemen/uae-withdraws-its-troops-from-aden-hands-control-to-saudi-arabia-idUSKBN1X923A">hand over control to Saudi Arabia</a>. Moreover, the Saudis will be responsible for interpreting the agreement’s articles in case of a misunderstanding.</p><p>The agreement contains annexes covering political, economic, military, and security arrangements. Accordingly, all steps in the deal center on dividing authority between the two parties. However, the representation of south and north Yemen used in the agreement is one of its problematic points. That is because most of the political forces in Yemen that claim to represent large geographical areas in fact only do so because they have the means to mobilize and enjoy support from regional powers. None were democratically elected to represent the people or areas that they claim to represent. This applies to the Houthis, the STC, and factions in Hadi’s government, including the Islah Party. In effect, the agreement reduces the aspirations of Yemenis to parties that do not necessarily enjoy significant popular backing in their areas of control.</p><p><span>Another mistake made in the agreement, one that is similar to all the agreements signed following the uprising against the late president ‘Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011, is that it fails to adopt an inclusive approach. The Riyadh agreement ignores several factions, including southern factions that are not aligned with the STC.</span></p><p><span>On the political front, the agreement deals with the current political elites, who are authorized to run affairs for unknown period of time. Yet these elites have lost legitimacy because many have extended their time in office beyond their prescribed mandates.</span></p><p><span>The agreement also suffers from keeping Yemen under the trusteeship of regional powers, as it deprives the state of any sovereignty. Several articles emphasize Saudi supervision of the new government that will be formed as a consequence of the Riyadh agreement. In addition, it legitimizes the Saudi-UAE military presence in areas of Yemen, including the easternmost governorate of Mahra that is under Saudi control. This means that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will continue to have the latitude to intervene in internal Yemeni affairs.</span></p><p><span>After five years of war in Yemen, the situation in the country is no longer a matter for Yemenis. Instead, it has turned into a proxy conflict for regional powers – by Ahmed Nagi</span></p><p><a href="https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/80282">https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/80282</a></p><p>My remark: More in cp6.</p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1b Am wichtigsten: Kampf um Hodeidah / Most important: Hodeidah battle</span></h2><p><span>(A K pH)</span></p><p>US-Saudi Mercenaries Intensify Targeting of Ad-durayhimi, Hodeidah</p><p>The homes of citizens of the besieged city of Ad-durayhimi in Hodeidah governorate were heavily bombarded by US-Saudi paid fighters.</p><p>According to a local source in the city, the Saudi-mercenaries targeted the city with more than 80 artillery shells in the continuous and intense shelling, which destroyed houses.

Following is an edited version of their conversation.</p><p>Was there any particular methodology you followed that helped you get so close to these stories?</p><p>It started with extensive research, as we needed to build on what was already reported — not just start from scratch. Then we dug for sources and began to move out into those corresponding circles, including researchers, think tanks, activists, and local reporters. The second circle was shaped by former officials, friends, relatives, family members. The third circle was people who were directly involved in the story, so those who had first-hand accounts of what we were looking for — a victim or someone directly involved in abuses, a witness, or an official in charge.</p><p>Then we heavily relied on Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram in reaching out to people because we knew people are always worried about speaking on the phone. When we had a shortlist of sources, we started planning a visit. When our team was done with drawing the circles and maps, we did a series of interviews that sometimes took hours with a single person, recording, taking notes, then transcribing, and keeping all notes in one folder.</p><p>How did you prove the story of torture against former and current detainees in the UAE prisons in Yemen?</p><p>We used testimonies from former detainees, those who were tortured and those who witnessed the torture of others. We were able to document the torture through officials who worked in the prisons; I met with them (detainees and officials) and took down first-hand accounts of what was happening.</p><p>You covered torture in Houthi prisons as well. Did you approach this story differently?</p><p>The Houthi prisons’ story was easier to dig into than the Emiratis because it was widely acknowledged locally, even if it was largely ignored by international media. Also, the detainees we met were in safer areas and were able to speak freely, while those held by the Emiratis were still living in areas under UAE control in southern Yemen. For the Houthi prisons, we managed to obtain a rare video showing one of the leaders confessing the torture.</p><p><span>Give us your tips on dealing with sources, how you convinced them to talk, and how you protected them.</span></p><p><span>As a rule, if we quoted sources speaking on the condition of anonymity then each piece of information needed at least two to three sources to be able to use the information in the story. Often I used Maad’s help to confirm and other times I was assisted by other sources. I always give them assurance that their names, titles, and jobs will remain secret. I show them my previous work, and I also show them that I am interested in confirming what I already know.</span></p><p><a href="https://gijn.org/2019/11/06/yemens-dirty-war-a-qa-with-pulitzer-winner-maggie-micheal/">https://gijn.org/2019/11/06/yemens-dirty-war-a-qa-with-pulitzer-winner-maggie-micheal/</a></p><p><span>(* B H K)</span></p><p>JEMEN: IHRE GESCHICHTE, UNSERE VERANTWORTUNG</p><p>Rund 12.000 Zivilisten sind in den vergangenen vier Jahren bei Luftangriffen im Jemen getötet worden.

So you have to prove over time that you are neutral, that you're impartial and that you apply those principles from the beginning, and don't change them – to demonstrate integrity from the start. But at the same time, respecting cultural factors and values to somehow create that acceptance by the communities where you work. But it can be quite a rollercoaster: some days you’re accepted, the next you’re viewed badly. <br /> I think the advantage in us working with Tearfund is that we are able to engage in areas where maybe other humanitarian groups won’t go because they are considered to be insignificant or not known. And I think this is the advantage. Tearfund is known.<br /> Andrew: How are the Yemeni people coping with this crisis?<br /> Partner: There is a huge sense of fatigue. The biggest challenge is anything from depression to burn out. I think in the beginning of the crisis people were looking for hope in their family and their social groups, which is very important in Yemen. But now families are breaking up and so social and family support is being destroyed. That is unusual for this society as community accountability and social support is typical for Yemenis.</p><p>Andrew: How are the younger generations coping with the crisis in Yemen?<br /> Partner: For many young people in Yemen they have always known war and conflict. What they are not familiar with is that this crisis is taking everything away that they could dream of. <br /> They feel robbed of purpose and identity, and that is the biggest crisis. The war is also making them vulnerable and exposed to people who come with harmful ideologies and radicalism. So even though young people are open-minded and questioning, we're also seeing some of them being radicalised and recruited into armed groups.</p><p><a href="https://www.tearfund.org/en/2019/11/finding_courage_in_the_midst_of_the_yemen_crisis/">https://www.tearfund.org/en/2019/11/finding_courage_in_the_midst_of_the_yemen_crisis/</a></p><p>(B H)</p><p>Thalassaemia patients have renewed hope through support provided by the Emergency Health and Nutrition Project</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, through the Emergency Health and Nutrition Project (EHNP), are providing life-saving support to thalassemia patients in Yemen.<br /> In 2019, blood bags provided reached almost 45 000 bag, along with laboratory reagents critical to ensuring safe blood transfusions further strengthening the capacity at the blood transfusion centres across the country.</p><p>In Yemen, a country ravaged by war, the treatment of thalassemia is a rare but much needed miracle.

With the support of the Milan-based nongovernmental organization EMERGENCY — WHO and ECHO are working to provide effective and timely trauma support in Yemen.</p><p>“The conflict in Yemen is a harsh reality that continues to evolve and escalate and EMERGENCY, and WHO, with the support of its partner ECHO, are working to strengthen access to life-saving specialized surgical care for the conflict-affected population. The opening of a surgical centre for war victims in Hajjah will allow reaching out to a large population in need of war surgery,” said Emanuele Nannini, EMERGENCY's Deputy Director of Operations in Milan.</p><p>This lifeline of funding aims to target over 30 000 beneficiaries, support over 40 surgical team specialists and provide incentives to almost 300 health workers.</p><p>Though many deaths have occurred due to noncommunicable and communicable diseases, a large number of deaths also happen outside of the health system, like conflict-related trauma. Trauma patients are part of the reason why hospital resources are so overstretched.</p><p>Bed occupancy, prescription of medicines and other health needs of trauma patients add an additional burden on facilities that are also overwhelmed with patients suffering from non-war injuries or diseases. Conflict-related injuries have consequences that reverberate even after the patient is discharged. Trauma patients with serious injuries who are not treated immediately risk living with life-long disabilities that threaten their health and livelihoods, affecting their capacity to earn a living, lead a normal life and contribute wholly to society.</p><p><a href="http://www.emro.who.int/yem/yemen-news/with-up-to-70-000-casualties-echo-and-who-partnership-meet-critical-trauma-needs-in-yemen.html">http://www.emro.who.int/yem/yemen-news/with-up-to-70-000-casualties-echo-and-who-partnership-meet-critical-trauma-needs-in-yemen.html</a></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p>UNO: Alle 11 Minuten stirbt ein Kind im Jemen</p><p>Das UNHCR teilte am Dienstagabend dazu mit, in dem Krisenland sterbe alle zehn Minuten ein Kind.

The Houthi satellite channel, al-Masirah, is headquartered in Beirut; Houthi leaders increasingly travel to Lebanon, where reports suggest they have been gifted a number of residences; and there have been, and likely continue to be, Hizbullah trainers on the ground in Yemen. Hizbullah does not manage the relationship between Iran and the Houthis.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/iran-dossier/iran-19-07-ch-5-yemen">https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/iran-dossier/iran-19-07-ch-5-yemen</a></p><p>My comment: The whole study, in cp9a.

Das viel größere Problem mit den Houthis bleibt ungelöst. Doch vielleicht kommt auch in diesen Konflikt Bewegung.</p><p>Allerdings eröffnet die Übereinkunft nur den Ausweg aus einem der Konflikte, die den Jemen verheeren. Der schwerwiegendste, der Houthi-Konflikt, ist von der Übereinkunft nur indirekt betroffen.</p><p>Dass die Übereinkunft selbst am Ende ein Erfolg wird, ist allerdings nicht ausgemacht. Wie schon bei vorigen Abkommen im Jemen werden Probleme erwartet, wenn es darum geht, die Vorgaben in die Tat umzusetzen. Und es gibt genug Schlupflöcher für Sabotage, Verzögerung oder Finten.</p><p>So schwingt bei westlichen Diplomaten noch deutliche Skepsis mit, wenn sie erklären, die Einigung könne „als Formelkompromiss“ funktionieren und positive Wirkung entfalten. „Das Gute ist, dass beide Seiten es als Erfolg ansehen und verkaufen können“, sagt ein jemenitischer Beobachter, der den Separatisten nahe steht. Damit ist gemeint, dass die Eingliederung der Separatisten-Milizen möglicherweise nicht über den Grad hinausgehen wird, der für beide Seiten zur Gesichtswahrung gerade so nötig ist.</p><p>Sollte ein solches Arrangement halten, wäre das ein Erfolg für Muhammad bin Salman, der im Jemen auf eine Zeit zum Teil schwerer Rückschläge zurückblickt. Denn Saudi-Arabien soll über die Verwirklichung des Abkommens wachen – und würde zur dominierenden Macht im Südjemen, der zuvor fest in der Hand der Emirate war. Das saudische Militär des Königreichs hat seine Präsenz in Aden schon vor einiger Zeit verstärkt. Doch auch in dieser Hinsicht gibt es offen Fragen. Zum Beispiel, ob die Emirate tatsächlich alle ihre Hebel im Südjemen bereitwillig aus der Hand geben? </p><p>Auch sind die grundsätzlichen Probleme nicht gelöst. Hadi ist weiter verhasst, korrupt und schwach. Vertreter der Separatisten machen schon jetzt deutlich, dass das Abkommen von Riad vor allem den aktuellen Konflikt um Aden beilegen soll. Noch ist lange nicht besiegelt, dass diese Sache aufgehen wird. „Wir sind jetzt in einer besseren Ausgangsposition“, sagt einer von ihnen – von Christoph Ehrhardt</p><p><a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/krieg-im-jemen-was-ist-das-friedensabkommen-von-riad-wert-16471527.html">https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/krieg-im-jemen-was-ist-das-friedensabkommen-von-riad-wert-16471527.html</a></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>Kleiner Schritt Richtung Frieden</p><p>Regierung und Separatisten wollen sich die Macht teilen.

Der ehemalige saudische Botschafter in Washington, Turki bin Faisal, hatte Anfang November in einem Interview mit der Website Al-Monitor offen den schlechten Ruf des Landes eingeräumt. "Es ist offensichtlich, dass Ereignisse wie der 11. September (2001) und der Mord an Jamal Khashoggi einen stigmatisierenden Effekt auf das Königreich haben und wir die ersten sind, die darunter leiden", so der ehemalige Diplomat.</p><p>So könnte die Vermittlung im Jemen ein Schritt sein, den ramponierten Ruf des Landes wiederherzustellen. Allerdings ist Saudi-Arabien nicht nur Moderator, sondern auch Partei. Die nun wieder hergestellte Einheit im Süden könnte auch dazu dienen, die gemeinsame Front gegen die Huthis zu stärken, heißt es in einer Analyse des katarischen Nachrichtensenders Al-Jazeera.</p><p>Ebenso könnte sie aber auch dazu dienen, die in Verhandlungsposition der Regierung, des STC und internationalen Militärkoalition unter saudischer Führung gegenüber den <a href="https://www.dw.com/de/jemenitische-miliz-wer-sind-die-huthis/a-50677090">Huthis</a> und dem sie unterstützenden <a href="https://www.dw.com/de/iran-gewinner-im-machtpoker-in-nahost/a-50891219">Iran</a> zu stärken</p><p>Mögliche Auswirkungen im Südjemen</p><p>Offen ist, was die nun geschlossene Vereinbarung zwischen Regierung und dem südlichen Übergangsrat für den Jemen bedeutet. Die Vereinbarung berge Risiken, so der katarische Politanalyst Said Thabet im Interview mit Al-Jazeera. Durch die Vereinbarung verleihe die Regierung den Aufständischen des STC, der für die Abspaltung des südlichen vom nördlichen Landesteil eintritt, Legitimität.</p><p>So hat die nun getroffene Vereinbarung zwischen Regierung und dem Südlichen Übergangsrat günstige Voraussetzungen für die Befriedung des Jemen geschaffen. Dass sie aber hält und sich dann auch auf die Gespräche mit den Huthis auswirkt, ist nicht ausgemacht.

Vor allem aber soll die neue Einigkeit zwischen Regierung und Separatisten genutzt werden, um geschlossen gegenüber den Huthi-Rebellen aufzutreten - und das nicht nur auf dem Schlachtfeld: "Diese Vereinbarung wird, so Gott will, zu umfassenderen Gesprächen zwischen den Konfliktparteien in Jemen führen, um eine politische Lösung zu finden und den Krieg zu beenden", sagte der saudische Kronprinz Mohammed bin Salman nach der Unterzeichnung des Abkommens.</p><p><a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/jemen-eine-front-weniger-1.4670710">https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/jemen-eine-front-weniger-1.4670710</a></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>The Beginning of the End of Yemen’s Civil War?</p><p>For the first time in years, a viable pathway to peace in Yemen is in view. But obstacles remain, chiefly the gaps between the conflict parties’ positions. </p><p>The Riyadh Agreement places Saudi Arabia at the epicentre of Yemeni deal making. Khaled bin Salman will oversee its implementation and thus help shape the new government and security structures. The Saudis have also assumed coalition command in the south from the Emiratis</p><p>Meanwhile, in the north, discussions between the Huthis and Saudis over a de-escalation of cross-border attacks and front-line fighting have been inching along since September. If these talks succeed, a reduction in the conflict’s intensity could be a starting point for a nationwide ceasefire and facilitate the opening of political talks between the rebels and a more broadly representative government delegation. The Saudis thus have a chance to bring the various channels of negotiation together into a national political process under UN auspices.</p><p>The Riyadh Agreement, however, bears hallmarks of past intra-Yemeni deals that have failed. It is loosely worded, likely because vagueness was required to induce the rivals to sign it, and it leaves a number of questions around implementation unanswered. For example, the deal calls for both formation of a new government and a series of security sector reforms in Aden within 30 days of signing. The reforms include the formation of new mixed security forces, the removal of military units from the city and the transfer of heavy weapons to sites that the Saudis will oversee. But the deal does not specify in which order the parties are to take these steps. </p><p>Most importantly, neither side seems to have fully bought into the compromise to which they agreed on paper. </p><p>In common with past deals, delays and mutual recriminations can be expected once implementation begins. A return to fighting in the south is certainly in the realm of the possible. </p><p>A pivot to national political talks is by no means guaranteed, either. The Huthis say that talks with Riyadh are going well but that the Saudis are moving too slowly doing their part in de-escalation. They also report Saudi troop buildups along key front lines and worry that the Riyadh Agreement may presage a concerted military push against them. </p><p>In any case, lasting peace will not come easily to Yemen – by Peter Salisbury</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/beginning-end-yemens-civil-war">https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/beginning-end-yemens-civil-war</a> = <a href="https://lobelog.com/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-yemens-civil-war/">https://lobelog.com/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-yemens-civil-war/</a></p><p>and also, thread. <a href="https://twitter.com/peterjsalisbury/status/1191805781445926912">https://twitter.com/peterjsalisbury/status/1191805781445926912</a></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>Is the Riyadh deal dividing Yemen?</p><p>As a matter of fact, even though this deal was made to cover up the rifts and cracks that have formed between the UAE and Saudi Arabia with respect to Yemen and Iran in the last few months, if the parties are reasonable, it can also be the start to ending the Yemen war. In other words, it can be described as the lesser evil.</p><p>This attempt may allow life in Yemen to normalize, even if for a certain period of time, however, it will also pave the way to Yemen’s division as north and south, as was the case in 1967. There is no doubt that the UAE has been striving to realize this plan from the very beginning. However, the opposition of the coalition-backed Yemeni legitimate government and Saudi Arabia to this plan has triggered quests for a new formula. Because, in addition to the many reasons for the Yemen war, one of the most important realities was Saudi Arabia’s threats from Yemen to the southern borders. As a matter of fact, these threats had gone as far as capital Riyadh. Thus, Saudi Arabia long resisted the UAE’s intentions.</p><p>According to the alliance in Riyadh, the UAE will withdraw for now and, under the guarantee of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the new administration – that is claimed to represent all of Yemen – will take over in the south.</p><p>Yet, it is also clear that Saudi Arabia will not accept this all the way. Because for the time being, they have no plan on how to end the Iranian-backed Houthis’ domination in the north.

Instead, Saudi negotiators have been going back and forth between them since August 20, and the signing ceremony may be the first time the parties have been in the same room since violence erupted this summer. This level of distrust may limit their ability to meet the document’s call for organizing under a single political and military chain of command, even with Saudi mediation.</p><p>POLITICAL WINS</p><p>The four-page agreement cites the common objective of defeating the Houthi rebels, then lays out a series of general mandates that grants each party the legitimacy it seeks.</p><p>Moreover, the document indicates that individuals involved in the fighting in Aden since August are not eligible for ministerial appointments.

In their attempts to stifle these relationships, the Trump administration's maximum pressure campaign has severely damaged Iran’s economy, leading to a reduction in Iran’s defense budget, skyrocketing inflation, and an increase in healthcare costs.</p><p>These realities, however, have not affected the Iran-Houthi relationship in ways the administration has intended. The Houthi movement, unlike other groups in the region, was an anti-colonialist group at its inception and did not initially have strong ties with Iran; but as the administration continues to strangle Iran’s economy and add to the country’s already heightened sense of besiegement, the Iran-Houthi bond has grown.</p><p>Labeling the conflict in Yemen as a “proxy war” belies the origins of the Houthis, which unlike Hezbollah, did not rely on Iran’s support from the outset. The Houthi phenomenon was born out of growing encroachment from foreign forces into a traditionally isolated society. Saudi benefactors financed countless Wahhabi madrassas in northern Yemen in an attempt to undermine the Shia-affiliated Zaydi’s, whose strongholds are tucked under the Kingdom’s southern border. </p><p>The relationship in the late 2000s and early 2010s was minimal, and at times, contentious.</p><p>From Associate to Accomplice</p><p>Several Trump officials have stated that their main priority concerning Iran is to moderate its regional behavior. From the Iranian perspective, such objectives harken back to the 1979 revolution, which was partially a response to the Shah’s cozy relationship with the United States. Since then, Iranian officials have operated under the notion that the United States and its allies are dedicated to undermining the Islamic Republic. Trump’s maximum pressure campaign has only exacerbated these sentiments and has pushed Iran to double down on its regional policies.</p><p>In the wake of the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trumps-close-call-diplomacy-with-irans-president-hassan-rouhani">breakdown</a> of negotiations at the UN General Assembly, the administration has imposed a new set of sanctions on Iran’s Central Bank in attempts to stem the flow of funds to Iran’s allies in the region.

Ein Experte spricht von einer möglichen Straftat. Rheinmetall weist Kritik zurück. Recherche mit Correctiv.</p><p>Für den Rüstungskonzern <a href="https://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/news/themen/rheinmetall-4131680.html">Rheinmetall</a> ist das Geschäft mit den Militärs im Nahen Osten ist wichtig - so wichtig, dass die Konzernherren dafür einen eigenen Statthalter eingesetzt haben. Er residiert im 14. Stock eines Büroturms in bester Lage von Abu Dhabi in den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten (VAE). Von dort soll er den Überblick behalten über die verzweigten Geschäfte, die Rheinmetall in der Region unterhält. Kein leichter Job – aber am frühen Morgen des 16. Februar 2017 kündigte der Statthalter einen besonders gewagten Schritt an, per E-Mail: die Lieferung von Rüstungstechnologie nach Eritrea.</p><p>Die Mail vom Februar 2017 gehört zu einer Sammlung von Dokumenten, die der <em>stern </em>und das Recherchezentrum <a href="https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/korruption/2019/11/07/rheinmetall-celle/">Correctiv</a> einsehen konnten. Es geht um Marinegeschütze des Typs MLG 27, die Rheinmetall im schwäbischen Oberndorf baut. Insgesamt 30 von ihnen hatte Rheinmetall seit 2009 an die Emirate geliefert, für Korvetten des Typs Baynunah und Schnellboote der Ghannatha-Klasse. Doch im Jahr 2017 musste sich Rheinmetall mit Mängelrügen der emiratischen Marine auseinandersetzen. In diesem Zusammenhang kündigte der Rheinmetall-Statthalter in Abu Dhabi in seiner Mail vom Februar 2017 an, man habe "einer Bitte der Marine zugestimmt, ein zusätzliches Schiff (in <a href="https://www.stern.de/politik/ausland/themen/eritrea-4156050.html">Eritrea</a>!) mit unserem Upgrade-Set umzurüsten, um ihnen in ihrer Mission zu helfen".</p><p>Wie gesagt: Rheinmetall weist den Vorwurf des Embargobruchs zurück. Aber der Tübinger Anwalt und Rüstungsexperte Holger Rothbauer fordert nun die Ermittler auf, sich des Falls anzunehmen: „Bei Rheinmetall war bekannt, dass die Ausfuhr von Rüstungstechnologie in ein Embargoland wie Eritrea gegen geltendes Außenhandelsrecht verstieß“, sagte der Anwalt. „Damit haben die Verantwortlichen offenbar mit Vorsatz gehandelt und somit möglicherweise eine Straftat begangen. Bei ihr wäre bereits der Versuch strafbar. Darum muss hier jetzt die zuständige Staatsanwaltschaft von Amts wegen ermitteln.“</p><p><a href="https://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/news/rheinmetall-wollte-geschuetze-auf-kriegsschiff-in-eritrea-nachruesten-8987214.html">https://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/news/rheinmetall-wollte-geschuetze-auf-kriegsschiff-in-eritrea-nachruesten-8987214.html</a> = <a href="https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/korruption/2019/11/07/rheinmetall-celle/">https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/korruption/2019/11/07/rheinmetall-celle/</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp12 Andere Länder / Other countries</span></h2><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>In the course of less than a week since November 1, over 25 </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bahrain?src=hashtag_click"><span>#Bahrain</span></a><span>'i youths (and counting) have been arrested without cause across various villages in the course of the AlKhalifa regime's latest wide-scale spree of arbitrary arrests (photos)</span></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/PrintempsArabeS/status/1192178336874803201">https://twitter.com/PrintempsArabeS/status/1192178336874803201</a></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>DUBAI RULER ACCUSED OF CHILD ABUSE AT LONDON’S HIGH COURT</p><p>Protesters descended on England’s High Court yesterday (4 November) for the 20-month anniversary of the illegal kidnap of Sheikha Latifa Al Maktoum, the daughter of the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum.</p><p>The protesters were awaiting the arrival of the Dubai ruler at the High Court ahead of a fourth hearing of a bitter custody battle over Sheikh Mohammed’s young children with Princess Haya bint Hussein.
