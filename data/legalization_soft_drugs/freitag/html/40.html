According to the expert, they are added to other tasks by the monarchy in matters of foreign policy since the coronation of Salman bin Abdulaziz.</p><p>Since then, the Saudi kingdom began to move to the rhythm of Bin Salman, who promoted himself as the promoter of the modernization of one of the most conservative and closed countries in the world. They are attributed from the restriction of powers to the religious police to the possibility that women drive cars, attend soccer games and even practice it. To advance on his way to the throne, the heir has been carrying out a purge since 2017 that took behind bars an uncertain number of family members who could threaten his aspirations.</p><p>The support that Bin Salman received in the West for the reforms he was announcing, including the productive diversification of his country, began to be nuanced as other facets of his imprint became known. For example, it is not in his plans so far to modify the prohibition that weighs on women to leave the country "without parental authorization, from a husband or older son, as the case may be" or the possibility "of working in some sectors". But above all, it was geopolitical aspects that motivated declarations of condemnation. The intensity of the war in Yemen, the attempt to isolate Qatar and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Arab consulate in Turkey in October 2018, are some examples.</p><p><span><a href="https://mundo.sputniknews.com/radio_telescopio/202003161090804715-de-yemen-a-la-guerra-petrolera-un-fracaso-tras-otro-de-arabia-saudi/">https://mundo.sputniknews.com/radio_telescopio/202003161090804715-de-yemen-a-la-guerra-petrolera-un-fracaso-tras-otro-de-arabia-saudi/</a> </span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Saudi?src=hashtag_click">#Saudi</a></span><span> Mabahith are threatening my family &amp; are sending me indirect messages that if i do not stop talking, my family will end up in prison like others in AlHair &amp; Thahban prsions.

But this is no coincidence. Both events are arguably evidence that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman remains as keen to assert the kingdom’s leadership beyond its own borders as he is to consolidate his own leadership at home.</p><p>This economic uncertainty may yet spell trouble for Mohammad bin Salman. He has spearheaded recent campaigns to persuade both ordinary citizens and business tycoons to buy shares in Saudi Aramco. He has also long advocated more privatisation and financialisation of the Saudi economy. In the recession that could now potentially come, such shifts make economies more vulnerable to shocks. On top of these, a prolonged fall in oil prices could translate into significant strains on the investment projects envisioned in Mohammad bin Salman’s flagship Vision 2030 and the welfare programmes that the Saudi state traditionally offers its citizens. Dramatic leadership abroad could backfire on him at home.</p><p>Against this backdrop peaked the royal court’s sensitivity to criticism and disagreements around Mohammad bin Salman’s strategies.</p><p>Indeed, whether there was an active coup on the cards or not, increasingly it appears that Mohammad bin Salman is in a rush to take the throne. Securing a transition while King Salman – his staunchest ally – is alive would undoubtedly make challenges in the Allegiance Council and the state’s structures much less likely. King Salman would retire and remain Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, and his son, who has been his right-hand man since 2009, will take the role his father has long wanted for him. Having a particularly friendly president in the White House, such as Donald Trump, would be another crucial factor, especially given how all the major Democratic contenders for the US presidential nomination have been very critical of the US-Saudi alliance, with Bernie Sanders publicly calling Saudi leaders <span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/bernie-sanders-calls-saudi-arabias-rulers-murderous-thugs">“murderous thugs”</a></span>.</p><p>Individuals close to Mohammad bin Salman’s circles have long talked about Saudi Arabia’s leadership of the G20 this November as an opportune moment for the transition.</p><p>However, what the Saudi leadership apparently chooses to ignore is that moves such as engaging in an oil price war during a health epidemic, or pre-emptively cracking down within the royal family and state institutions, are deeply concerning to world leaders –by Cinzia Bianco</p><p><span><a href="https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_saudi_arabia_reshuffles_palace_and_oil_markets">https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_saudi_arabia_reshuffles_palace_and_oil_markets</a></span></p><p><span>(A E P)</span></p><p><span>Saudi Aramco zahlt Rekorddividende trotz Gewinneinbruch</span></p><p>Trotz des Ölpreiskriegs zahlt Saudi Aramco so viel Geld an seine Investoren wie kein anderer Konzern.

It is an engaging work that does a very good job of describing Mohammed bin Salman’s rise to power and his destructive policies, and Hubbard combines this with his own experiences in reporting in Saudi Arabia and Yemen to paint a picture of an increasingly repressive state ruled by an impulsive and inexperienced prince. There is a telling quote from the relative of one of the Ritz-Carlton detainees that describes the crown prince in the most unflattering terms:</p><p>“He is a psycho. He has spite. He wants to break people. He doesn’t want anyone to have an honorable name but him,” she told me. “He is a devil, and the devil is learning from him.” (pp. xvii)</p><p>Given the subject of the book, it would have been easy for Hubbard’s account to become a polemic, but he does not do that. He writes very matter-of-factly about how the crown prince maneuvered his way to the top of the Saudi government, and he delivers a fair accounting of what the crown prince has done with the power he has amassed. Hubbard weaves together the story of Mohammed bin Salman’s rise to power with that of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi insider-turned critic and <em>Washington Post</em> columnist whom the crown prince had murdered in October 2018. The book concludes with the gruesome murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and the ensuing international backlash against the kingdom. Khashoggi’s murder is just the most egregious example of the repression and cruelty that have defined Mohammed bin Salman’s tenure. Hubbard puts it this way:</p><p>His murder crystallized, and made it harder to ignore, the ruthlessness of the MBS era: the uncounted deaths in Yemen; the kidnapping of a foreign prime minister; the lock-up at the Ritz; the arrests and torture of activists and clerics; and the harsh, new, with-us-or-against-us environment that considered those who did not cheer, or cheer loudly enough, enemies.

We have worn out our welcome with our repeated illegal attacks, and keeping troops in the country against their wishes is tempting fate. As long as U.S. forces remain in Iraq, Iraqi militias will launch attacks and the U.S. will respond with more strikes. “Deterrence” isn’t going to be “restored” when the Iraqis launching these attacks won’t be dissuaded from launching more attacks – by Daniel Larison</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/withdraw-from-iraq-now/">https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/withdraw-from-iraq-now/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p><span>So Much For ‘Restoring Deterrence’</span></p><p>Ever since the U.S. killed Soleimani and Kata’ib Hezbollah’s Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, more retaliation against U.S. forces has just been a matter of time. It turns out that yesterday was Soleimani’s birthday, so the rocket attack was presumably intended to serve as a response to his killing. The decision to escalate against Iraqi militias and Iran at the start of the year was a reckless and illegal one, and it is one that two Americans and one British soldier have now paid for with their lives. This will keep happening until the administration takes U.S. forces out of Iraq.</p><p>U.S. troops should have left Iraq already. The Iraqi government does not want them there, U.S. security does not require them to be there, and as long as they remain they will be at risk of attack from Iraqi militias. Our continued military presence in Iraq against the wishes of their government puts our troops in an untenable position, and it represents an affront to Iraq’s sovereignty. Repeated attacks on Iraqi militias are direct violations of that sovereignty, and they are bound to put American forces there in greater danger the longer that they stay there. There will be more tit-for-tat attacks, and the U.S. military presence will only become more unpopular as time goes by.</p><p>The last thing that the U.S. or Iran needs right now is escalation with Iran and its proxies. Both of our countries are dealing with the effects of the pandemic, and neither can afford the added costs and dangers of armed conflict. The attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq prove that reckless U.S. actions in January did not “restore deterrence,” and by killing Soleimani and al-Muhandis the U.S. exposed our troops to greater danger than they faced before.

This merger poses a significant destabilization threat throughout the Arabian Peninsula.</p><p>Though Yemen still maintains vestiges of its tribal history, they are less pronounced than in Somalia. This allows al-Qaeda to utilize <span><a href="https://sofrep.com/news/special-air-services-secret-war-oman-part-3/">Yemen as an ideological base</a></span>.</p><p>Al-Qaeda’s Saudi Arabian affiliate has significant media outlets from which it spreads ideological propaganda. The merger allowed the two affiliates to pool resources and reach a broader audience of potential recruits. The recent elimination of Qasim al-Rimi, the leader of AQAP, may end up slowing the growth of the group. Al-Rimi had committed unconscionable violent acts against civilians in Yemen and sought to conduct and inspire numerous attacks against the United States and its forces. President Trump believes <span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-from-the-president-13/">that the elimination of al-Rimi</a></span> will bring us closer to removing the threats this group poses to our national security.</p><p>AQAP’s media output shows how al-Qaeda tries to make different ideas, beliefs, myths, and traditions work to <span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pUq4Wo1zSt0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=media+output+shows+how+al-Qaeda+tries+to+make+different+ideas,+beliefs,+myths,+and+traditions+work+to+radicalize+and+mobilize+the+population&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1RMrBQ_O0d&amp;sig=ACfU3U29sDhECYHQ5FJrn6QGCs3HRIMVqw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjKvKWHnZjoAhXqlnIEHZYyDBUQ6AEwAXoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=media%20output%20shows%20how%20al-Qaeda%20tries%20to%20make%20different%20ideas%2C%20beliefs%2C%20myths%2C%20and%20traditions%20work%20to%20radicalize%20and%20mobilize%20the%20population&amp;f=false">radicalize and mobilize the population</a></span>. These media outlets not only identify grievances and assign blame; they also outline actions necessary to correct the problems. By doing so, AQAP has managed to rise above many of the previous tribal and economic divisions and unite a growing number of Yemenis to its cause.</p><p>A shared grievance narrative has led to claims by Yemeni analysts that while al-Qaeda may number in the hundreds, there are tens of thousands of Yemenis who share its grievances. With potentially thousands of recruits, AQAP poses a severe threat to international security despite the death of al-Rimi. Furthermore, Yemen’s weakened state is more useful to the group’s purposes than a completely collapsed state, such as in Somalia, would be. AQAP walks a tight wire in inciting grievances and mobilizing citizens, yet not being the catalyst behind total civil collapse.</p><p>Within this balancing act lie the success and failure of AQAP’s objectives. The weakened Yemeni government is an invitation for al-Qaeda, whereas the growth of the government’s strength and authority among the population would prove inhospitable – By John Black, a retired US Special Forces "Green Beret" with more than 20 years of experience in the military at both 5th SFG(A) and 3rd SFG(A). </p><p><span><a href="https://sofrep.com/news/al-qaedas-bastions-of-power-somalia-and-yemen/">https://sofrep.com/news/al-qaedas-bastions-of-power-somalia-and-yemen/</a></span></p><p>and also <span><a href="https://debriefer.net/en/news-15656.html">https://debriefer.net/en/news-15656.html</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp15 Propaganda</span></h2><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>‘Virus at Iran’s gates’: How Tehran failed to stop outbreak</span></p><p><span>Harirchi’s story is a microcosm of what has happened in Iran amid the coronavirus pandemic.

of the Joint Incident Assessment Team (JIAT) of the Arab Coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the Emirates said it had reached regarding targeting the Community College in the Dhamar governorate on 1 September 2019, in which more than 130 detained civilians and POW were killed and 40 others were injured, are not neutral findings.</p><p>SAM added that the statement issued on Tuesday, March 11, by the Legal Adviser of the JIAT, reflects a desperate attempt to justify and whitewashing the Coalition targeting of civilians over the past years, where the statement indicated that the airstrike targeted a legitimate military target after being seized by Houthis armed militia and turned it into (drones stores, air defence missiles and military vehicles depot) without listing evidence supporting its allegations or how it was certain about existence of such depot as stated in the statement of the JIAT.</p><p>"SAM stated that it is through the documentation that it had conducted following the attack by the Saudi-led Arab Coalition, and interview of former detainees and the families of the victims, which confirmed that the building that the Coalition aircraft targeted with a number of missiles was a civilian educational building that the Houthis militia turned into a detention centre for enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention of opponents in which torture was practiced, which refutes the account of the JIAT to being a military facility for launching drones, and on the assumption that it is in a part used for military purposes such as that mentioned in the team assessment, targeting it have violated the rules of international law and the Geneva Convention related to the principle of proportionality and necessity in targeting the Community College.</p><p>SAM organization regrets JIAT’s, the authorities responsible for issuing the raid permit as well as the officers involved in the attacks, ignoring of the legal and criminal consequences of such a raid that targeted the community college.

our age of overlapping crises, it shouldn’t be a surprise that climate change can be identified as a factor in the upsurge, the technical term used for such a natural disaster that is just below plague. It began in 2018, when a pair of cyclones came in from the Indian Ocean and hit the “empty quarter” of the Arabian peninsula — the vast desert region near the borders of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman.</p><p>To help understand the crisis, <em>Intelligencer</em> spoke with the FAO’s Cressman about some of the bugs’ idiosyncrasies and what to expect in the coming months.</p><p><em>What about states in open conflict or with major security issues, like Yemen or Somalia?</em></p><p>Yemen is very critical because it’s a frontline country for desert locusts. Desert locusts are there every year, and there’s a number of different breeding areas along the coast in the wintertime in the interior. It’s a country that has a really spectacular habitat for desert locusts, and when it rains, those locusts take advantage of it.</p><p>That’s probably one of the reasons why the locust infestation shifted from the empty corridor in 2019 across to the Horn of Africa in the summer, because they stopped off in Yemen for a generation of breeding in the spring. Because of the conflict, there’s very little that can be done. It’s just not safe for the national locust teams to to operate throughout the country to undertake the survey for control operations. There are a few limited areas they can work in, but it simply isn’t enough.</p><p><span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/a-u-n-locust-forecaster-explains-the-crisis-in-east-africa.html">https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/a-u-n-locust-forecaster-explains-the-crisis-in-east-africa.html</a></span></p><p>(-)</p><p>Hadramaut, 32 photos</p><p><span><a href="https://www.raoul-kieffer.net/de/Wadi-Hadramaut">https://www.raoul-kieffer.net/de/Wadi-Hadramaut</a></span></p><p><span>(-)</span></p><p><span>Photo: A morning from above, </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hadramout?src=hashtag_click">#Hadramout</a></span><span> like never before!</span></p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/HanaalShowafi/status/1239092428260376576">https://twitter.com/HanaalShowafi/status/1239092428260376576</a></span></p><p>(C)</p><p>Film: The History of Modern Yemen: Every Year</p><p>See the progression of Yemen since the 1800s as the small sultanates were eventually colonized then divided then united and then divided again.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saNi7bS-KQM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saNi7bS-KQM</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vorige / Previous:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-632-yemen-war-mosaic-632/">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/jemenkrieg-mosaik-632-yemen-war-mosaic-632/</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 1-632 / Yemen War Mosaic 1-632:</span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose</a> oder / or <a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Der saudische Luftkrieg im Bild / Saudi aerial war images:</span></h2><p><span>(18 +, Nichts für Sensible!) / (18 +; Graphic!)</span></p><p><span><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/">http://yemenwarcrimes.blogspot.de/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="http://www.yemenwar.info/">http://www.yemenwar.info/</a> </span></p><p>Liste aller Luftangriffe / and list of all air raids:</p><p><span><a href="http://yemendataproject.org/data/">http://yemendataproject.org/data/</a></span></p><p>Untersuchung ausgewählter Luftangriffe durch Bellingcat / Bellingcat investigations of selected air raids:</p><p><span><a href="https://yemen.bellingcat.com/">https://yemen.bellingcat.com/</a></span></p><p><span>Untersuchungen von Angriffen, hunderte von Filmen / Investigations of attacks, hundreds of films:</span></p><p><span><a href="https://yemeniarchive.org/en">https://yemeniarchive.org/en</a></span></p></div>
