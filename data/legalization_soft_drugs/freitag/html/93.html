Politicians and media in the West, in particular, also frequently describe them as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/iran-saudi-proxy-war-yemen-crisis">Iranian proxies</a>.</p><p>Yet <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2346.12599/abstract">as I argue in a recent article</a> in the May 2016 issue of International Affairs, the Chatham House journal, Tehran’s support for the Houthis is limited, and its influence in Yemen is marginal. It is simply inaccurate to claim that the Houthis are Iranian proxies.</p><p>Instead, the war in Yemen is driven by <a href="http://www.thecairoreview.com/tahrir-forum/unraveling-yemens-civil-war/">local grievances</a> and competition for power among Yemeni actors. The Houthis and Saleh want to overturn the political order that emerged after the uprisings of 2011: Saleh wants to return to power, having lost the presidency in the wake of popular protests, while the Houthis want a greater say in national affairs. In other words, the Houthis want in, Saleh wants back in, and the Hadi bloc wants to keep them both out.</p><p>According to a 2015 report to the U.N. Security Council Iran Sanctions Committee, Iran probably started providing <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/iran-arming-yemens-huthi-rebels-2009-un-report-1170499355">small amounts of weapons to the Houthis in 2009</a> — five years after the first round of fighting between the Houthis and government forces. In 2011, U.S. officials — who until then had been dismissive of such accusations — started to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/world/middleeast/aiding-yemen-rebels-iran-seeks-wider-mideast-role.html">acknowledge that Iran</a> was likely responsible for the delivery of automatic rifles, grenade launchers and cash, probably in the millions of dollars.</p><p>The Houthi’s takeover of Sanaa, Yemen’s capital, in September 2014 prompted Iran to increase its support. It now appears that small numbers — perhaps dozens — of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officers, with assistance from Lebanese Hezbollah, have set up a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/27/us-yemen-security-houthis-iran-idUSKBN0MN2MI20150327">train and equip</a> program for the Houthis. There have also been reports of <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/120e161c-ff1d-11e4-8dd4-00144feabdc0.html">intensifying shipping activity</a> between Iran and Yemen.</p><p>This assistance, however, remains limited and far from sufficient to make more than a marginal difference to the balance of forces in Yemen, a country <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/gun-control-yemen-style/273058/">awash with weapons</a>. There is therefore no supporting evidence to the claim that Iran has bought itself any significant measure of influence over Houthi decision-making.</p><p>Iran’s investment in Yemen has been limited; it has therefore brought only limited influence.

Little is clear about the Houthi leadership, aside from the fact that Abdulmalik al-Houthi is the rebel group's current leader. Houthi field commanders do not seem to agree on key ideological and religious principles. The Houthis' numbers range from the hundreds to the thousands, though it is difficult to determine how many of these adhere to Houthi ideology and how many are tribesmen who have joined the Houthis' fight for other reasons. Numerous organizations have documented the Houthis' use of child soldiers, as well as violations of international humanitarian law such as looting, forced evacuations, and executions. Contrary to ROYG claims that Iran is arming the Houthis, most analysts report that the Houthis obtain their weapons from the Yemeni black market and even from the ROYG military itself.

(S/NF) Contrary to ROYG claims that Iran is arming the Houthis, most local political analysts report that the Houthis obtain their weapons from the Yemeni black market and even from the ROYG military itself. According to a British diplomat, there are numerous credible reports that ROYG military commanders were selling weapons to the Houthis in the run-up to the Sixth War. An ICG report on the Sa'ada conflict from May 2009 quoted NSB director Ali Mohammed al-Ansi saying, "Iranians are not arming the Houthis. The weapons they use are Yemeni. Most actually come from fighters who fought against the socialists during the 1994 war and then sold them." Mohammed Azzan, presidential advisor for Sa'ada affairs, told PolOff on August 16 that the Houthis easily obtain weapons inside Yemen, either from battlefield captures or by buying them from corrupt military commanders and soldiers. Azzan said that the military "covers up its failure" by saying the weapons come from Iran. According to Jamal Abdullah al-Shami of the Democracy School, there is little external oversight of the military's large and increasing budget, so it is easy for members of the military to illegally sell weapons. 13. (S/NF) ROYG officials assert that the Houthis' possession and use of Katyusha rockets is evidence of support from Iran and Hizballah, arguing that these rockets are not available in Yemeni arms markets nor ROYG stockpiles. (Comment: Given Yemen's robust arms markets, especially in Sa'ada, it is possible that Katyushas are available on the black market even if they are not in ROYG stockpiles. According to sensitive reporting, there is at least one instance of Somali extremists purchasing Katyusha rockets in Yemen in 2007. End Comment.) However, according to sensitive reporting, it may have been the ROYG military who aided the Houthis in obtaining a shipment of 200 Katyusha rockets in late November 2009 – by Stephen Seche, Ambassador</p><p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANAA2186_a.html">https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANAA2186_a.html</a></p><p>Comment by Haykal Bafana: The US Government knows this, as its leaked diplomatic cable shows.

Ahmad al-Assiri told National Public Radio (NPR) in an <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/05/16/478188314/saudi-arabia-regrets-civilian-casualties-during-operations-in-yemen">interview</a> that aired this morning.<br /> He was responding to a question about a March 15, 2016 airstrike on a market in the northern Yemeni town of Mastaba that killed at least 97 civilians. A colleague and I had visited the site in late March and found remnants of a United States-supplied 2,000 pound bomb, one of several used in the attack. We even shot a video in the demolished market. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS7sxaXVw4">On camera I say</a>, “I am standing here in the remains of Mastaba market….”</p><p>Human Rights Watch <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/07/yemen-us-bombs-used-deadliest-market-strike">published</a> a report on our findings, calling on the Saudis to investigate the apparently unlawful attack – a possible war crime. It was one of the deadliest single attacks in the campaign by the Saudi-led coalition to oust northern Houthi rebels and their allies from the capital, Sanaa, and other areas. At least <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17146&amp;LangID=E">3,000 civilians have died</a> over the past year, most from airstrikes.</p><p>NPR host Mary Louise Kelly pressed the general on Human Rights Watch’s findings: “They went, they saw it.”</p><p>“No,” al-Assiri responded. “No one get[s] to Yemen without permission of the coalition.” He added that he hopes “Human Right Watch and the other NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] come to the coalition for permission. We will send them down to investigate.”</p><p>In fact, this two-week trip was the fourth I had made to Yemen since the beginning of the war in March 2015. Given what I go through to get into Yemen, al-Assiri’s statement was laughable. Since the war started, all Yemenia Airway flights to Sanaa touch down in Saudi Arabia, where Saudi immigration officers board the plane, search the baggage, and selectively question passengers. Each time, I was one of the only passengers to have my passport confiscated for the layover, without a word of explanation. The Saudis know every time I visit Yemen.</p><p>But there’s nothing laughable about the situation in Yemen. Over the course of my trips, I’ve investigated dozens of airstrikes by the coalition that have killed at least 670 civilians, as well as other serious abuses by all the parties to the conflict. We and other human rights groups have been on the ground investigating them. Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners have an obligation under the laws of war to investigate alleged violations by their forces – but there’s no indication they’ve done so.</p><p>General al-Assiri has been in Washington, DC this month, no doubt to drum up support for resupplying the bombs dropped on Mastaba and elsewhere, and other weapons. There’s no reason to believe that what he says about alleged coalition atrocities is any more accurate than his portrayal of Human Rights Watch investigations. US lawmakers genuinely concerned about the well-being of the Yemeni people, and how they view the United States, might want to keep this in mind – by Belkis Wille</p><p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/16/dispatches-saudi-spokesman-denies-human-rights-watchs-yemen-findings">https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/16/dispatches-saudi-spokesman-denies-human-rights-watchs-yemen-findings</a></p><p>Comment: More on the Asiri interview in cp15, propaganda. That is the level Saudi propaganda – and Asiri in special – permanently are arguing at: HRW was not in Yemen, because we are those who must permit anybody to get to Yemen and they did not come to us to ask for permission.</p><p><strong>16.5.2016 – The American Conservative (** A K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Saudi Lies and the War on Yemen</strong></p><p>In fact, Human Rights Watch is one of several organizations that documented likely war crimes carried out by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. It is true that the Saudis make it very difficult for outside groups and journalists to gain access to the country because they don’t want this to be known, and they deliberately stymied an independent investigation into war crimes in Yemen at the U.N. with U.S. and allied acquiescence. Nonetheless, HRW and others have investigated the <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/the-indefensible-war-on-yemen-continues-4/">effects</a> of the coalition’s <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/07/yemen-coalition-drops-cluster-bombs-capital-0">indiscriminate bombing</a> <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/10/13/tragic-civilian-toll-airstrikes-yemen">campaign</a> along with the crimes committed by all parties to the conflict. They have <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/the-war-on-yemen-continues-to-be-ignored/">ample proof</a> that the Saudi-led coalition has carried out numerous strikes on civilian areas in violation of international law.</p><p>The Saudis have moved from brazenly denying that civilians were killed by their attacks to feigning concern for the victims, but it doesn’t change that they have been working overtime to avoid accountability for their crimes over the last year. Unfortunately, they were able to use this interview to do the same thing.</p><p>The other troubling thing about this interview is that the Saudi spokesman isn’t pressed on any of his statements, and he is asked the softest, least challenging questions imaginable under the circumstances. When he claims that his government views Yemenis as neighbors, an appropriate response might have been: “So why have you been starving your neighbors with a blockade for the last thirteen months?” Regrettably, the coalition’s blockade and its effects are never mentioned in the interview. The interviewer also asks whether the “Saudi intervention has improved things,” but that is the wrong question to ask. The spokesman should have been forced to defend the enormous harm that the intervention has plainly done and the yawning gap between the coalition’s stated goals and what it has done. The interviewer mentions that thousands of those killed since last March have been civilians, but neglects to inform the audience that most of these have been killed by coalition bombs – by Daniel Larison</p><p><a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/saudi-lies-and-the-war-on-yemen/">http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/saudi-lies-and-the-war-on-yemen/</a> on this subject, see also <a href="http://www.al-bab.com/blog/2016/may/yemen-saudi-war-crimes.htm">http://www.al-bab.com/blog/2016/may/yemen-saudi-war-crimes.htm</a></p><p><strong>16.5.2016 – London School of Economics (** A P)</strong></p><p><strong>Beyond the North/South narrative: Conflict and federalism in Eastern Yemen</strong></p><p>Mainstream representations are accustomed to viewing Yemen either as a country fragmented along the North/South or as a nation divided into two principal religious group, Sunni and Shi’a. Although salient, these cleavages cannot fully explain the complexity of the Yemeni scenario. For instance, the South is not a homogenous actor because there are regional and tribal identities to feed local agendas. In Yemen, the Civil War in 1994 and then the 2011 Arab uprising have exacerbated the dynamic yet convoluted conflict, which has compelled several Yemenis to call for regional autonomy. This complicated situation is particularly evident in south-eastern, Sunni-populated governorates of Hadhramaut and Al-Mahra.</p><p>Yemen’s ‘far East’ has always been marginalised by the central, northern-driven elite, especially on issues concerning revenue redistribution, economic opportunities, and political representation. At the same time, Hadhrami and Mahri clans use to nurture a proud sense of distinctiveness from the rest of Yemen.</p><p>Tribes seem to be firmly against this federal draft [proposed in 2014 as part of a new Yemeni constitution; a political solution the Hadi government and the GCC still want to go on with].</p><p>According to a 2013 survey by <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/oxford-to-yemen-from-literary-scholar-to-tribal-adviser/2014777.article">Elisabeth Kendall, an Oxford-based leading scholar on Eastern Yemen</a>, 99% of 34,000 respondents rejected the proposal to merge with Hadhramaut, while 86% of Mahris wanted to be ruled by a cross-tribal council, opposing both the ˊunited Yemenˋ and the ˊSouth Yemenˋ hypothesis.</p><p>Therefore, the implementation of the suggested federal text would likely fuel additional tribal animosity toward Sana’a, thus increasing the security vacuum in the South. In such a scenario, jihadi groups such as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) could easily capitalise on local resentment and anti-northern prejudice.</p><p>The stability of southeastern Yemen is vital for the Gulf’s security too. Including the control of coastal Hadhramaut .</p><p>Yemen’s political unity remains highly uncertain, but the federal solution appears to be the only prudent solution to the impasse – by Eleonora Ardemagni</p><p><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mec/2016/05/16/beyond-the-northsouth-narrative-conflict-and-federalism-in-eastern-yemen/">http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mec/2016/05/16/beyond-the-northsouth-narrative-conflict-and-federalism-in-eastern-yemen/</a></p><p>Comment: the situation in the neglected South East: one more argument against a Hadi government continuing it’s 2014 federal reform project, as in this form it also did not confirm to the wishes of the Yemeni South East. A completely new solution is necessary, which can be only a federal one off course.</p><p><strong>18.5.2016 – Amnesty International (** B H P)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen: Spree of arbitrary arrests, disappearances and torture by Huthi forces</strong></p><p>The Huthi armed group, supported by state security forces, has carried out a wave of arrests of its opponents, arbitrarily seizing critics at gunpoint and subjecting some to enforced disappearance as part of a chilling campaign to quash dissent in areas of Yemen under its control, said Amnesty International in a new report published today.</p><p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde31/4006/2016/en/"><em>Where is my father? Detention and disappearance in Huthi-controlled Yemen</em></a>, which is based on 60 cases of detention examined in detail by the organization, reveals a pattern of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances in Sana’a, Ibb, Ta’iz and Hodeidah between December 2014 and March 2016. Those targeted include political opposition figures, human rights defenders, journalists, academics and others. Many have been held incommunicado for prolonged periods, suffered torture and other ill-treatment and been denied access to a lawyer or their family.</p><p>“Huthi forces have presided over a brutal and deliberate campaign targeting their political opponents and other critics since December 2014. Hundreds of people have been rounded up and held without charge or trial, and in some cases they have been forcibly disappeared in flagrant violation of international law,” said James Lynch, Deputy Director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Amnesty International.</p><p>“Enforced disappearance is an abhorrent crime and cannot be justified under any circumstances. Instead of incarcerating opponents for weeks or months on end, the Huthi armed group should release anyone who has been arbitrarily detained, implement safeguards to ensure detainees are treated humanely and issue clear instructions that anyone under their command committing abuses will be held accountable.”</p><p>In the vast majority of cases those detained were given no reason for their arrest. Some prisoners have been held for up to 17 months without being brought before a prosecutor or a judge. None of the detainees featured in the report were ever officially charged or given an opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of their detention. Huthi officials told Amnesty International in May 2016 that those in detention were being held “because they gave GPS coordinates to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition”.</p><p>Amnesty International has obtained documents which show that prosecuting authorities in Sana’a have found the detention of dozens of political activists, journalists and others to be without legal basis and have ordered their release, apparently to no effect.</p><p>Many detainees have been held in secret, makeshift detention centres, including private homes and have been transferred multiple times between different locations. Eighteen individuals whose cases are featured in Amnesty International’s report are still being held. The whereabouts of three of them are unknown.</p><p>The report includes distressing accounts from former detainees, and from family members of detainees, who described to Amnesty International the use of torture and other ill-treatment in detention.</p><p>One former detainee, who was among 25 men including journalists, activists and human rights defenders who were arbitrarily arrested from the Ibb Garden Hotel in October 2015, described to Amnesty International how his interrogators tortured him for 90 minutes. He was blindfolded with his hands tied together and beaten all over his body with a stick. The interrogators also gave him electric shocks to the chest, neck, forearms and groin.</p><p>The majority of those targeted are activists, journalists or other figures affiliated with al-Islah, a Sunni Islamist political party which opposed the Huthi takeover of power and announced its support for the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in April 2015. However, in some cases those detained had no known political affiliation or history that could explain why they were targeted.

If Egyptians chanted for the departure of their despot: President Husne Mubarak, Yemenis only ever called for reforms … at least in the beginning, when the “revolutionary movement” was still organic and truly popular in its nature.</p><p>It was foreign powers which engineered popular anger into a political weapon, so that Saleh’s regime would fall. President Saleh you see had outlived its sell-by date and had become somewhat irrelevant. When I say Saleh’s regime, I mean the entirety of his regime – including the so-called Opposition.</p><p>Allow me to elaborate – bear in mind that I will cut corners to summarize Yemen’s political set up. Many books could be written on Yemen politicking!</p><p>So … back in 2011 Yemen’s political, military and tribal political structure was divided in between two juggernauts: the General People’s Congress (al-Motamar aka President Saleh’s political faction) and al-Islah which acted an umbrella for various right-wing Islamic groups: including the now notorious Muslim Brotherhood, and tribal leaders close to Riyadh’s Wahhabi clergy.</p><p>I you recall I previously explained how al-Islah’s rise to power correspond almost exactly to the Houthis state-organized persecution, and Yemen’s Secession war in 1994. While the Houthis did not yet represent a military threat in that they were just a tribe of northern Yemen, it is their Zaidism, their determination to remain true to Yemen’s religious tradition and their rejection of Wahhabism which prompted Riyadh’s wrath.</p><p>Al-Islah was always meant as a buffer against both President Saleh’s power and Zaidism.</p><p>Headed by al-Ahmar’s tribe, al-Islah became an extension of Riyadh’s power in Yemen, the contender in many ways to President Saleh’s own tribe, and own family. While Saleh appointed his own family members to Yemen’s key military and political positions, he still had to accommodate al-Islah and offer its leadership a share of the political pie. As the decades rolled in, Yemen came to be governed by both al-Ahmar, and the Saleh. Smack down in the middle was Yemen.</p><p>Yemen 2011 uprising came to upset this balance of power. Yemen uprising was engineered to upset this balance of power, so that a new one could rise. If Yemen’s political awakening came as a surprise to both the Saudis and the Americans, it also offered an opportunity neither could pass on. It is often from chaos that new order can be shaped and moulded to existence. 2011 was meant to introduce a new order to Southern Arabia … If not for the arrival of the Houthis, Riyadh would have succeeded in bringing Yemen to kneel to its imperial will.</p><p>But why would Riyadh want President Saleh gone when its officials did everything they could to protect him? Good question! Did they though …. Who did they protect? The man, or the power he represented? You see while Riyadh might have cared little for Saleh’s life, he was still the guardian of a legitimacy the kingdom could not accept to see threaten. More importantly President Saleh had been earmarked to transition Yemen into Riyadh’s hands – Saudi Arabia understood only too well how quickly Yemen could have fallen into real chaos if not for a strong hand to hold it together. Chaos was only allowed if directed properly.</p><p>While I will not claim to have been privy to Riyadh’s political whispers, I will venture a theory on why Riyadh wanted to see Saleh gone. It wasn’t so much President Saleh who represented a threat but his appointed successor: General Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh - the president’s eldest son and head of the now-debunked Republican Guards. A central military figure, Gen. Ahmed Saleh was … and still is, a well-loved figure. Not only that but the man stands for a Yemen, millions would like to see manifest.</p><p>If the general is very much his father’s son in that he understands the inner and outer politics of Yemen, he is also a modern educated man who wants to see his country reclaim its leading position in Southern Arabia. Where President Saleh was in many ways a tribesman turned president, Gen. Ahmed Saleh is a military man ambitioning to turn Yemen into Arabia’s first functioning republic by taming both tribalism and Wahhabism. Needless to say that the kingdom had an issue with that. Not only does Riyadh want to perpetuate Yemen’s tribalism, since it allows for greater control, but it also wants to see Wahhabism becomes Yemen’s state religion.</p><p>The general’s accession to the presidency would make all the above impossible – hence his fall from political and military grace. General Saleh is now under house arrest in the UAE … Remember that detail because it is awfully important – by Catherine Shakdam</p><p><a href="http://katehon.com/article/muddy-political-waters-where-did-yemens-war-go-wrong">http://katehon.com/article/muddy-political-waters-where-did-yemens-war-go-wrong</a></p><p>Comment: Shakdam’s articles sometimes are a mixture of intelligent analysis and pathetic pro-Houthi propaganda. In this article, she also almost propagates former president Saleh’s son as future president of Yemen. Well, it seems doubtful whether a Saleh offspring really could keep up the unity of Northern and Southern Yemen, could comfort Islah party followers and southern separatists. And, something like a dynastic successorship in presidency hardly is democratic – especially if the father is somebody like former president Saleh, having ruled the country for 35 years and gripped about up to 1 billion Dollars each year of his presidency-</p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp3 Humanitäre Lage / Humanitarian situation</strong></span></h2><p>18.5.2016 – Zeit Online (* A H K)</p><p>UN warnen vor Hungersnot im Jemen</p><p>13 Millionen Jemeniten sind durch den Krieg auf Unterstützung angewiesen, viele hungern oder fliehen.

– UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (* B H)</p><p>OCHA Operations Director warns of consequences of shockingly low funding for Yemen humanitarian crisis, which demands urgent international attention</p><p>After a three-day joint visit to Yemen by OCHA, WHO and WFP, John Ging, Director of Operations in the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, today drew urgent attention to the desperate humanitarian situation in Yemen, which continues to deteriorate more than a year after the conflict escalated.</p><p>Since mid-March 2015, the conflict has prompted a widening protection crisis, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation brought on by years of poverty, poor governance and instability, leaving more than 13 million Yemenis in need of immediate, life-saving humanitarian assistance.</p><p>“Millions of people in Yemen are in increasingly dire need of assistance,” warned Mr. Ging, pointing out that food and nutrition, insecurity and access to healthcare are among the most critical areas of need. “People are dying of preventable illnesses because of the limited availability of even the most basic medical supplies.” Over 7.6 million people are severely food insecure, and 2.5 million people have been displaced by violent conflict since January 2014. “The continued conflict, months of limited imports of essential supplies, and rapidly deteriorating basic services are deepening humanitarian needs,” Mr. Ging told media in New York.</p><p>Last year the humanitarian community delivered vital assistance to 8.8 million women, children and men across the country despite severe restrictions on humanitarian movement and on-going conflict, making all humanitarian support, including the transportation of goods, difficult and often dangerous.</p><p>During the visit, Mr. Ging, with the Emergency Director of WHO, Rick Brennan, and the Deputy Emergency Director of WFP, Gian Carlo Cirri, visited a food distribution site in Amran, a small city in western central Yemen where a high number of internally displaced people are living in very difficult conditions as a result of the crisis. “Seeing the plight of the Yemeni people first hand reinforces the need for national and international humanitarian actors to scale up their response to protect and support the population,” he said.</p><p>Commending national and international humanitarian organizations for their exhaustive and brave work under the leadership of the Humanitarian Coordinator, Jamie McGoldrick, John Ging noted that, “Yemen is one of the most acute humanitarian crises in the world, and the courageous and impressive work of the humanitarian staff is truly inspiring.”</p><p>Mr. Ging made a crucial appeal to the parties of the conflict to prioritize the protection of civilians and civilian needs, and to swiftly enable unhindered humanitarian access so that humanitarian actors have sustained, unhindered and safe access to all people in need, particularly in the governorates of Taizz, Hajjah, Sa’ada, Aden and Al Jawf. “The people of Yemen must be at the centre of this response, and our collective duty is to protect them and provide them with food, health, shelter and other vital support,” said Mr. Ging.</p><p>To the donor community, Mr. Ging appealed for an urgent increase in attention and support for the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, which requires US$1.8 billion to reach over 13 million people this year, but remains shockingly underfunded at only 16 per cent.</p><p><a

I am writing to you on behalf of the Mona Relief Organization, whose interests my office represents.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to the work the Mona Relief Organization (<a href="http://www.monarelief.org/">www.monarelief.org</a>) has carried out in Yemen.</p><p>A Yemen-based NGO, the Mona Relief Organization has, for the past year, run against Saudi Arabia’s blockade, determined to bring hope and humanitarian aid, to those brave souls who have withstood Riyadh’s aggression.</p><p>I don’t need to tell you of the horrors and infamies the kingdom perpetrated against Yemen in the name of control, and imperialism. But beyond this neo-imperial war lies an agenda few have dared speak of: religious genocide. Northern Yemen has been targeted for its religious tradition: Zaidism, has stood in opposition of Wahhabism.</p><p>Under Riyadh’s orders Yemen has been blockaded, and isolated – its people have been made to starve under the patronage of the United Nations, and Western powers, so that the Resistance, led by AnsarAllah could be destroyed.</p><p>Yemen faces a genocide because millions of its people have remained true to the oath of allegiance, they long ago gave to our Imam Ali. It is because Yemen has walked in the footsteps of our beloved Imams that the House of Saud is attempting today to annihilate an entire people. Today I seek help where I know it will be offered.</p><p>While Yemenis are strong, and resilient, they cannot possibly defeat this evil alone. They should not have to either.</p><p>The Mona Relief Organization has worked tirelessly to bring humanitarian aid to those areas most affected by war. Its volunteers have defied air raids, Saudi-bought mercenaries, and al-Qaeda militants to reach cut off communities and stand true to their duty of care.</p><p>Because the Mona Relief Organization has time and time again refused foreign patronage, foreign funding and foreign infiltration, the organization has solely relied on outside donations.</p><p>My office, Veritas-Consulting has campaigned and raised funds so that Yemenis could get the help they so deserve.</p><p>I will kindly ask you today to consider allowing us to run an advert on your website so that people will learn of Yemen’s plight.</p><p>Press TV has already stood by Yemen by allowing for the truth to shine forth. I am asking you today to call on your viewers and your readers to donate to the Mona Relief Organization.</p><p>We are looking for powerful, and generous sponsors, we need your support.</p><p>I would ask you as well to consider allowing a short video appeal to be aired on your network ahead of Ramadan.</p><p>I understand that my request is rather unconventional, but we are not living conventional times. We are living unjust times, and our faith is being targeted. It is in such times of hardship that we ought to draw closer together, and stand for, and by each other. I understand the extent of my request, but Yemen requires drastic actions on our parts.</p><p>Before you answer I beg you to consider the millions of lives which quite literally are dependent on your help.</p><p>Feel free to get in touch with whatever questions you may have.</p><p>Sincerely, Catherine Shakdam</p><p>Director of Programs for the Shafaqna Institute for Middle Eastern Studies, Director and Founder of Veritas-Consulting</p><p>Political analyst &amp; Commentator for the Middle East</p><p><a href="http://en.abna24.com/service/middle-east-west-asia/archive/2016/05/17/754786/story.html">http://en.abna24.com/service/middle-east-west-asia/archive/2016/05/17/754786/story.html</a> and <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/savealifeinyemen">https://www.gofundme.com/savealifeinyemen</a></p><p><strong>17.5.2016 – AP / USA Today (** B H)</strong></p><p><strong>The ‘untouchables’ of Yemen caught in crossfire of war</strong></p><p>They are Yemen’s untouchables.</p><p>They call themselves the “Muhammasheen,” or “the Marginalized,” a dark-skinned ethnic group that for centuries has been consigned to the bottom of Yemen’s social scale</p><p>In a country where belonging to a tribe is vital to guaranteeing protection, status and livelihood, their community — which some estimates say numbers nearly 3 million people — is without a tribe and ignored by the government.</p><p>As a result, they have been hit particularly hard in Yemen’s civil war.</p><p>Their neighborhoods have been pounded both by coalition airstrikes and Houthi shelling, shattering their makeshift homes cobbled together from sheets of metal, cardboard and blankets.</p><p>Many have been thrown into a state of constant displacement, with no one to take them in. Some tell of fleeing from strikes by one side, only to be hit again by another of the many factions and combatants in the conflict. Yemeni groups distributing humanitarian aid ignore them, they say.</p><p>In 2014, UNICEF conducted a survey of more than 9,000 Marginalized families in the city of Taiz, site of one of their largest communities. It found high levels of poverty and low levels of education, all far worse than national averages. Only half the children were in school, 80 percent of the adults and nearly 52 percent of 10-14-year-olds were illiterate. More than half the children under 1 year old had not been immunized.</p><p>Buthaina al-Iryani, social protection specialist at UNICEF, said that the agency distributes cash to the families of the Marginalized in Sanaa and Taiz due to their urgent needs. But she acknowledged, “This is a drop in the ocean.”</p><p>Now after a year of war, they have completely fallen off the social hierarchy.</p><p>More than ever, begging has become their only source of revenue.

Governorates including Taiz, Sa'ada, Hajja, Shabwa, Marib, Al Jawf, Sana'a and Al Bayda were among the most affected in terms of poor supply of commodities in local markets.</p><p>• The national average price of wheat flour was 12% higher than the pre-crisis period (ranging from 4% in Amran to 70% in Taiz). Average price of red beans were 30% higher than pre-crisis (ranging from 12% in Hajja to 99% in Shabwa). Prices of other food items were also more than the pre-crisis levels in most of the governorates.</p><p>• The national average price of fuel remained to be over 50% higher than pre-crisis period - during the reporting period, average price of diesel increased by 35%, price of petrol rose by 55% and that of cooking gas by 65% compared to the pre-crisis levels. The prices of fuel in Taiz continued to be the highest due to the ongoing active conflict while lowest prices recorded in Al Mahra.</p><p>• The poor supply of essential food and non-food commodities coupled with severely reduced income levels due to disruption of livelihoods during the conflict as well as the impact of the devaluation of Yemeni Riyal against US Dollar are expected to worsen the precarious food security situation of millions of vulnerable population in Yemen</p><p><a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-market-situation-update-april-2016">http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-market-situation-update-april-2016</a> and in full: <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/yemen_market_situation_update_-_april_2016.pdf">http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/yemen_market_situation_update_-_april_2016.pdf</a></p><p>15.5.2016 – World Food Programme etc. (A H)</p><p>Yemen - Emergency Food Assistance: Total number of Beneficiaries Targeted/Reached by the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster Partners - April 2016</p><p>Total Number of Beneficiaries in need of Emergency Food Assistance 7.6 M</p><p>Total Number of Beneficiaries Reached 3.6 M</p><p><a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/yem_fsc_foodcv_gap_april2016_a3l.pdf">http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/yem_fsc_foodcv_gap_april2016_a3l.pdf</a></p><p>15.5.2016 – World Food Programme etc. (A H)</p><p>Yemen - Emergency Livelihood (Agriculture Livelihood) Assistance: Total number of Beneficiaries Targeted/Reached by the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster Partners - April 2016</p><p>Total Number of Beneficiaries in need of Emergency Livelihoods Assistance 700,000</p><p>Total Number of Beneficiaries Reached 107,774</p><p><a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/yem_fsc_op_liveliagrigap_april2016.pdf">http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/yem_fsc_op_liveliagrigap_april2016.pdf</a></p><p>15.5.2016 – World Food Programme etc. (A H)</p><p>Yemen - Livelihood Restoration (Agriculture Livelihood) Assistance: Total number of Beneficiaries Targeted/Reached by the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster Partners - April 2016</p><p>Total Number of Beneficiaries in need of Livelihoods Restoration Assistance 500,000 M - Total Number of Beneficiaries Reached 0</p><p><a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/yem_fsc_opliveliresgap_april2016.pdf">http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/yem_fsc_opliveliresgap_april2016.pdf</a></p><p>15.5.2016 – UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (A H)</p><p>Infographic: Yemen, Sa'ada: 3W Humanitarian Presence (as of 21 April 2016)</p><p><a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/3w_saada_april_2016_v2.pdf">http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/3w_saada_april_2016_v2.pdf</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp4 Kulturerbe / Cultural heritage</strong></span></h2><p>1982 – Archnet (* B)</p><p>Earthquakes: The Vulnerability of Traditional Buildings in the Yemen</p><p>The recent earthquake has shown the vulnerability of the traditional buildings and has raised questions concerning the future of building in the Yemen. This paper describes the alien influences arriving after the revolution of 1962. It compares the traditional buildings with thick walls and roofs, suited to the climate, with the imported thin-walled versions. The philosophy of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) at that time is stated, and the efforts of the UNDP personnel assigned to the Ministry of Public Works to adopt a more sympathetic approach is described. The earthquake disaster is bringing in bilateral aid, but if the wrong types of rapid-aid programmes are introduced, it could be the end of the Yemeni traditions. This paper suggests criteria for taking account of the climate and the traditional patterns in building new structures, for allowing public participation and for encouraging self-reliance. The longer-term aim must be in the improvement of traditional techniques together with the application of appropriate technology. Only in this way will the Yemeni tradition survive – by Derek Matthews</p><p><a href="http://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/3611/original/DPC0191.pdf?1384775752">http://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/3611/original/DPC0191.pdf?1384775752</a></p><p>Comment: In 1982 Yemen experienced an earthquake of 6.0 Richter scale magnitude with epicentre in Dhamar.

So what? Here: “Riyadh delegation” is the Saudi backed Hadi government delegation; the Saudis themselves do not take part in the peace talks. The Hadi side is speaking of “Saleh militia”, thus demanding them withdraw and surrender heavy weapons like they demand this from the Houthis. But there is no “Saleh militia”, actually this is the greater part of the Yemeni army which stayed loyal to ex-president Saleh. Thus, Qazali is right when saying that the Hadi government’s claims are absurd.

His latest book, <em>Who Rules the World?</em> I asked him to talk about Saudi Arabia’s role in the Middle East.</p><p>NOAM CHOMSKY<strong>:</strong> Well, there’s a long history. The basic—we don’t have a lot of time, but the basic story is that the United States, like Britain before it, has tended to support radical Islamism against secular nationalism. That’s been a consistent theme of imperial strategy for a long time. Saudi Arabia is the center of radical Islamic extremism. Patrick Cockburn, one of the best commentators and most knowledgeable commentators, has correctly pointed out that what he calls the Wahhibisation of Sunni Islam, the spread of Saudi extremist Wahhabi doctrine over Sunni Islam, the Sunni world, is one of the real disasters of modern—of the modern era. It’s a source of not only funding for extremist radical Islam and the jihadi outgrowths of it, but also, doctrinally, mosques, clerics and so on, schools, you know, madrassas, where you study just Qur’an, is spreading all over the huge Sunni areas from Saudi influence. And it continues.</p><p>Saudi Arabia itself has one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world. The ISIS beheadings, which shock everyone—I think Saudi Arabia is the only country where you have regular beheadings. That’s the least of it. Women have no—can’t drive, so on and so forth. And it is strongly backed by the United States and its allies, Britain and France. Reason? It’s got a lot of oil. It’s got a lot of money. You can sell them a lot of arms, I think tens of billions of dollars of arms. And the actions that it’s carrying out, for example, in Yemen, which you mentioned, are causing an immense humanitarian catastrophe in a pretty poor country, also stimulating jihadi terrorism, naturally, with U.S. and also British arms. French are trying to get into it, as well. This is a very ugly story.</p><p>Saudi Arabia—Saudi Arabia itself, its economy—its economy is based not only on a wasting resource, but a resource which is destroying the world. There’s reports now that it’s trying to take some steps to—much belated steps; should have been 50 years ago—to try to diversify the economy. It does have resources that are not destructive, like sunlight, for example, which could be used, and is, to an extent, being used for solar power. But it’s way too late and probably can’t be done. But it’s a—it has been a serious source of major global problems—a horrible society in itself, in many ways—and the U.S. and its allies, and Britain before it, have stimulated these radical Islamist developments throughout the—throughout the Islamic world for a long time.</p><p>AMY GOODMAN<strong>:</strong> Do you think Obama has dealt with Saudi Arabia any differently than President Bush before him?</p><p>NOAM CHOMSKY<strong>:</strong> Not in any way that I can see, no. Maybe in nuances.</p><p><a href="http://m.democracynow.org/stories/16217">http://m.democracynow.org/stories/16217</a></p><p>16.5.2016 – ABNA (* A K P)</p><p>Zaria Massacre: Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Nigerian President Buhari</p><p>If the Saudi regime agreed that “Houthis are Yemenis and are our neighbors with whom one can hold talks” then why not hold talks from the beginning? Why did the Saudi regime assembled a coalition to attack Yemen that included 10 Arab regimes and Senegal from Africa combined with massive supports from the US and UK? Why did the Saudi regime spent more than 100 billion Dollars for the aggression against Yemen if it knows that talks can solve disagreements? And why did the Saudi-led coalition killed close to 10,000 Yemeni civilians and destroyed the country’s infrastructures and historical sites if talks and negotiations from the beginning can resolve the disagreements?<br /> The right conclusion is that the Saudi regime assumed this new position due to its gross failure to realize its objectives through the war it imposed on Yemen, its present pathetic financial state and the growing discontent and dissent in Saudi Arabia. It is an open secret that the Saudi and its allied forces fought alongside AlQaeda and ISIS in Yemen against the brave and courageous Houthi freedom fighters but now they claimed they want to concentrate on the fight against Al-Qaeda and ISIS so as to give the US the pretext to station troops in Yemeni bases.<br /> Then we will try to compare this Saudi behaviour with their attitude on the brutal Zaria massacre in #Nigeria by the Nigerian army that killed close to 1000 defenseless and unarmed Shia Muslims that included 100s of women and children. The first person to call the Nigerian President Buhari after the inhuman slaughter in Zaria was the Saudi king Salman who congratulated Buhari for a job well done and called the massacre “part of war against terrorism”. Then the Nigerian regime launched a massive smear campaigns of calumny and demonization against the peaceful Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) under the leadership of His Eminence Sheikh Ibraheem #Zakzaky by desperately trying to link IMN with terrorism and making fraudulent claims that “IMN is more dangerous than #BokoHaram”!<br /> It has now become clear to all Nigerians that the brutal Zaria massacre was an evil imperialist agenda that has the Saudi regime as front and that was why Western governments and their media are silent about it. And the picture is now clearer that the massacre was pre-planned and that the assassination claims was just a gimmick to justify the inhuman slaughter of women, children and the aged – by H.

The FBI has another 80,000 classified documents, many of which deal with Saudi connections to the 9/11 terror plot. What’s the Bureau got?</p><p>In Florida, a federal judge is weighing whether to declassify portions of some 80,000 classified pages that could reveal far more about the hijackers’ Saudis connections and their activities in the weeks preceding the worst attack on U.S. soil.</p><p>The still-secret files speak to one of the strangest and most enduring mysteries of the 9/11 attacks. Why did the Saudi occupants of a posh house in gated community in Sarasota, Florida, suddenly vanish in the two weeks prior to the attacks? And had they been in touch with the leader of the operation, Mohamed Atta, and two of his co-conspirators?</p><p>No way, the FBI says, even though the bureau’s own agents did initially suspect the family was linked to some of the hijackers. On further scrutiny, those connections proved unfounded, officials now say.</p><p>But a team of lawyers and investigative journalists has found what they say is hard evidence pointing in the other direction.</p><p>The final answers about what really happened in Sarasota may lie somewhere in those 80,000 pages. To be sure, not all of them concern the FBI’s investigation of the Saudi family. The documents represent the entire case file of the 9/11 attacks at the Tampa field office. But some subset surely will reveal more about what the FBI knew, and when, and why it reached a different conclusion.</p><p>For the past two years, U.S. District Court Judge William Zloch has been going through the files, page by page, to determine what information that pertains to the Saudi case can be released.</p><p>As far as Christensen is concerned, the truth will out.

This is alarming given the CIA's secret drone war has killed hundreds of civilians and been described as a "failed strategy" by Obama's own former head of defense intelligence." – by Namir Shabibi</p><p><a href="https://news.vice.com/article/uk-could-face-murder-charges-over-covert-drone-strikes-say-mps">https://news.vice.com/article/uk-could-face-murder-charges-over-covert-drone-strikes-say-mps</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp13a Flüchtlinge / Refugees</strong></span></h2><p>17.5.2016 – Somaliland Informer (* B H)</p><p>Yemen: Malnutrition, Conflict worsens situation of Ogaden refugees</p><p>The Ogadeni refugees living in the Yemen’s capital, Sana’a and Al-Kharaz camp, about 120 kilometers of the Southern town of Aden are suffering and the conflict have aggravated the plight of at least 500 families, who were already facing acute food shortage and could not return to their homeland for fear of detention, torture and possibly persecution.</p><p>On Monday, more than a dozen of women from Ogaden region of Ethiopia gathered in front of the UNHCR’s Bureau for the Refugee Affairs (BRA) to raise their concerns with the UNHCR staff at the Algerian Street Sana’a. The UNHCR’s door is closed and nobody answers most of the cases, except few cases, like mandate renewal or receiving new clients, a process that takes up to two years.</p><p>The Ogadeni community in Sana’a numbers approximately 300- 500, of whom most of them registered with the UNHCR. Around 100 families from Ogaden live in Al-Kharaz Refugee in the South of Yemen, registered with the UN as refugees from Somalia.</p><p>Most of the refugees are women who have to bring up their families single-handed: their husbands are either in Ethiopian jails or have been killed by the government forces. They work as maidservants and are paid 150 dollars per month.</p><p>Scores of Ogaden asylum-holders took a risk in returning, however, their fear was justified: Upon their return to Ogaden region, they have been detained, tortured and charged in connection with ONLF-sympathizers for carrying UNHCR documents with them. They are serving four years term in the notorious prison better known as ‘Jail Ogaden’,in the regional capital of Jigjiga, about 80 kilometers Eastern of the city of Harar, in which torture and execution are routine.</p><p>The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Sana’a, Yemen has already ignored their plight and they receive less attention from the International Community and UNHCR’s donors.</p><p>Moreover, the local UNHCR’s cruel treatment of the African Refugees and asylum seekers is horrible and shameful.The refugees are treated as they are criminals and the security guards behave as prison guards.The guards, who receive orders from the UNHCR’s</p><p>local staff whose their backgrounds are half-caste Ethiopian-Yemenis and Somali Yemenis, often beat women with their batons, intimidate and harass the young African men in front of their loved ones.</p><p>Most refugees felt helpless after their former leader Yusuf Goggaar and his wife allegedly executed by poison. Another Somali Christian father likely died of poisoning. He left behind a son of his and his bible.The gangsters that are eliminating the voice of the voiceless refugees remain unknown to the wider Yemeni community and the rest of the World.</p><p>According to refugees, there is no any independent body overseeing what the UNHCR Yemen do on the ground level. And no private human rights organizations that could put pressure on UN to do the right things.</p><p><a href="http://www.somalilandinformer.com/africa/yemen-malnutrition-conflict-worsens-situation-of-ogaden-refugees/">http://www.somalilandinformer.com/africa/yemen-malnutrition-conflict-worsens-situation-of-ogaden-refugees/</a> see also older article from Oct. 2015: <a href="http://www.mareeg.com/unhcrs-deviant-behavior-in-yemen-will-donors-put-pressure-on-un-to-do-the-right-thing/">http://www.mareeg.com/unhcrs-deviant-behavior-in-yemen-will-donors-put-pressure-on-un-to-do-the-right-thing/</a></p><p>16.5.2016 – UN High Commissioner for Refugees (B H)</p><p>2016 Yemen Situation Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan: Funding snapshot as at 12 May 2016</p><p><a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/2016-yemen-situation-regional-refugee-and-migrant-response-plan-funding-snapshot-12-may">http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/2016-yemen-situation-regional-refugee-and-migrant-response-plan-funding-snapshot-12-may</a></p><p>13.5.2016 – Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat (** B H)</p><p>Shifting Tides: The changing nature of mixed migration crossings to Yemen</p><p>By early April 2016, there were more than <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/task_force_on_population_movement_8th_report_-_apr_2016.pdf">2.7 million internally displaced persons</a> (10% of the Yemeni population), and more than <a href="http://data.unhcr.org/yemen/regional.php">175,000 had sought refuge in neighbouring countries in the region</a>, some 85,000 of whom had fled to countries in the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan).</p><p>Yemen’s geographical position on the south-western tip of the Arabian Peninsula has long positioned the country as a gateway for the movement of people and goods from the Horn of Africa. Migrants, asylum seekers and refugees (primarily of Ethiopian and Somali origin) have traditionally travelled from the coastal towns of Obock in Djibouti and Bossaso in Puntland, Somalia across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden/Arabian Sea to Yemen. Monitoring patrol teams established by UNHCR and partners (Danish Refugee Council, Yemen Red Crescent Society, and the Society of Human Solidarity) have patrolled the coastal roads of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea since 2006, providing information on the numbers of people arriving on Yemeni shores.</p><p>With the exception of 2010 (as the result of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/23/saudi-arabia-yemen-houthi-war">a war along the Yemen-Saudi border</a> and a Yemeni security force clamp down on the arrival of Somali nationals) and 2013 (<a href="http://www.regionalmms.org/fileadmin/content/rmms_publications/RMMS_Letter_of_the_Law_-_Saudi_Arabia_report.pdf">following the mass expulsion of migrant workers from Saudi Arabia</a>), the numbers reveal a year-on-year increase of the arrival of migrants and refugees in Yemen.</p><p>The 2015 Yemen conflict, which triggered a new bi-directional flow along the strait with the arrival of persons from Yemen back into the Horn, appears to have done little to deter groups of migrants and refugees from continuing to cross into Yemen. In fact, Yemen arrival figures in 2015 were the highest recorded since 2012, and the third highest since monitoring began. Due to the disruption of monitoring missions caused by the conflict in 2015, it is possible that the arrivals figures in 2015 were even much higher.</p><p>A more detailed look at the figures in 2015 shows a steady climb in arrival figures in the first three months of the year, followed by a sharp drop in April and May, coinciding with the outbreak of conflict at the end of March. In June however, as outward flows from Yemen began to decline, arrival figures began to climb again, with a peak in October, the highest monthly arrival figure ever recorded since 2006. These statistics not only show an increasing demand for travel to Yemen despite the risks associated with a conflict zone, it also shows that migrants and refugees may perceive the unrest to facilitate a better environment for undetected passage. It also alludes to the ability of smuggling networks to quickly regroup and reorganise their business model in such situations.</p><p>Migrants and refugees travelling to Yemen from the Horn of Africa face various protection risks that are<a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/05/25/yemens-torture-camps/abuse-migrants-human-traffickers-climate-impunity">widely documented</a>. These risks are faced at all steps of the journey – at origin, while in transit on land, during the sea journey, and on arrival in Yemen. RMMS’ reports <a href="http://www.regionalmms.org/fileadmin/content/featured%20articles/RMMSbooklet.pdf">Desperate Choices, </a><a href="http://www.regionalmms.org/fileadmin/content/rmms_publications/Blinded_by_Hope.pdf">Blinded by Hope, </a>and<a href="http://www.regionalmms.org/fileadmin/content/rmms_publications/Blinded_by_Hope.pdf">Abused and Abducted</a> have observed the risks faced by people on the move including, physical and sexual violence, abduction and kidnapping, extortion, and torture. In <em>Blinded by Hope</em> 70 percent of interviewed Ethiopian migrants that had returned from Yemen had either witnessed or experienced ‘extreme physical abuse, including burning, gunshot wounds and suspension of food for days’.</p><p>Data received from the monitoring missions show that these abuses are more pronounced along the Red Sea route from Obock, Djibouti, and in particular kidnap for ransom. No cases of abduction have ever been reported along the Arabian Sea route. According to UNHCR, patrols along the Arabian Sea are manned by UNHCR’s partner Society of Human Solidarity, who the capacity to receive all new arrivals on the shore regardless of the time preventing smugglers and criminal networks an opportunity to carry out abductions.</p><p>The smuggler networks between the point of embarkation in Obock and disembarkation in Yemen were extremely coordinated in sharing information on when boats would set off and arrive. Once migrants/refugees landed in Yemen, they would be abducted and taken to smuggling dens for weeks on end, until they paid extortion fees to secure their release. If they were unable to pay they would be physically beaten, raped, tortured or put to work before eventually being released. Oftentimes migrants travelling further north after their release would be recaptured by other smugglers and go through a similar process.</p><p>The threat of abduction and kidnapping for ransom remains a significant threat for those moving, and particularly Ethiopian nationals who are perceived to be able to pay ransoms more readily than their Somali counterparts.</p><p>RMMS monthly summaries continue to include reports on the abduction of migrants/refugees arriving via the Red Sea coasts. In March 2016, <a href="http://regionalmms.org/fileadmin/content/monthly%20summaries/RMMSMonthlySummaryMarch%202016.pdf">migrants reported 218 cases of abduction and 29 cases of trafficking</a>, amounting to 77 percent and 10 percent respectively of all protection incidents reported in that month.</p><p>Nonetheless, migrants and refugees continue to land along the Red Sea coast. More than 4,600 people have plied this route between January and March 2016. For Ethiopian migrants (who now account for 85 percent of people moving to Yemen) the Red Sea route is quicker, and cheaper, which may explain why so many still choose to use that passage. But even that route from Djibouti may become more difficult and more expensive. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Djiboutian government has instituted a crackdown on Ethiopian migrants, prompting them to move into Somalia and depart from Bossaso.</p><p>Despite the recent shifts in the mixed migration flows to Yemen we can continue to expect that migrants and refugees, and especially Ethiopian nationals, will continue to cross from the Horn of Africa to Yemen.</p><p><a href="http://www.regionalmms.org/indexEthiopian.html">http://www.regionalmms.org/indexEthiopian.html</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp13b Nationalbank und Währung / National Bank and currency</strong></span></h2><p><strong>15.5.2016 – Al Monitor (** A E P)</strong></p><p><strong>Beware of the failure of Yemen’s central bank</strong></p><p>The Central Bank of Yemen continues to set new policies to tackle the rising inflation and devaluation of the Yemeni rial, knowing its policies will not be effective as long as there is no political will to stabilize the situation.</p><p>One of the last standing public institutions in Yemen is its central bank. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) has been playing a major role in stabilizing the very fragile <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2013/CAR073013A.htm">economic situation</a> in Yemen since the outbreak of the uprising in 2011. It has maintained a very careful monetary policy in order to preserve the value of the Yemeni rial to spare the people of Yemen the agony of hyperinflation and devaluation during politically volatile times.</p><p>The trust in the CBY took a blow in March 2015 when the government along with the president had to flee the country, leaving financial matters to be run by the governor of the CBY.</p><p>The technocratic and bipartisan leadership governing the CBY is what enabled its survival. The CBY governor, Mohammed Awad Bin Hammam, is a widely respected official in a country where bipartisanship seems almost impossible. His administration banned cashing foreign transfers in their original currency for a few months in 2015 to stop the dollar drain after trade significantly slowed down when the Saudi-led coalition's airstrikes started.</p><p>This was a mechanism to curb devaluation of the Yemeni rial and substitute the inflow of foreign currency the country was supposed to earn from its oil exports, which were halted in March 2015. The CBY only lowered the value of the rial against the US dollar earlier this year by 17% — from 214 to 250 Yemeni rials to the dollar — to mitigate a bigger devaluation of the currency in the black market that was exchanging the dollar for <a href="http://www.almasdaronline.com/article/81463">279 rials</a>, 11.6% lower than the official exchange rate of 250. This is a signal by the CBY for the market to show it is recognizing the problem of the scarcity of hard currencies and is willing to adapt in order to regain the trust of the market.</p><p>While the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/yemen-economy-idUSL5N0VT38020150220">foreign reserves</a> of the CBY went down from $5.35 billion in 2013 to $4.6 billion in November 2014, the war and the cutting of sources of foreign currency — except for the remittances from Yemenis abroad — contributed in lowering the foreign reserves to $2.1 billion by the end of 2015, <a href="http://eosc-yemen.org/images/DownloadCenteR/OtheR/3rdSocio-EconomicUpdatE/USEU-13th_Ar.pdf">according to a report</a> by Yemen's Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation.</p><p>Although some might want to blame the depletion of foreign reserves entirely on the Houthi rebel group, which is in fact <a href="http://www.almasdaronline.com/article/81433">withdrawing substantial amounts of money</a> from the CBY to finance its war efforts, the reason behind the dwindling foreign reserves is primarily the ever-rising demand for foreign currency in the country.</p><p>The depletion of the CBY foreign reserves limits the range of anti-inflationary monetary policies the CBY can implement to stop a free fall of the value of the Yemeni rial. This limitation <a href="http://almasdaronline.com/article/80781">led the Houthis to arrest </a>many owners of currency exchange shops who did not abide by the CBY’s official exchange rate. If the CBY cannot stabilize the value of the Yemeni rial, more capital will leave the country for more stable economies, prices of basic commodities will go up beyond the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/yemen/publication/economic-outlook-spring-2016">30% inflation rate</a> the country witnessed in 2015, real wages and purchasing power will decline even if nominal wages were raised and the gap between the poor and rich, who own assets in foreign currencies, will drastically widen.</p><p>Even if the CBY continues to set new policies to tackle rising inflation and the devaluation of the Yemeni rial, its policies will not be effective as long as there is no political will to stabilize the situation. This puts a huge responsibility on the conflicting parties to come up with a sustainable political solution to spare the Yemeni people further misery and deterioration in the standard of living.

Unlike military counterparts that operate in larger units, police officers man isolated checkpoints and have constant interaction with the populations they are trying to protect. Both the mission and symbolism of police make officers prime targets for any terrorist group, from the <a href="http://soufangroup.com/tsg-intelbrief-the-next-chapter-of-the-afghan-war/">Taliban</a> to <a href="http://soufangroup.com/tsg-intelbrief-driving-back-al-qaeda-in-yemen/">al-Qaeda</a> to the <a href="http://soufangroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/TSG-The-Islamic-State-Nov14.pdf">so-called Islamic State</a>. A population that feels protected and secure can build resilience to extremism. A police officer standing on a street corner provides a symbol of stability and governance, both of which terrorists cannot abide.</p><p>A fundamental principle of counterinsurgency strategy is the protection of the local population. Achieving that goal requires guaranteeing the protection of the protectors. Yet the vital mission of police officers requires close interaction with the community; the overwhelming scale of violence and conflict that officers face in places like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Iraq puts them at a level of risk that is difficult to effectively negate or minimize. Given the primacy of their mission, more effort will be needed to protect those who have stood up and volunteered to serve and protect.</p><p><a href="http://soufangroup.com/tsg-intelbrief-police-on-the-frontlines-of-terror/">http://soufangroup.com/tsg-intelbrief-police-on-the-frontlines-of-terror/</a></p><p>Comment by Judith Brown: The daily risks of police in destabilised countries.

One of the pressuring elements, making the resolution’s implementation crucial is the economic precarious status which is on the verge of collapse. Insurgent militias have taken over state authority, he explained.</p><p>Following is a set of questions answered by Yemeni Minister of Tourism Eryany:</p><p>How do you read into the insurgency’s evasiveness at the negotiations?</p><p>I can assure you that the Yemeni government had went to negotiations in Kuwait with earnest intentions on negotiating and absolute desire for achieving peace.</p><p>We speak on behalf of the government which is responsible for all Yemeni citizens, regardless of their political, sectarian or ideological affiliations. However, we realize that a number of regional parties do not wish peace, security or stability for Yemen. They wish for Yemen to continue being the chink in the Arabian Gulf’s armor.</p><p>International resolutions are clear cut; U.N. resolution 2216 especially revolves around stages that lead to restoring statehood. The implementation of resolution 2216 means the restoration of sovereignty and integrity for Yemeni citizens and dodges the chaos Yemen could enter.</p><p>How do you read into the northern-southern discord, and the Zaidiyyah- Shafi’i sectarian strife recently appearing in Yemen, in light of regional players feeding into that?</p><p>No sign on Sunni-Zaidi conflict have appeared since hundreds of year. Everyone coexisted with no apparent disputes.</p><p>Houthis have made a huge mistake by getting on Iran’s side.

And we - there is no intention to have those casualties in Yemen if it happens because Yemen is our neighbor. We have family in both sides of the borders. We have very deep relationships.</p><p>KELLY: The United Nations also says that while there have been war crimes committed by multiple parties in this conflict that the majority of civilian deaths have come from airstrikes carried out by the Saudi-led coalition.</p><p>ASIRI: If you allow me, we - the kingdom in particular and the 12 countries who came to Yemen to secure human the Yemeni doesn't have...</p><p>KELLY: You're talking about your coalition partners, mostly other Arab nations.</p><p>ASIRI: ...Doesn't have any ambition in Yemen. Why we go to Yemen? Why we lose our resources? Why we lose our boys? Why we lose our equipment? Is it because we want to have influence in Yemen or to occupy the Yemeni country? No because we saw population undermined and oppressed by the militias. This is why.</p><p>KELLY: We interviewed on this program last month an official from Human Rights Watch. She described an airstrike on a village in rural Yemen that killed 97 people. Human Rights Watch sent a team. They examined the site. They concluded that this was an indiscriminate strike carried out by Saudi Arabia.</p><p>ASIRI: Unfortunately, today, there is no team from Human Rights Watch on the ground.</p><p>KELLY: They went. They saw it.</p><p>ASIRI: No. No one can get in Yemen without the permission of the coalition. So we don't have single permission from the United Nations on the ground.</p><p>We hope that Human Rights Watch and the other NGOs come to the coalition and ask permission and we will send them down to investigate. We need to investigate those allegations. You cannot...</p><p>KELLY: I think you and Human Rights Watch are going to agree to disagree. My question is whether the Saudi intervention has improved things. The country remains in chaos after more than a year of fighting. Are you any closer to your goals or bringing stability to the country?</p><p>ASIRI: I think this is not precise, saying this. Today, what is the result? At that time, the militias doesn't want to talk peacefully with the government. Today, they are talking.</p><p>KELLY: You're talking about these peace talks...</p><p>ASIRI: Yes, peace talks underway in Kuwait.</p><p>Continue reading at:</p><p><a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/05/16/478188314/saudi-arabia-regrets-civilian-casualties-during-operations-in-yemen">http://www.npr.org/2016/05/16/478188314/saudi-arabia-regrets-civilian-casualties-during-operations-in-yemen</a></p><p>See HRW’s reply and Daniel Larison’s comment in cp 1 Most important.</p><p>Comment by Kenneth Roth, <span>Executive Director, Human Rights: Saudis can't defend killing Yemeni civilians so pretend <a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/hrw">@HRW</a> wasn't there to investigate.</span></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/KenRoth/status/732311514170949633/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">https://twitter.com/KenRoth/status/732311514170949633/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a></p><p>Comment: How can they “regret” civilian casualties when having deliberately targeted at civilians?

They played an important role in building bridges in the capital, Sanaa. Although they did nothing to deserve accusations of treason or imprisonment, the authorities started harassing them in 2008 as four Baha’is were arrested. Following their release, most of them left Yemen according to Hamed’s wife who decided to go public with her story.</p><p>Her husband had been imprisoned for three years when the defence in the case went as far as to request the death penalty. Elham decided to be silent no more and to talk to the media. “About 1,000 Bahai’s – or even more – live in Yemen. My husband and I are Yemeni nationals,” she said. “Dr Kamal, my father-in-law, came to the island of Socotra in southern Yemen as the private physician of Socotra’s Sultan Issa ibn Ali ibn Afrar. The Sultan decided to reward him for his loyalty by granting him the Yemeni nationality. The family settled in Socotra until the Communist regime took over in southern Yemen, hence the decision to leave for the United Arab Emirates.”</p><p>In 1990, she went on, “Hamed, Dr Kamal’s son, decided to go back and work in Yemen. We lived there safely all those years until the harassment started in 2008. The Baha’is were accused of being Israeli spies because our holy Baha’i shrine and the Seat of the Universal House of Justice, i.e. our Baha’i leadership, are located in Occupied Palestine. Our presence in Palestine goes way back, many years before the creation of the State of Israel… we cannot be spies because our religion bans us from undertaking any political activity.”</p><p>Elham later learned that her husband had been arrested by National Security who nonetheless denied that they were detaining him. She would go there with his medication as he suffered from diabetes, cholesterol, high blood pressure and kidney stones. The officers would take the medication, telling her they did not know whether or not her husband was there. Afterward, he was taken to the central prison, where he was allowed to communicate with his wife and sons.</p><p>Hamed went through extensive torture in jail, not to mention the insults levelled at his wife when she visited him. “My husband is an engineer in Balhaf, which – as you know – is an uninhabited region. So what is there to spy on? What proof is there of his spying? All they found is our religious books. I don’t know what gave them the right to inflict this injustice upon my husband and throw him in the same cell with terrorists.” – by Hind Al Eryani</p><p><a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/baha-yemen-1469024072">http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/baha-yemen-1469024072</a></p><p>15.5.2016 – UNFPA (B H)</p><p>Population Development</p><p>Within a span of 35 years, between 1975 and 2010, Yemen’s population increased from 6 to 23 million. At the present growth rate of 3%, one of the highest in the world, Yemen’s population would reach 34 million by 2025. The issue of population growth is one of the most important challenges facing the country today.</p><p>Rapid population growth slows down Yemen’s development in many ways. It increases the pressure on the limited area of arable land and scarce water resources to produce food, making it harder to improve food security and combat malnutrition. The population is young, with 45% under the age of 15, resulting in a rapid rise in the school age population and demand for education. Demand for other public services including health care and social protection services is creating similar pressure, with growing rate of unemployment.</p><p>Population growth is related to a number of factors. Early marriage, limited girls education, high female illiteracy, high adolescent fertility rate and the low use of contraceptives, all contribute to the relatively high total fertility rate (TFR) (6.2 births per woman). The unmet need for family planning is high (37%), and cultural taboos and misconceptions impede access to existing services.</p><p>UNFPA supports the government with data collection for policy, planning and programming. Improvements in data availability and analysis will result in improved decision-making, policy formulation and resource allocation around population dynamics, sexual and reproductive health, and gender equality.</p><p>UNFPA provides technical and financial support for the implementation of the Demographic Health Survey (DHS and the 2014 Census.</p><p><a href="http://yemen.unfpa.org/topics/population-development">http://yemen.unfpa.org/topics/population-development</a></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vorige / Previous: </strong></span></p><p><a href="/autoren/dklose/krieg-im-jemen-neue-artikel-zum-nachlesen-144">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose/krieg-im-jemen-neue-artikel-zum-nachlesen-144</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Neue Artikel zum Nachlesen 1-144: / Yemen Press Reader 1-144:</strong></span></h2><p><a href="/autoren/dklose">https://www.freitag.de/autoren/dklose</a> oder / or</p><p><a href="http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm">http://poorworld.net/YemenWar.htm</a></p></div>
