I’m particularly pleased that</em> TomDispatch <em>is excerpting the book's final, monumental essay, “Masters of Mankind,” as a two-parter.</em></p><p><strong>American Power Under Challenge</strong> <br /><strong>Masters of Mankind (Part 1)</strong></p><p>We cannot gain a realistic understanding of who rules the world while ignoring the “masters of mankind,” as Adam Smith called them: in his day, the merchants and manufacturers of England; in ours, multinational conglomerates, huge financial institutions, retail empires, and the like. Still following Smith, it is also wise to attend to the “vile maxim” to which the “masters of mankind” are dedicated: “All for ourselves and nothing for other people” -- a doctrine known otherwise as bitter and incessant class war, often one-sided, much to the detriment of the people of the home country and the world.</p><p>In the contemporary global order, the institutions of the masters hold enormous power, not only in the international arena but also within their home states, on which they rely to protect their power and to provide economic support by a wide variety of means. When we consider the role of the masters of mankind, we turn to such state policy priorities of the moment as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the investor-rights agreements mislabeled “free-trade agreements” in propaganda and commentary.</p><p><strong>The Second Superpower</strong></p><p>The neoliberal programs of the past generation have concentrated wealth and power in far fewer hands while undermining functioning democracy, but they have aroused opposition as well</p><p>The rising opposition to the neoliberal assault highlights another crucial aspect of the standard convention: it sets aside the public, which often fails to accept the approved role of “spectators” (rather than “participants”) assigned to it in liberal democratic theory.</p><p>There is far more to say, of course, about the factors in determining state policy that are put to the side when we adopt the standard convention that states are the actors in international affairs. But with such nontrivial caveats as these, let us nevertheless adopt the convention, at least as a first approximation to reality. Then the question of who rules the world leads at once to such concerns as China’s rise to power and its challenge to the United States and “world order,” the new cold war simmering in eastern Europe, the Global War on Terror, American hegemony and American decline, and a range of similar considerations.</p><p><strong>Western Power Under Pressure</strong></p><p>There is far more to say, of course, about the factors in determining state policy that are put to the side when we adopt the standard convention that states are the actors in international affairs. But with such nontrivial caveats as these, let us nevertheless adopt the convention, at least as a first approximation to reality. Then the question of who rules the world leads at once to such concerns as China’s rise to power and its challenge to the United States and “world order,” the new cold war simmering in eastern Europe, the Global War on Terror, American hegemony and American decline, and a range of similar considerations.</p><p><strong>The Challenges Today: East Asia</strong></p><p><strong>The Challenges Today: Eastern Europe</strong></p><p><strong>The Challenges Today: The Islamic World</strong></p><p>Let us turn to the third region of major concern, the (largely) Islamic world, also the scene of the Global War on Terror (GWOT) that George W. Bush declared in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attack. To be more accurate, <em>re-</em>declared. The GWOT was declared by the Reagan administration when it took office, with fevered rhetoric about a “plague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself” (as Reagan put it) and a “return to barbarism in the modern age” (the words of George Shultz, his secretary of state). The original GWOT has been quietly removed from history. It very quickly turned into a murderous and destructive terrorist war afflicting Central America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, with grim repercussions to the present, even leading to condemnation of the United States by the World Court (which Washington dismissed). In any event, it is not the right story for history, so it is gone.</p><p>The success of the Bush-Obama version of GWOT can readily be evaluated on direct inspection. When the war was declared, the terrorist targets were confined to a small corner of tribal Afghanistan. They were protected by Afghans, who mostly disliked or despised them, under the tribal code of hospitality -- which baffled Americans when poor peasants refused “to turn over Osama bin Laden for the, to them, astronomical sum of $25 million.”</p><p>There are good reasons to believe that a well-constructed police action, or even serious diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban, might have placed those suspected of the 9/11 crimes in American hands for trial and sentencing. But such options were off the table. Instead, the reflexive choice was large-scale violence -- not with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban (that came later) but to make clear U.S. contempt for tentative Taliban offers of the possible extradition of bin Laden. How serious these offers were we do not know, since the possibility of exploring them was never entertained. Or perhaps the United States was just intent on “trying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don’t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose.”</p><p>That was the judgment of the highly respected anti-Taliban leader Abdul Haq, one of the many oppositionists who condemned the American bombing campaign launched in October 2001 as "a big setback" for their efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within, a goal they considered within their reach. His judgment is confirmed by Richard A. Clarke, who was chairman of the Counterterrorism Security Group at the White House under President George W. Bush when the plans to attack Afghanistan were made. As Clarke describes the meeting, when informed that the attack would violate international law, "the President yelled in the narrow conference room, ‘I don’t care what the international lawyers say, we are going to kick some ass.'" The attack was also bitterly opposed by the major aid organizations working in Afghanistan, who warned that millions were on the verge of starvation and that the consequences might be horrendous.</p><p>The consequences for poor Afghanistan years later need hardly be reviewed.</p><p>The next target of the sledgehammer was Iraq. The U.S.-UK invasion, utterly without credible pretext, is the major crime of the twenty-first century. The invasion led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people in a country where the civilian society had already been devastated by American and British sanctions that were regarded as “genocidal” by the two distinguished international diplomats who administered them, and resigned in protest for this reason. The invasion also generated millions of refugees, largely destroyed the country, and instigated a sectarian conflict that is now tearing apart Iraq and the entire region. It is an astonishing fact about our intellectual and moral culture that in informed and enlightened circles it can be called, blandly, “the liberation of Iraq.”</p><p>Pentagon and British Ministry of Defense polls found that only 3% of Iraqis regarded the U.S. security role in their neighborhood as legitimate, less than 1% believed that “coalition” (U.S.-UK) forces were good for their security, 80% opposed the presence of coalition forces in the country, and a majority supported attacks on coalition troops. Afghanistan has been destroyed beyond the possibility of reliable polling, but there are indications that something similar may be true there as well. Particularly in Iraq the United States suffered a severe defeat, abandoning its official war aims, and leaving the country under the influence of the sole victor, Iran.</p><p>The sledgehammer was also wielded elsewhere, notably in Libya, where the three traditional imperial powers (Britain, France, and the United States) procured Security Council resolution 1973 and instantly violated it, becoming the air force of the rebels. The effect was to undercut the possibility of a peaceful, negotiated settlement; sharply increase casualties (by at least a factor of 10, according to political scientist Alan Kuperman); leave Libya in ruins, in the hands of warring militias; and, more recently, to provide the Islamic State with a base that it can use to spread terror beyond. Quite sensible diplomatic proposals by the African Union, accepted in principle by Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi, were ignored by the imperial triumvirate, as Africa specialist Alex de Waal reviews. A huge flow of weapons and jihadis has spread terror and violence from West Africa (now the champion for terrorist murders) to the Levant, while the NATO attack also sent a flood of refugees from Africa to Europe.</p><p>Yet another triumph of “humanitarian intervention,” and, as the long and often ghastly record reveals, not an unusual one, going back to its modern origins four centuries ago – by Noam Chomsky</p><p><a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176137/">http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176137/</a></p><p><strong>10.5.2016 – Tom Dispatch (*** B K P T)</strong></p><p><strong>Masters of Mankind: the Costs of Violence</strong></p><p>[<em>This piece, the second of two parts, is excerpted from Noam Chomsky’s new book, </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/162779381X/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">Who Rules the World?</a> <em>(Metropolitan Books). Part 1 can be found by </em><em><a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176137/">clicking here</a></em><em>.</em>]</p><p>In brief, the Global War on Terror sledgehammer strategy has spread jihadi terror from a tiny corner of Afghanistan to much of the world, from Africa through the Levant and South Asia to Southeast Asia. It has also incited attacks in Europe and the United States. The invasion of Iraq made a substantial contribution to this process, much as intelligence agencies had predicted. Terrorism specialists Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank estimate that the Iraq War “generated a stunning sevenfold increase in the yearly rate of fatal jihadist attacks, amounting to literally hundreds of additional terrorist attacks and thousands of civilian lives lost; even when terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan is excluded, fatal attacks in the rest of the world have increased by more than one-third.” Other exercises have been similarly productive.</p><p>More generally, studies carried out by the Oslo Peace Research Institute show that two-thirds of the region’s conflict fatalities were produced in originally internal disputes where outsiders imposed their solutions. In such conflicts, 98% of fatalities were produced only after outsiders had entered the domestic dispute with their military might.</p><p>The evidence reviewed by political scientist Timo Kivimäki indicates that the “protection wars [fought by ‘coalitions of the willing’] have become the main source of violence in the world, occasionally contributing over 50% of total conflict fatalities.” Furthermore, in many of these cases, including Syria, as he reviews, there were opportunities for diplomatic settlement that were ignored. That has also been true in other horrific situations, including the Balkans in the early 1990s, the first Gulf War, and of course the Indochina wars, the worst crime since World War II. In the case of Iraq the question does not even arise. There surely are some lessons here.</p><p>The general consequences of resorting to the sledgehammer against vulnerable societies comes as little surprise. William Polk’s careful study of insurgencies, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061236209/counterpunchmaga">Violent Politics</a></em>, should be essential reading for those who want to understand today’s conflicts.</p><p>Polk reveals a pattern that has been replicated over and over. The invaders — perhaps professing the most benign motives — are naturally disliked by the population, who disobey them, at first in small ways, eliciting a forceful response, which increases opposition and support for resistance. The cycle of violence escalates until the invaders withdraw — or gain their ends by something that may approach genocide.</p><p>Obama’s global drone assassination campaign, a remarkable innovation in global terrorism, exhibits the same patterns. By most accounts, it is generating terrorists more rapidly than it is murdering those suspected of someday intending to harm us.</p><p>Another characteristic feature of such interventions is the belief that the insurgency will be overcome by eliminating its leaders. But when such an effort succeeds, the reviled leader is regularly replaced by someone younger, more determined, more brutal, and more effective.</p><p>Careful studies of al-Qaeda and ISIS have shown that the United States and its allies are following their game plan with some precision. Their goal is to “draw the West as deeply and actively as possible into the quagmire” and “to perpetually engage and enervate the United States and the West in a series of prolonged overseas ventures” in which they will undermine their own societies, expend their resources, and increase the level of violence, setting off the dynamic that Polk reviews.</p><p>And if we continue to wield the sledgehammer, tacitly following the jihadi script, the likely effect is even more violent jihadism with broader appeal. The record, Atran advises, “should inspire a radical change in our counter-strategies.”</p><p>Repeated Western interventions since then in the Middle East and Africa have exacerbated the tensions, conflicts, and disruptions that have shattered the societies. The end result is a “refugee crisis” that the innocent West can scarcely endure.</p><p>Returning to the opening question “Who rules the world?” we might also want to pose another question: “What principles and values rule the world?” That question should be foremost in the minds of the citizens of the rich and powerful states, who enjoy an unusual legacy of freedom, privilege, and opportunity thanks to the struggles of those who came before them, and who now face fateful choices as to how to respond to challenges of great human import – by Noam Chomsky</p><p><a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176138/tomgram%3A_noam_chomsky%2C_what_principles_rule_the_world">http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176138/tomgram%3A_noam_chomsky%2C_what_principles_rule_the_world</a> = <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/05/10/masters-of-mankind-the-costs-of-violence/">http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/05/10/masters-of-mankind-the-costs-of-violence/</a></p><p>This is like a comment to this article: US lies for war - from Vietnam to Syria. With assistance from the media and compliant NGOs - the programme for US regime change has been couched in euphemistic phrases like 'Humanitarian intervention' and 'R2P - Responsibility to Protect' using equally euphemistic terms such as 'No fly zone' or 'Safe Zone', the former entailing the destruction of the target nation's airforce bases, giving the 'Humanitarian interventionists' supremacy in the skies to bomb at will, while the latter provides zones where proxy forces funded, armed and trained by the US and its allies in NATO and the Gulf Petromonachy states can hide among civilian refugees out of reach of the military forces of the targetted nation. We have to wise up to lies before more countries are devastated and their populations murdered by way of soundbites for imperialism.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Classy.Yemeni/posts/827555107374672">https://www.facebook.com/Classy.Yemeni/posts/827555107374672</a></p><p><strong>11.5.2016 – RT (** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>‘Yemen instability represents failed US policy throughout region’</strong></p><p>Despite the Pentagon’s claims that the deployment of US forces in Yemen has to do with fighting Al-Qaeda, their main objectives there are to prevent and contain the influence of Iran, said Abayomi Azikiwe, editor at Pan-African News Wire.</p><p>The US sends so-called advisers to Yemen. Pentagon officials claim that the move is aimed at tackling Al-Qaeda, which has been quietly gaining strength there.</p><p>RT: Washington is again avoiding the term “boots on the ground,” and now goes for “advisers” and “limited support.” Why is that?</p><p>Abayomi Azikiwe: There has been this denial in regard to escalating a military intervention by the Pentagon in various Middle Eastern states due in large part to the disasters over the last 25 years. We can look at Iraq, we can look at Afghanistan, we can look at the situation in Libya and also the situation in Syria, and of course in Yemen. The US some 14 months ago withdrew special forces; they evacuated their embassy in Yemen. That signaled the Saudi and Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] coalition to begin a bombing campaign, which has continued for over the last 14 months not against Al-Qaeda and other Islamist extremist organizations, but against the [Jund] Ansar Allah. The Houthi movement… is in alliance with Islamic Republic of Iran – their objective is to stop the Houthi movement across Yemen. If you look at the alliances that were formed against the advances of the Houthi, [they] have nothing to do with the fight against Al-Qaeda. In fact, Al-Qaeda- linked organizations in Yemen were allying with the Saudi GCC forces – and that has been the case now since last year.</p><p><strong>RT: </strong><em>The State Department confirmed that the rise of Al-Qaeda in Yemen is being caused by the chaos on the ground. But what contributed to this instability in the first place?</em></p><p><strong>AA:</strong> It’s been a failed US policy in Yemen. It’s been several years that they have been carrying out this so-called targeted associations against Al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula. But mostly people who have been killed were not the Al-Qaeda operatives – many of them were innocent civilians, or people who could not be directly linked to Al-Qaeda. What we have in Yemen is a representation of a failed US policy throughout the region. It’s absurd for Peter Cook, the spokesperson for the Pentagon, to even suggest that this redeployment of US forces has anything to do with fighting Al-Qaeda. Their main objectives there are to prevent and contain the influence of Iran. This ties in with their foreign policy in Syria, where they’ve backed these extremist organizations which have caused tremendous death and destruction in Syria, and of course they are reentering Iraq. They have deployed additional troops to Syria. As well, they are jockeying for another deployment into Libya in North Africa. So this is a representation of the same policy that emanates from successive US administrations – both Democratic, as well as Republican.</p><p><strong>RT: </strong><em>The news about sending the military into Yemen quietly emerged on Friday evening. The decision was taken without public debate or the approval of Congress. What do you think about the timing and the way the decision was taken?</em></p><p><strong>AA:</strong> These are the tactics that are utilized now. They don’t want this in the public view. It could prompt debate among newspaper, editorial boards, among public, intellectuals, independent media personnel. So these are the people they do not want to inform about the actual policies in Yemen.</p><p>At the same time there is an election here in the US. Most of the corporate media and the government-controlled media are covering what is going on with Donald Trump, with Hillary Clinton. That is a diversion from the actual foreign policy that is taking place. And foreign policy hasn’t been a major point of discussion in the debates or in the overall campaign over the last several months.</p><p><strong>RT: </strong><em>The UN has described what's going on in Yemen as a 'humanitarian catastrophe' as a result of the Saudi-coalition air campaign there. How do you assess the fact that America actively supports the Saudis’ bombardments of Yemenis, while at the same time tries to support Yemen in fighting Al-Qaeda?</em></p><p><strong>AA:</strong> Well, I don’t believe they are supporting the Yemenis against Al-Qaeda, because Al-Qaeda has been supported by Saudi Arabia and its allies. The US is providing intelligence to the Saudi GCC coalition, which has been bombing Yemen for the last 14 months, resulting in the deaths of at least 10,000 people, the displacement of two million people inside the country... And they are also providing refilling technology to the GCC air campaign, which is utilizing US-made F-16 fighter jets and other forms of Arab bombardment technology against the people of Yemen. These are the people on the ground who’re being targeted by this US-backed and coordinated coalition, and that is the real struggle as far as US imperialism is concerned in Yemen.</p><p><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-edge/342676-terrorists-yemen-us-war-troops/">https://www.rt.com/op-edge/342676-terrorists-yemen-us-war-troops/</a></p><p><strong>12.5.2016 – Arabian Rights Watch (** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>USE OF FOREIGN MERCENARIES</strong></p><p>Complaint<a href="file:///C:/Users/FBLADE/Desktop/Yemen1/Legal/UN/Complaints/USE%20OF%20MERCENARIES/Complaint%20-%20Use%20of%20Mercenaries%20By%20Saudi-led%20Coalition%20-%2010%20March%202016.doc#_edn1">[1]</a> to the Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries regarding the hiring of mercenaries by the Saudi-led Coalition to violate human rights in Yemen and impede the exercise of the Yemeni people’s right to self-determination.</p><p><strong>Historical Background</strong></p><p>6. On 21 January 2014, the same political parties and factions that signed off on the GCC Initiative extended Hadi’s term for another year in the last month before expiry of his two year term. On 17 January 2015, Hadi managed to issue a draft constitution towards the last month of his extended term but it was unpopular and he never managed to hold general elections. He resigned on January 22, 2015 and did not withdraw his resignation before expiry of his extended term despite calls by the political parties and factions for him to do so. He then left Sanaa for Aden where he claimed he was still the President despite having resigned and his mandate expiring as well. He attempted to move the government to Aden but then was chased out of Yemen army Yemeni army due to what they claimed was a dereliction of duty He became a fugitive on the run managing to escape to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where he allegedly requested the Saudi Arabian government to conduct a war on Yemen in order to re-install him as President of Yemen.</p><p><strong>Statement of Facts and Allegations</strong></p><p>10. On 4 May 2015, Senegal’s Foreign Minister Mankeur Ndiaye confirmed that Senegal would be sending 2,100 troops to Saudi Arabia to fight alongside the Coalition against the people of Yemen and suppress their right to self-determination. According to a Washington Post article, Andrew Lebovich - a security and political analyst focused on West Africa - stated that the “most obvious potential benefit of a Senegalese military engagement alongside Saudi Arabia would be in the form of closer political and economic ties between the two, and almost certainly direct cash payments from Saudi Arabia to Senegal.”<a href="file:///C:/Users/FBLADE/Desktop/Yemen1/Legal/UN/Complaints/USE%20OF%20MERCENARIES/Complaint%20-%20Use%20of%20Mercenaries%20By%20Saudi-led%20Coalition%20-%2010%20March%202016.doc#_edn6">[6]</a></p><p>11. The Coalition was able to find a paid partner in Sudan. According to some media reports, Sudan received USD 2.2 billion in financial grants from Saudi Arabia and Qatar and in return sent a reported 6000-10000 Sudanese troops to Yemen to fight alongside the Coalition.<a href="file:///C:/Users/FBLADE/Desktop/Yemen1/Legal/UN/Complaints/USE%20OF%20MERCENARIES/Complaint%20-%20Use%20of%20Mercenaries%20By%20Saudi-led%20Coalition%20-%2010%20March%202016.doc#_edn7">[7]</a> The participation of Sudan in the Coalition against Yemen was based on a decision made by Mr. Omar Albashir and his Minister of Defense, Mr. Abdulrahim Hussein,<a href="file:///C:/Users/FBLADE/Desktop/Yemen1/Legal/UN/Complaints/USE%20OF%20MERCENARIES/Complaint%20-%20Use%20of%20Mercenaries%20By%20Saudi-led%20Coalition%20-%2010%20March%202016.doc#_edn8">[8]</a> without justification warranting such aggression and without a supportive UN mandate.</p><p>12. The Coalition was also able to hire mercenaries from Reflex Responses, a private company connected to Erik Prince, the founder of the private company known as Blackwater.<a href="file:///C:/Users/FBLADE/Desktop/Yemen1/Legal/UN/Complaints/USE%20OF%20MERCENARIES/Complaint%20-%20Use%20of%20Mercenaries%20By%20Saudi-led%20Coalition%20-%2010%20March%202016.doc#_edn9">[9]</a> On 25 November 2015, The New York times reported that some of the mercenaries now in Yemen, “… handpicked from a brigade of some 1,800 Latin American soldiers training at an Emirati military base, were woken up in the middle of the night for their deployment to Yemen last month. They were ushered out of their barracks as their bunkmates continued sleeping, and were later issued dog tags and ranks in the Emirati military. Those left behind are now being trained to use grenade launchers and armored vehicles that Emirati troops are currently using in Yemen.” <a href="file:///C:/Users/FBLADE/Desktop/Yemen1/Legal/UN/Complaints/USE%20OF%20MERCENARIES/Complaint%20-%20Use%20of%20Mercenaries%20By%20Saudi-led%20Coalition%20-%2010%20March%202016.doc#_edn10">[10]</a> According to the New York Times article, the mercenaries received salaries ranging from USD $2,000 - $3,000 per month while training in Zayed Military City, compared to their $400 monthly salary they would make in Colombia.

The International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries affirms that the recruitment, use, financing and training of mercenaries should be considered as offenses of grave concern to all states and that any person committing any of these offenses should be either prosecuted or extradited.<a href="file:///C:/Users/FBLADE/Desktop/Yemen1/Legal/UN/Complaints/USE%20OF%20MERCENARIES/Complaint%20-%20Use%20of%20Mercenaries%20By%20Saudi-led%20Coalition%20-%2010%20March%202016.doc#_edn21">[21]</a> The mercenaries used were specially recruited abroad from countries like Columbia after their selection was made by officials from the United Arab Emirates. According to the New York Times article cited above, most of the recruiting of former troops in Colombia is done by Global Enterprises, a Colombian company run by a former special operations commander named Oscar Garcia Batte who is also alleged to be co-commander of the brigade of Colombian troops in the Emirates, and is part of the force now deployed in Yemen. Furthermore, the mercenaries that were killed by the Yemeni army and Popular Committees were of various nationalities as shown in the statement of facts. The mercenaries were motivated by private gain as demonstrated by their salaries which are alleged to be upwards of USD 6000 a month. This motivation has caused what is called a “gun drain” in Columbia as mercenaries flock to Yemen in search of better wages and benefits. The individuals used as mercenaries are not nationals or members of the armies of any of the state parties to the Coalition nor are they residents of the state of Yemen, where the attacks are directed.</p><p>29. Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) recognizes the right to self-determination and accordingly recognizes the right of all peoples to freely determine their political status. Additionally, Article 6 recognizes the inherent right to life and provides that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life. The recruitment of Blackwater mercenaries by the Coalition has impeded the right of the people to self-determination and has played a role in the suppression of Yemen’s peaceful transition to a new government inclusive of all parties and factions in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.</p><p>30. We request the Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries to work alongside the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure the perpetrators are punished by appropriate penalties which take into account the grave nature of these offenses. We also request the Office of the High Commissioner to apply pressure on the Coalition, particularly the United Arab Emirates, to take all practicable measures to prevent preparations in their respective territories for the commission of those offences within or outside their territories, including the prohibition of illegal activities of persons, groups and organizations that encourage, instigate, organize or engage in the perpetration of offences and to coordinate the taking of administrative and other measures as appropriate to prevent the commission of those offenses.</p><p><a href="http://arwarights.org/foreign-mercenaries-file">http://arwarights.org/foreign-mercenaries-file</a></p><p><strong>10.5.2016 – Doctors Without Borders (** B H K)</strong></p><p><strong>The effect of war on children, narrated by a pediatrician</strong></p><p>Mohammed Musoke, is a pediatrician who works with MSF in Yemen as the activities medical coordinator since January 2015. Here he narrates the impact of war on children from his experience.</p><p>“I first worked in Yemen in 2011 in Al-Talh hospital in Sa’ada and then later in the MSF Emergency Surgical Hospital in Aden in 2012. This time, I came to Yemen a few months before the war broke out. At that time, most of our activities were regular and stable projects.</p><p>When the war broke out in March 2015, I was in Sana’a. The needs in the fields grew bigger and needs in frontlines emerged so we changed from a stable regular mission to an emergency mission. For instance our activity increased by over 200% in Aden. We also started new activities that did not exist before the war such as supporting internal displaced people and supporting health centres in several governorates in Yemen.</p><p>The load on our hospitals was increasing as many other hospitals stopped functioning because of the war or because it was dangerous for patients to move to hospitals. We were receiving children from areas as far as Sa’ada, which is five hours away from Khamer. Unfortunately, if the patients were not hospitalized in the right time, some diseases can be fatal.</p><p>We were receiving complicated maternity cases throughout 2015 as women used to take very long time to come to us. Eventually many of them had complicated deliveries caused by high blood pressure, excessive bleeding or other causes. This made us start supporting the referral system and emergency rooms in areas where patients were not able to come to our hospitals. People were not able to move because of lack of fuel or the high prices of transportation they were not able to afford. Sometimes, what was making people stay home without treatment was the fear of airstrikes or ground conflict.</p><p>During my work time in Al-Salam Hospital in Amran, I saw many complicated paediatric cases because of severe chest infections, and children with severe dehydration due to diarrhea. What was frustrating for me as a paediatrician was to see children with deteriorating health condition that could have been avoided if these children had earlier access to primary healthcare when they needed it. The results were fatal sometimes. I remember receiving some children who had chest infections, which spread to the brain to become meningitis. As a consequence of meningitis there some children who had regression of their developmental milestones and were no longer able to walk, play or even able to sit and talk because they became mentally retarded, . These complications could have been easily prevented if had come earlier to the hospital and received appropriate treatment..</p><p>The war has affected babies before they were born. In July, we received a 21 year old mother who had been in labour for almost two days. She was not able to go to the health centre because the road was not safe. By the time, she arrived to Al-Salam Hospital; she was in obstructed labour with foetal distress. When this mother arrived to the hospital, the baby was alive but with brain damage that was caused by the prolonged labour. The mother had to stay in the hospital for two weeks to prevent more complications that happened to her urinary bladder but the baby is not going to live a normal life because of the brain injury.</p><p>All I have mentioned above was about the north. The situation in the south was complicated in a different way. To start with, I was supposed to have a field visit to Aden in late March but the security situation worsened and I was not able to move as the airport was closed and some roads between Sana’a and Aden were cut because of tense fighting. When I finally managed to travel to Aden on March 27th, I could see the impact of the conflict right from the beginning. Among the war wounded we received were civilians; including women and children as old as nine months. We received a nine-month baby with a shrapnel injury in the abdomen. The mother told us that she was carrying her baby while running away when there was shelling. The child had an operation in our hospital and he responded well to the treatment.</p><p>Not all the stories I know had happy endings though. I remember we received in the early days of the war a family of five members after a rocket landed in their home. The father lost both legs; the mother had abdomen and head injury, their seven year old boy lost one leg and the five years old daughter lost her hand. Unfortunately the family lost their 10 year old child in the incident. The father was giving up on life after losing his child and after what happened to him and his family.</p><p>Although it’s sad for me to remember that incident, I was relieved and glad to see the family again in February this year during my visit to our hospital in Aden. The father, his son and his daughter came to receive physiotherapy after they had prosthetic limbs.</p><p>It was a great moment for me to see the father smiling again after he almost lost hope in life – by Mohammed Musoke</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=984624668312488&amp;id=365494296892198&amp;substory_index=0">https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=984624668312488&amp;id=365494296892198&amp;substory_index=0</a></p><p><strong>12.5.2016 – IRIN (** A H)</strong></p><p><strong>WFP warns money running out to feed Yemen</strong></p><p>With ongoing violence and peace talks on fragile ground, Yemen’s population faces a new threat: the World Food Programme has warned that a funding shortfall may soon force it to halt operations in the country.</p><p>“We are on the edge,” WFP’s country director in Yemen, Purnima Kashyap, told IRIN. “By July we will have no resources available and will not be able to deliver [food] starting in August.”</p><p>At the moment, Kashyap explained, WFP is only able to provide food or food vouchers to a fraction of those who need it – 3.59 million in March.

In Sana’a, where Saudi Arabia earlier this week threatened to send troops if peace talks fail, anonymous donors have sent a dozen refrigerators to restaurants across the city.</p><p>They’re filled with donations from locals who have extras, leftovers from the restaurants themselves, and with purchases from customers who can pitch in extra cash.</p><p>At al-Saeed, a restaurant with a new fridge, cashier Faisal Taher said they’re able to give some 31 people three meals a day.</p><p>“Some people give us money and ask us to buy food [to add], others bring it from home, and the restaurant [also donates some],” he explained.</p><p>26-year-old Madian al-Daghour is one of the beneficiaries. Originally from Taiz, he’s been living in the capital for two months while his father undergoes treatment for lung cancer.</p><p>Life was so expensive in Sana’a that Daghour said he couldn’t afford food anymore, and was considering ending his father’s treatment and heading home.</p><p>He doesn’t know who installed the fridge in a restaurant near the hospital (several are near medical centres), but “they told people they can get free food from here.”</p><p>Daghour and his father now have enough to eat, and his father can continue receiving treatment.</p><p>Locals like Mohmmad al-Omari have taken notice.

This ends a year of occupation and brings to a close what is effectively the third emirate or statelet AQAP has either set up or attempted to set up in Yemen since 2011. These projects offer some insights into al-Qaeda’s methodology in getting to an Islamic state, including its rebranding in opposition to the Islamic State (IS).</p><p>Bin Ladin’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/01/rags-to-riches-story-of-the-bin-laden-family-is-woven-with-tragedy">ancestral</a> homeland is in Hadramut in southern Yemen and he had tried to foment Islamist revolution there since 1989-90. Al-Qaeda’s first terrorist attack against America took place in Yemen on 29 December 1992, with the bombings in Aden of the Gold Mohur Hotel and the Aden Mövenpick Hotel targeting American Marines—who were on their way to Somalia to help alleviate the suffering of a (Muslim) population afflicted by famine and war. Much to Bin Ladin’s disappointment, the Yemeni population bought into Yemeni unification and the tribal and patronage networks of the new system. With the hopes of an Islamist statelet in Yemen dashed, al-Qaeda nonetheless maintained Yemen connections as a throughway and fundraiser.</p><p>Picking through the wreckage after al-Qaeda’s attempts at state-management had ended in catastrophe in Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, and Mali, the change of direction Bin Ladin had been advocating in his final days now took hold among his subordinates. Al-Wuhayshi, al-Qaeda’s general manager as well as AQAP’s leader, understood that the project in Yemen had gone wrong. On 21 May 2012, weeks before AQAP was ejected from Ja’ar and its statelet disbanded, al-Wuhayshi <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/images/al-qaida-papers-how-to-run-a-state.pdf">wrote</a> to Abdelmalik Droukdel (Abu Musab Abdul Wadud), the leader of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which had invaded northern Mali in January 2012 and received an enormous boost after the military overthrew the government in March, leaving Bamako a shambles as the jihadists dug in. Still, al-Wuhayshi sensed danger, warning AQIM of the need to “keep the [media] message under control,” and cautioning that AQAP had learned lessons from its mistakes that had now united tribes, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Salafists against them.</p><p>The themes of al-Qaeda’s new model were sharpening into view: Muslim societies had been stripped of real religious understanding (the notion of Sayyid Qutb that this was a new age of <span>jahiliya</span>, ignorance and paganism) and therefore had to be led gradually back into it; applying the full shari’a immediately would lead to a rejection of the jihadists and their ideas, not least because so many enemies were waiting for the jihadists to falter in order to take advantage and extinguish the true Islam; and the key to success was to make the population and al-Qaeda co-dependent—al-Qaeda would solve the population’s most pressing needs (whether that was fighting the government or social services) so that population felt its interests were coterminous with al-Qaeda’s and would protect the group, providing a bodyguard and durable roots for al-Qaeda’s global agenda.</p><p>These lessons had been assimilated when AQAP <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/04/world/middleeast/al-qaeda-al-mukalla-yemen.html">overran</a> al-Mukalla on 3 April 2015, capturing large amounts of American-supplied equipment, the day after AQAP had <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/04/al-qaeda-takes-control-of-eastern-yemeni-city.php">systematically seized</a> key facilities, including Hadramut Province’s security headquarters, the local police station, provincial administrative offices, a branch of the central bank, and the Central Prison, breaking free more than three-hundred people, including Khaled al-Batarfi, an AQAP military operations chief for Abyan and Baydah Provinces when he was captured in March 2011. This time, AQAP would “pose as a local protector-savior rather than an overlord in Mukalla,” as Yemen researcher Elisabeth Kendall <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/05/03/how-can-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula-be-defeated/">noted</a>. AQAP’s ideology was not widely shared in the areas it captured, but the creation of a pseudo-state where “even its detractors grudgingly acknowledged that AQAP was approachable, had some sense of justice and got things done,” meant AQAP “succeed in building tolerance for [its presence], if not outright support,” Kendall adds.</p><p>AQAP’s capture of al-Mukalla came just over a week after a Saudi-led coalition launched Operation DECISIVE STORM on 25 March 2015, which was designed to push back the Houthis and restore the political process. With other priorities, the Saudi-led forces had, until April 2016, essentially ignored AQAP and AQAP had kept very quiet about its holdings, not claiming any kind of state or emirate, and worked to embed itself within the wider insurgent movement in Yemen.

There was a major ground operation of more than 2,000 foreign troops and local forces led by the United Arab Emirates into al-Mukalla, but while the Coalition <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/800-al-qaeda-fighters-killed-yemen-anti-jihad-022214328.html">claimed</a> that 800 AQAP jihadists had been killed, the real figure is probably <a href="https://twitter.com/YemenPostNews/status/724500095249600512">closer to sixty</a>. AQAP itself <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/05/aqap-says-it-withdrew-from-mukalla-to-protect-residents.php">said</a> that it had withdrawn—ostensibly to protect civilians—rather than having been routed. In short, after a year of controlling the city, embedding itself into social networks, proselytizing, collecting taxes, looting arms munitions and banks, AQAP pulled out of al-Mukalla and lived to fight another day. Thus, the <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/us-middle-east-victory-al-qaeda-213864">suggestion</a> this is as big a victory as if IS had been driven from Mosul or Raqqa is at best misleading.</p><p>The DECISIVE STORM operation now seems to have moved against al-Qaeda, as well as Iran’s instruments in Yemen, but how sustained that effort will be—and how successful, given how powerful AQAP was allowed to become—remains to be seen – by Kyle Orton</p><p><a href="https://kyleorton1991.wordpress.com/2016/05/10/yemen-and-al-qaedas-long-term-strategy/">https://kyleorton1991.wordpress.com/2016/05/10/yemen-and-al-qaedas-long-term-strategy/</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp2 Allgemein / General</strong></span></h2><p>11.5.2016 – Alwaght (A K P)</p><p>Saudi Arabia to Perform Major Military Operation with Direct Support of US: Yemeni Commander</p><p>A senior Yemeni Commander has reported that Saudi Regime is preparing for a major military operation with direct support of America.</p><p>Mohamad Salman al-Salman, Yemeni commander, in a talk with Fars News Agency announced the preparation of Saudis for a major military operation with US direct backup.</p><p>Considering the deployment of hundreds of American forces to Yemen’s south, Mohamad Salman al-Salman said that the presence of US forces caused a surge in growth of terrorists and mercenary soldiers in regions adjacent to their Basement.</p><p>Also on Monday Sadeq abu-Shwareb, the member of Yemen’s Supreme Revolutionary Committee, stressed the Support of US for spreading terrorism in the region and in an interview with Alwaght said: “the US intervention in Yemen is not to confront Al-Qaeda; they have created Al-Qaeda and they have empowered it in some parts of Yemen’s southern and eastern provinces, and I repeat that the reason is to cover up the scandal of the US as it backed the Saudi regime militarily and logistically and also by intelligence assistance.”</p><p><a href="http://alwaght.com/en/News/53325">http://alwaght.com/en/News/53325</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp3 Humanitäre Lage / Humanitarian situation</strong></span></h2><p>12.5.2016 – ICRC (A H)</p><p>Children can keep their childhood thanks to Red Crescent volunteers in Yemen</p><p>Life has forever changed for Yemenis and non-Yemenis in the country, and for children, coping with the situation has been particularly difficult. In an attempt to allow children in Yemen to just be children, and to relieve some of the stress that these uncertain times have brought upon them, Yemen Red Crescent Society is providing psychosocial support at six schools in the Beni Hushaish district in the governorate of Sana’a.</p><p>In the first month of the project, which is supported and funded by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), 242 young students will take part in daily activities with trained Red Crescent volunteers. Rooms at the six schools have been renovated for the use of the programme, and completed with a huge collection of games to encourage expression in the safe space provided for girls and boys. The volunteers of the Red Crescent also held psychosocial support sessions for children at district level.</p><p>“Students in Yemen have been feeling disconnected from school and are not motivated to continue their education - many have withdrawn from classes. They are overwhelmed by the conflict and did not feel safe hearing the sounds of bombs and warplanes,” said Mr Adel Thamer, a Red Crescent volunteer who oversees the psychosocial programme.</p><p>“Our programme helps them express themselves. They were reluctant at first, but then they started interacting more and more with us. The number of returnees to schools has increased since the beginning of the programme. Now we are also engaging with more children, including those that are successful students as they are going through the same stresses and also need a safe environment.”</p><p>The project was inaugurated on 25 April 2016, in the presence of a psychosocial support team from the Yemen Red Crescent Society, representative from the local Beni Hushaish branch, the principals of the schools taking part, and officials representing the ministry of education at the governorate.</p><p>During the tour of the schools, the Red Crescent noted the poor conditions of these educational institutions and the lack of available equipment. The National Society plans on renovating classrooms and toilets, establishing first aid posts and supporting schools by providing swings, slides as well as climbing frames.</p><p>Despite the lack of resources and the challenging security situation across many parts of the country, Yemen Red Crescent Society continues to be the main community-based humanitarian actor in Yemen. The aid provided by the volunteers go beyond the mere delivery of relief items, to the provision of basic medical services and psychosocial support to communities, to ensure that their health and mental well-being is cared for amid the instability surrounding them.</p><p>Yemen Red Crescent Society works with the support of the ICRC, IFRC, and many National Society partners from overseas – By Soraya Dali-Balta, IFRC</p><p><a href="http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/middle-east-and-north-africa/yemen/children-can-keep-their-childhood-thanks-to-red-crescent-volunteers-in-yemen-72208/">http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/middle-east-and-north-africa/yemen/children-can-keep-their-childhood-thanks-to-red-crescent-volunteers-in-yemen-72208/</a></p><p>12.5.2016 – UN News Centre (B H)</p><p>Yemen’s food situation on verge of ‘humanitarian disaster’ – UN</p><p>The food security and nutrition situation in Yemen will turn into a humanitarian disaster unless urgent funding is accessible for the Food and Agriculture Organization (<a href="http://www.fao.org/">FAO</a>) to deliver timely aid in the April/May cereal and vegetable planting season and the summer fishing season, and vaccinate livestock before winter, the United Nations agency has warned.</p><p>Around 14.4 million people – over half of Yemen's population – urgently need food security and livelihood assistance, FAO <a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/fao-yemen-situation-report-9-may-2016">reported</a> earlier this week. The volume of food required in Yemen is far greater than humanitarian actors can provide. Agriculture must be an integral part of the humanitarian response to prevent Yemen's dire food security situation from worsening.</p><p>Increasing households' resilience to food security threats will contribute to saving many lives. Emergency agricultural interventions are critical to preserving household. Food production and income generation are especially vital in hard-to-reach areas where aid access is limited.</p><p>The factors negatively affecting the food security include a reported desert locust outbreak, which threatens the livelihoods of more than 100,000 farmers, beekeepers and herders in five governorates, and the April flooding, which put 49,000 people in need of urgent assistance, the FAO said.</p><p><a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53912#.VzTDj_mLSUm">http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53912#.VzTDj_mLSUm</a></p><p>12.5.2016 – World Food Programme (B H)</p><p>WFP Yemen Situation Report #21, 11 May 2016 (covering the period 10 March—11 May)</p><p>In Numbers</p><p>21.2 million (82 percent of population) in need of humanitarian assistance (2016 Yemen Humanitarian Needs Overview)</p><p>14.4 million food insecure of which 7.6 million severely food insecure (2016 HNO)</p><p>2.8 million internally displaced (HCT Task Force on Population Movement, 8th Report,<br /> April 2016)</p><p>92,500 refugee and migrant arrivals in Yemen from the Horn of Africa, Oman and Saudi Arabia in 2015 (UNHCR)</p><p>Highlights</p><p>In April 2016, WFP exceeded its monthly General Food Distribution (GFD) target of 3 million beneficiaries, reaching 3.18 million people in 19 governorates. 225,515 people in Sana’a, Aden and Taizz benefited from 2,352 mt of food assistance received through commodity vouchers. In March, WFP distributed food for 3.4 million beneficiaries in 17 governorates, surpassing its monthly GFD target of 3 million people assisted. In addition, 195,000 people received food received 2,364 mt through WFP’s commodity vouchers distributed in Sana’a and Aden.</p><p>WFP Yemen will face shortfalls for its GFD and commodity vouchers activities under EMOP 200890, starting July 2016. Given the long lead times, potentially up to 4.5 months, urgent resources are required immediately to prevent a pipeline break/drastic reduction in food assistance. WFP Yemen’s Nutrition programme is facing a similar shortfall, causing treatment of malnourishment activities to be prioritised over prevention activities.</p><p>WFP Response</p><p>During April and May, WFP conducted field monitoring missions to the southwestern city of Dhamar and within Sana’a governorate to inspect food distribution points and meet with cooperating partners and local leaders. WFP monitors also visited Amran to assess damage caused by April flash floods that affected over 49,000 people in seven governorates. The WFP Country Director led missions to Ibb and Taizz and oversaw the distribution of food to over 3,000 households (approximately 18,000 people) in Taizz City’s besieged Al Qahira area and neighbouring Attaiziah.</p><p>Together with its flood assessment missions, WFP assisted 1,741 flood-affected families (10,500 people) in Amran and 150 families (900 people) in Hajjah with oneoff food entitlements. In addition, as part of the April GFD, WFP reached 543,000 people in Hajjah, 205,400 people in Hudaydah, 117,300 people in Amran and 233,600 people in Sana’a.</p><p><a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/wfp-yemen-situation-report-21-11-may-2016-covering-period-10-march-11-may">http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/wfp-yemen-situation-report-21-11-may-2016-covering-period-10-march-11-may</a> and in full <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/wfp283852.pdf">http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/wfp283852.pdf</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp4 Kulturerbe / Cultural heritage</strong></span></h2><p>12.5.2016 – Beautiful Yemen (D)</p><p>The Yemeni Ministry of Culture, the Beautiful Yemen team and the Istituto Veneto per I Beni Culturali are proud to announce that the Republic of Yemen will be represented for the first time at the 15<sup>th</sup> International Architecture Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia.

The campaign targeted male labourers who work on daily wages in several Adani districts, and transferred them to military camps in preparation for deporting them from the city. <br /> The news solicited much heated debate. Even the president and his newly appointed prime minister, who are both from the south, condemned this move on the part of Aden security, and termed it an instigation of racial hatred, claiming that it "further supports former president Saleh's cause and his militia, who are trying to come back to power".</p><p>However, upon closer inspection of what really happened, it turns out that not all the arrested men were from the north. In fact, some were from southern cities including Aden, Lahj, Abyan and Yafe. Moreover, those who presented a civilian ID were released and those who failed to present any ID or had a military/security IDs were sent out of the city to their home towns. <br /> The raids targeted gatherings of daily workers who lived in garages, workshops and motels. Aden's security had received intelligence about sleeping cells affiliated with the Political and Central Security Bodies who are still controlled by former president Saleh. This caused them to panic and raid some areas, in order to expel anyone not in possession of a legitimate ID or proof of residence.</p><p>While I am not a security expert, plain common sense is enough to see this is a bad move. And finally, the most important aspect of security, I believe, is public trust. The backlash among the public following the incident not only undermines police authority, but also instigates disorder and deepens ethnic hatred between north and south.<br /> Moreover, condemnation on the part of the president and prime minister - both of whom are residents of Aden - of the conduct of Aden's governor and chief of security, sends a strong message that the two groups are not working together, an even more disturbing prospect than having Saleh's sleeping cells in the city – by Nadia al-Sakkaf</p><p><a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2016/5/12/ethnic-hatred-in-yemen">https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2016/5/12/ethnic-hatred-in-yemen</a></p><p>11.5.2016 – Almanar (* A K P)</p><p>Yémen: Qui est derrière l’épuration ethnique et confessionnelle à Aden ?</p><p>L’observatoire yéménite des droits de l’Homme a condamné dans un communiqué officiel publié ce mercredi les pratiques des forces de l’ordre yéménite alliés à la coalition, dont entre autres : le transfert forcé des yéménites qui ne sont pas originaires d’Aden vers les provinces de Taez et les autres villes du nord.</p><p>« Des centaines de citoyens yéménites ont été entassés comme les animaux dans des bus et dans les coffres des camions », s’est indigné le rédacteur en chef du journal panarabe Rai al-Yom, Abdel Bari Atwan.</p><p>« Le prétexte avancé par les autorités proche la coalition c’est que ces citoyens yéménites ne portent pas de carte d’identité.

The trouble with all sides in this disgusting war is that they care about saving face more than they care about saving Yemen. And that goes for the Saudis as well as their opponents. After all, Saudi doesn't want to appear to give in to the Houthis unless it can definitely demonstrate that it has actually done something in Yemen - and so far, there is nothing they can point to. And Taiz militia leaders say they won't accept a political solution in their city - they only will accept a military solution.

The Kingdom’s government is said to have approved the video, and that is why it was given airtime on national television.</p><p>After airing the video in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi government released the controversial video in the United States via the Washington DC-based Middle East Media Research Institute, in April 2016. Women activists group describe the video as nothing less than infuriating.</p><p>The content of the video features the doctor who is said to specialize in therapy; Khaled Al-Saqaby teaching men how to ‘properly’ beat their wives if their [wives] disobey them.</p><p>According to Al-Saqaby, husbands should not immediately attack their wives, but should discipline them ‘properly’ first. He then makes it clear that in marriage, there is nothing like equality, and that men should take charged and rule the home.</p><p>In an event where women disobey their husbands, Al-Saqaby teaches in the video that the men should follow the steps below in making sure that the women are corrected.</p><p>“The first step is to remind her of your rights and of her duties according to Allah. Then comes the second step – forsaking her in bed. The third step, beating, has to correspond with the necessary Islamic conditions” before taking action. The beating should not be performed with a rod, nor should it be a headband, or a sharp object. Instead, husbands should use a ‘tooth-cleaning twig or with a handkerchief’ to beat their wife. The wife will feel that she was wrong in the way she treated her husband,” says Al-Saqaby.</p><p>Ending his controversial teaching, Al-Saqaby says his teaching of how to beat wives is not exhaustive, and that sometimes, men can beat their wives without following his steps when the women go to the extreme by disobeying their husbands.</p><p>He also blamed the women for provoking their husbands, expressing shock that some women are ‘stubborn’ to the point that only beatings can bring them to order.</p><p>“In addition, sometimes a woman makes a mistake that may lead her husband to beat her. I’m sad to say there are some women who say ‘Go ahead, if you are a real man, beat me’ She provokes them,” he adds in the video.</p><p><a href="http://www.awdnews.com/top-news/saudi-arabia-releases-video-on-national-television-teaching-husbands-how-to-beat-their-wives-video">http://www.awdnews.com/top-news/saudi-arabia-releases-video-on-national-television-teaching-husbands-how-to-beat-their-wives-video</a></p><p>Comment: Our very best friends…</p><p>10.5.2016 – Express (A)</p><p>Saudi religious police spark outrage 'after BITING woman who filmed assault on phone'</p><p>A MEMBER of Saudi Arabia's religious police bit a woman in a shocking attack, it was claimed last night.</p><p><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/668731/Saudi-Arabia-religious-police-Jeddah-Islam">http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/668731/Saudi-Arabia-religious-police-Jeddah-Islam</a></p><p>9.5.2016 – Money Morning (A E P)</p><p>Saudi Aramco IPO: The Biggest Problem with the $2.5 Trillion "Deal of the Century"</p><p>A new report from <em>The Telegraph</em> today (Monday, May 9) revealed some major new details regarding the <a href="http://moneymorning.com/tag/ipo-calendar/">Saudi Aramco IPO</a>.</p><p>It also revealed the deal's biggest problem – and how one country's investors could miss out on the largest stock offering in history.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about the Saudi Aramco IPO's latest news…</p><p>According to <em>The Telegraph</em>, the state-owned oil giant is seeking a three-way listing of its shares on London, Hong Kong, and New York stock exchanges.</p><p>And London's chance of being included in the <a href="http://moneymorning.com/tag/ipo-calendar/">Saudi Aramco IPO listing</a>increased with last week's election.

Jeff Davis would not even say how many U.S. troops had been deployed, for what exact length of time and under what legal authority (Obama has not held a congressional vote over the Yemen war). Davis only said the U.S. is sending a “very small number” of forces to support United Arab Emirate’s ground combat against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).</p><p>Amid the Obama administration’s relative silence, <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2016/05/257074.htm">brief comments</a> made by state department press spokesperson Elizabeth Trudeau to reporters on Tuesday shed light on the incoherent justifications that underlie the ramping up of America's role.</p><p>Asked by an unidentified reporter whether the U.S. deployments are part of a “grander plan to bring about stability,” Trudeau replied: “So, no, this was limited support. So the Department of Defense has actually spoken to this. U.S. Central Command provided limited support to an anti-al-Qaida of the Arabian Peninsula operation led by Yemeni, Saudi, and Emirati forces in and around Mukalla. We remain concerned about AQAP and we welcome the operations taken by the Yemeni forces with the support of the Emirati and the Saudi forces to address this. It was limited.”</p><p>In fact, the Saudi-led campaign has significantly strengthened AQAP, as well as ISIS.</p><p>The state department does not dispute this fact, as revealed by the following excerpt from Tuesday’s briefing:</p><p>So the U.S. admits that it is ramping up a war that has strengthened the forces it claims to be fighting. However, reality is even more nefarious. A recently-released PBS Frontline documentary by journalist Safa Al Ahmad <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/yemen-under-siege/">reveals</a> that combatants from the Saudi-led coalition are fighting alongside militants affiliated with Al Qaeda in the Yemeni city of Taiz.</p><p>The BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35630194">acknowledged</a> that Al Ahmad’s film provides evidence “that troops from a Saudi-led coalition force and Al Qaeda militants are both fighting Houthi rebels in a key battle. On a visit to the frontline near the city of Taiz, a documentary maker filmed jihadists as well as UAE-supported pro-government militiamen.”</p><p>This is not the first report of its kind.</p><p>The current Yemen war, meanwhile, is <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/01/a-special-relationship/?single=1">not the first time</a> that the U.S. has directly or indirectly cooperated with Al Qaeda affiliates around the world.</p><p>So AQAP is not only growing in strength because it is “taking advantage” of the chaos, as Trudeau characterized it. Rather, some of its forces are fighting alongside elements of the coalition. Whatever the extent of this collaboration, the fact that Al Qaeda affiliates are growing in strength as a result of the coalition’s war is indisputable. What evidence suggests that an escalation of this failed war will somehow yield a different result?</p><p>Yet, in the name of fighting Al Qaeda, the United States increasing its participation in a coalition that has unleashed extraordinary bloodshed on ordinary people throughout the country.</p><p>Now U.S. troops appear to be fighting in alliance with forces that are, in fact, associated with Al Qaeda. Meanwhile, the mission continues to creep with little debate within the United States.

The Pentagon spokesman called it "a very small team" that will be "providing intelligence support" and whose role will be "short term."

While much of the media coverage focused on <a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/contextualizing-israeli-concerns-about-the-iran-nuclear-deal">Israeli resistance to the deal</a>, at least as much hostility <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/19/politics/situation-room-saudi-arabia-foreign-minister/">emanated from Riyadh</a>, where Iran is seen as a regional rival.</p><p>According to the Saudi narrative, Iran represents a threat to the status quo, particularly though its influence within Shia communities, both in the kingdom itself and its neighbouring states. Along these lines, the KSA has identified Iranian influence as a cause of problems in <a href="http://time.com/4174837/yemen-analysis/">Yemen</a>, <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/03/iran-bahrain-saraya-mukhtar.html">Bahrain</a> and its own restive <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/01/06/one-map-that-explains-the-dangerous-saudi-iranian-conflict/">Eastern Province</a>.</p><p>Moreover, though the KSA is in receipt of significant support from the US for, inter alia, its ongoing war in Yemen, it also looks upon the potential for a thaw in US-Iran relations as a strategic threat.</p><p>The most immediate threat to Saudi interests, though, has been a diversification of how to obtain fossil fuels. In particular, oil produced by new technologies such as <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-14432401">fracking</a>, have already changed the nature of the global energy market noticeably.</p><p>How the disastrous ongoing conflicts in Syria and Yemen play out will obviously have a major bearing on the nature of the US-KSA relationship. While, as noted above, the US and KSA are apparently locked in step over Yemen, there is a greater chance of friction between the two the longer the conflict drags on, particularly as US interests come under <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/04/12/two-ways-the-war-in-yemen-is-turning-into-a-disaster-for-the-u-s/?tid=a_inl">increasing stress</a>.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is in Syria where there is most obvious tension between Washington and Riyadh.</p><p>There have been several actions by the Saudi government mentioned here, and in a <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20160503-whats-going-on-in-americas-relationship-with-saudi-arabia/">previous article</a>, which suggest that the kingdom may be seeking to steer a different course, with a greater emphasis on independence from the US.</p><p>It was not all that long ago that Washington was apparently alarmed by the prospect of a <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/07/will-the-united-states-help-if-saudi-arabia-starts-to-fall-apart/">potential regime collapse in the Kingdom of Saudi A</a>rabia.

Since KSA started their killing and destruction campaign their numbers swelled to thousands, maybe tens of thousands. And now with US boots on the ground who knows what will happen.

Viele der Flüchtlinge leben im Lager Darwan, etwa 40 Kilometer von der Hauptstadt entfernt. Euronews-Reporter Mohammed Shaikhibrahim hat das Camp besucht. Die Hauptursache für die Flucht sind laut Hilfsorganisationen die Luftangriffe der <a href="http://de.euronews.com/2016/02/25/jemen-krieg-europaparlament-empfiehlt-waffenembargo-gegen-saudi-arabien/">saudisch angeführten Militärkoalition</a> auf vermeintliche Stellungen der Huthi-Rebellen.

Wir haben es irgendwann geschafft, Sada zu verlassen. Das war nicht einfach, denn die Angriffe haben eine ganze Woche gedauert.”</p><p>Die Bewohner des Flüchtlingslagers haben sich Behausungen aus Steinen gebaut, die sie in der Gegend gefunden haben. Nicht nur Essen und Trinkwasser sind knapp. “Nachts ist es kalt und wir frieren”, erzählt eine geflüchtete Frau. “Tagsüber leiden wir unter der sengenden Sonne. Manchmal bekommen meine Kinder für drei bis vier Tage nichts zu essen. Es gibt zu wenig Wasser und Gas. Es fehlt an allem.”</p><p>Viele der Kinder im Lager Darwan sind krank. Doch sie erhalten keine Behandlung. Hilfsorganisationen beklagen, dass die Lage der Menschen im Jemen angesichts anderer Kriege vergessen wird. Jamie McGoldrick, UN-Hilfskoordinator für das Land nennt die Zustände “alarmierend”: “14 Millionen Menschen sind auf Hilfe angewiesen. Die Sicherheit von sieben Millionen Menschen ist ernsthaft bedroht. Drei Millionen Kinder in diesem Land gehen nicht zur Schule. Ihr Leben ist nichts als Schmerz. Man muss sich die Gesundheitsversorgung angucken und sich vor Augen führt, wie schwierig es ist, Essen, Medikamente und Benzin ins Land zu bringen. Das alles schadet der Zukunft der Kinder.”</p><p>Mohammed Shaikhibrahim: “Die Flüchtlinge hier bezahlen einen hohen Preis.

Und das funktioniert.</p><p>Wie finanziert sich Al-Kaida in Jemen?</p><p>Die Gruppe hat Steuern für die einfache Bevölkerung abgeschafft. Dafür haben sie den Unternehmen hohe Steuern auferlegt. Das hat eine Art Robin-Hood-Kultur geschaffen. Die Leute sehen, dass Al-Kaida die Reichen ausraubt, um die Armen zu unterstützen. Aber es gibt noch wichtigere Einnahmequellen, wie etwa den Hafen von Mukkala, den Al-Kaida bis vor ein paar Wochen kontrollierte. Zudem finanziert sich die Gruppe über den Schmuggel und wohl auch über Lösegelder für Opfer von Entführungen.</p><p>Im Westen ist Al-Kaida bekannt für brutale Methoden der Bestrafung gemäss der Scharia. Stossen solche Strafen die Bevölkerung nicht ab?</p><p>Das stösst eine Mehrheit der lokalen Bevölkerung ab. Deshalb ist Al-Kaida in Jemen viel vorsichtiger bei der Anwendung der Scharia gewesen.</p><p>Um die Terrororganisation aus dem Land zu vertreiben, müssen wir die Unzufriedenheit, die Marginalisierung, den Mangel an Repräsentation, die schlechten staatlichen Dienstleistungen sowie die fehlende Hoffnung der jungen Generation zum Thema machen.

AQAP has been a persistent menace since the early 2000s, exploiting periodic collapses of government military presence in the south and east. It has achieved unprecedented success during the ongoing civil war that broke out last year, capturing large amounts of military materiel, controlling a swath of terrain between the southern cities of Aden and al-Mukalla, and drawing resources from southern oil fields and ports. In response, the Saudi- and Emirati-led Gulf coalition fighting on the government's side has been redirecting a significant portion of its military efforts toward the emergent AQAP enclave in the south, especially since the campaign to retake the capital from other rebel forces became bogged down by protracted peace talks. Alongside the U.S. strikes, Gulf forces have recently rolled back AQAP control in several southern cities, ports, and energy installations.</p><p>AQAP EXPANSION DURING YEMEN'S WARS</p><p>CHALLENGING THE GOVERNMENT</p><p>COALITION RESPONSE</p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. POLICY</p><p>Late last year, AQAP was poised to control Yemen's second- and fifth-largest cities, plus its two biggest Indian Ocean ports and major energy installations. Yet the Gulf coalition forestalled that disaster through a prescient and patient buildup, followed by well-designed and decisive military operations. Since February, coalition and Yemeni forces claim to have killed 450 AQAP fighters in al-Mukalla, 120 in Aden, and 220 in other operations. If they can maintain such pressure, they can whittle AQAP back down from a quasi-government in the Islamic State mold to a highly dangerous terrorist group that deserves ongoing scrutiny.</p><p>Yet for all its potency, the Gulf coalition probably cannot maintain the current level of commitment indefinitely, and the military task of pressuring AQAP will grow more complicated if the group disperses into its mountain redoubts. The United States has acknowledged launching four airstrikes against AQAP since April 23, and it remains the only party capable of effectively tracking and targeting the group's rural camps. The anti-AQAP campaign would also be better served if the stalled peace talks with the Houthis progress, since conflict termination is in the interests of all sides except AQAP – by Michael Knights and Alexandre Mello</p><p><a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/gulf-coalition-operations-against-aqap-in-yemen">http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/gulf-coalition-operations-against-aqap-in-yemen</a></p><p>Comment: Giving also background information on Al Qaida in Yemen, this very much sounds like the official US position and wording.</p><p>5.2016 – Iran Project (unrated B T)</p><p>Al-Qaeda stronger after Saudi-led attacks on yemen</p><p>One of the major challenges of Yemen today, specifically after the air campaign of the Saudi-led Arab military coalition, is the increase in the activities of the terror group Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which has been used as a means by Saudi Arabia to proceed towards its objectives in dealing with Yemen’s resistant group Ansarulah.</p><p><a href="http://theiranproject.com/blog/2016/05/10/al-qaeda-stronger-saudi-led-attacks-yemen/">http://theiranproject.com/blog/2016/05/10/al-qaeda-stronger-saudi-led-attacks-yemen/</a></p><p>Comment: Iranian viewpoint.</p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp15 Propaganda</strong></span></h2><p>12.5.2016 – Gulf News from Washington Post (A P)</p><p>Saudi threatens to move forces into Sana’a if peace talks fail</p><p>Spokesman says they cannot leave Yemen without a final result as it will lead to Libyan model there</p><p>Saudi Arabia will send troops into Sana’a, the Yemeni capital, if peace talks between the Saudi-backed government and Al Houthi rebels fail, a military spokesman said on Wednesday, raising the spectre of extended conflict.</p><p>Brigadier General Ahmad Asiri, a spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition that has been fighting Al Houthi rebel forces for the past one year, said Saudi Arabia hoped that peace talks in Kuwait, already strained by ongoing violence on the ground, would succeed.</p><p>“We have two lines working in parallel — a political process and the military operation. One of them will reach the end,” he said. “If not, ... today we have troops around the capital, and we will get in, because the goal should be achieved which is securing Yemen.”</p><p>“Securing Yemen doesn’t mean that we will tolerate to have a militia ... controlling ballistic missiles, artillery, etc, and threatening our border and threatening the area.”</p><p>“We cannot leave Yemen in a grey area without having a final result,” he said. “Otherwise, we will see the Libyan model in Yemen.”</p><p>The general defended Saudi Arabia’s management of its air campaign against Al Houthi rebels, saying that strikes were conducted to the standard of Nato operations.</p><p>“We take all measures to conduct surgical air strikes,” he said.</p><p>The United Nations has accused the Saudi-led coalition of being responsible for twice the number of civilian casualties as other combatants in Yemen. Asiri said Saudi and allied forces systematically investigated allegations of civilian casualties but were hindered by a lack of access to Al Houthi-controlled areas.

They would just attack it and kill even more civilians, and destroy more of Yemen's infrastructure and heritage. And lets make this clear - if the US did not approve, KSA could not do it. So US are compliant with this terrible threat, which they are using as a means of trying to get their opposition to capitulate so that they can claim a false victory.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628</a></p><p>11.5.2016 – Arab News (A P)</p><p>We know where Saleh sleeps in Yemen: Asiri</p><p>The Saudi-led Arab coalition knows every movement deposed president Ali Abdullah Al-Saleh makes in Yemen, Brig. Gen. Ahmed Al-Asiri, spokesman of the coalition forces, has said.<br /> In an interview on Egyptian channel Dream, he said there was precise intelligence information about where Saleh sleeps daily.<br /> “Saleh uses the homes of ambassadors and embassies that have been evacuated. He also uses residences of international diplomatic missions, taking advantage of their immunity and his relations with them to protect himself from aerial attacks,” he said.<br /> The Arab coalition never asked Egypt to send ground forces to Yemen, he said, adding that it is voluntary.<br /> “The Yemeni army is the backbone of the operation carried out by the coalition,” he was quoted by a website as saying.<br /> Asiri said two Egyptian pilots have carried out a number of air sorties, and the Egyptian navy has taken part actively. “If peace talks in Kuwait fail, we would storm the capital Sanaa and fight the final battle in Yemen.”<br /> He said the American attack on Iraq was of a different nature, but the presence of coalition forces in Yemen is an effort to rescue Yemeni citizens. It is not an attack, and there is no lust for any resources of the country, he said.<br /> “We are using guided munitions. One bomb costs 120,000 sterling pounds to reach to precise target,” said the general.</p><p><a href="http://www.arabnews.com/news/we-know-where-saleh-sleeps-yemen-asiri">http://www.arabnews.com/news/we-know-where-saleh-sleeps-yemen-asiri</a></p><p>Comment: Looking serious at Asiris propaganda, things can be so clear: ““We are using guided munitions. One bomb costs 120,000 sterling pounds to reach to precise target,”. What is hit in most cases? Civilians and civilian infrastructure. What is what the Saudis want to hit? Civilians and civilian infrastructure.</p><p>Comment by Judith Brown: Well I happen to think that media management is extremely important - I even did a PhD looking at Arab Imagery in the British Media after working in Lebanon and Yemen because I felt that politicians and the media had deceived me. I guess I am very sceptical of the statements of Asisi as well. But in some parts of the world and amongst some populations he is the one who is believed, not the people of Yemen whose voices are not heard.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154347651323641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154347651323641</a></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cp16 Saudische Luftangriffe / Saudi air raids</strong></span></h2><p>12.5.2016 – New Yemen TV (A K PH)</p><p>The Saudi warplane breach the ceasefire agreement in all Yemeni provinces</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg9MRmHmHTQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg9MRmHmHTQ</a></p><p>12.5.2016 – Iran Daily (A K PH)</p><p>Saudi warplanes kill 2, wound several in Yemen’s Amran</p><p>Saudi warplanes have carried out fresh airstrikes on the northwestern province of Amran, killing and wounding more Yemeni people despite international warnings about deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the war-hit country.</p><p>In their latest aerial aggression on Wednesday, Saudi jets killed at least two civilians and injured nine others in Jebel al-Aswad area in the Harf Sufyan district of the province, Yemen's official Saba Net news agency reported, according to presstv.ir.</p><p>Meanwhile, Saudi troops targeted different areas in the west-central Ma'rib province with rockets and artillery shells.
