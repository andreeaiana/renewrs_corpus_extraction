This will also provide insight into the spillover of the conflict into the Gulf countries. </p><p>The first entry will detail the Houthi ballistic and cruise missile campaign against Saudi Arabia and its allies. The second will look at Houthi drone strikes and the implications therein, while the third will detail the Houthi naval attacks in the Red Sea.</p><p>While the Saudi-led coalition <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/yemen">is certainly not blameless for its role in the violence in Yemen</a>, the data shows that the Houthis have also deliberately targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure in this conflict.</p><p>The spillover into neighboring countries stands to exacerbate the conflict and perpetuate the cycle of violence that will leave many more people dead.</p><p>This is an important nuance to help better the understanding of the conflict in Yemen.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>Data for this project was manually collected from both English and Arabic-language resources ranging from state-run news services in the Gulf to the archives of several regional news outlets. Social media posts, such as on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, were also analyzed.</p><p>Wire news services, such as Reuters, were used in the data collection for additional sourcing. Smaller regional outlets, mainly Yemeni news sites, were also consulted.</p><p>Houthi-ran media and allied sources, such as Lebanese Hezbollah’s Al Manar or Iran’s Fars News, were sometimes used, often with the noted caveat that the Saudi-led coalition did not confirm those instances.</p><p><em>FDD’s Long War Journal</em> has been able to find information on 255 ballistic missile launches inside Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Two cruise missiles were also recorded as being fired into Saudi territory, while another was purportedly directed at the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>In the vast majority of these cases, either Saudi Arabia or the UAE claimed to have intercepted and destroyed these missiles via missile defense systems. </p><p>It should be <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/mideast-africa/2018/03/26/videos-raise-questions-over-saudi-missile-intercept-claims/">noted that military experts have cast doubt</a> on these interception claims.

Turning Point. Did the Ansar Allah Just Win the Yemeni War?</strong></p><p>The announcement that the UAE is in the process of a large-scale military drawdown in Yemen has been met with rapturous applause by the Ansar Allah’s supporters who believe that this unofficially acknowledges their victory in the conflict, but these celebrations are premature because the vast majority of the country’s territory still remains outside of the armed group’s grasp even if most of its people reside in their region, and the most politically realistic solution to the war entails the institutionalization of the state’s deep divisions via the implementation of a “federal” model that de-facto restores the Old Cold War-era independence of North and South Yemen. </p><p>A Turning Point </p><p>Decision makers the world over are talking about the implications of the <a href="https://menafn.com/1098752544/UAE-Pulls-Most-Forces-From-Yemen-In-Blow-To-Saudis-Report">large-scale military drawdown</a> that the UAE recently announced is presently underway in Yemen, with the prevailing notion being that this unofficially acknowledges the Ansar Allah’s (“Houthis'”) victory in the conflict. It’s true that this development is very significant for the armed group because it all but precludes the commencement of any more offensives against the territory under its control, which could potentially lead to the stabilization of the front lines and the beginning of a global aid campaign to relieve the suffering that millions of people are experiencing in what has previously been recognized as <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/02/1032811">the world’s worst humanitarian crisis</a>. In fact, the UAE probably wouldn’t have done this had they and their Saudi allies succeeded in taking the strategic Ansar Allah-held port of Hodeidah, the failure of which set into motion the subsequent events that led to its decision to withdraw most of its forces from Yemen.</p><p>The Ansar Allah And The STC</p><p>The Ansar Allah might have begun as a rural peripheral rebellion among the religious minorities of Yemen’s northern mountainous region but it’s since evolved into a much more inclusive movement that convincingly has the trappings of a national liberation one, especially after allying with the Yemeni Army in seeking the expulsion of all foreign forces from the country. By comparison, the “internationally recognized” government of President Hadi enjoys close to no domestic support whatsoever and has basically functioned as little more than an excuse to justify the Saudi-led coalition’s military intervention against the Ansar Allah. The supposed bastion of its support, the southern port of Aden, is more under the control of the Southern Resistance Forces (SRF, the armed wing of the Southern Transitional Council [STC]) that <a href="https://eurasiafuture.com/2018/01/30/welcome-back-map-south-yemen/">want to restore</a> the Old Cold War-era <a href="https://orientalreview.org/2017/12/08/south-yemen-will-regain-independence-follows-six-steps/">independence of South Yemen</a> than it is Hadi’s, which in and of itself hints at <a href="https://orientalreview.org/2018/02/05/hadis-fall-rise-south-yemen-end-war/">the most politically realistic outcome</a> of this conflict in the wake of the UAE’s withdrawal.</p><p>“Federalization”</p><p>With the Ansar Allah in control of the most demographically and economically significant portions of the former nation of North Yemen (officially the “Yemen Arab Republic” from 1962-1990) and the STC wielding UAE-backed sovereignty over South Yemen (officially the “People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen” from 1967-1990), the quickest way to end the war would be to institutionalize Yemen’s already existing military and political divisions via the implementation of a “<a href="https://niiglob.ru/en/publications/articles/591-part-i-identity-federalism-from-e-pluribus-unum-to-e-unum-pluribus.html">federal</a>” model that de-facto recognizes this state of affairs since neither side has the wherewithal to surmount the stalemate that’s set in. That scenario, however, is far from the “victory” that the Ansar Allah originally hoped to achieve even though it satisfies most of what the STC and its Emirati patron want, all of which would nevertheless further complicate Saudi Arabia’s security situation along its southern border if it turns out that the Kingdom doesn’t have anything to show for its costly campaign other than the Ansar Allah’s “autonomy” over North Yemen and its “little brother’s” (UAE) new proxy state in the south.</p><p>Concluding Thoughts</p><p>Bearing in mind all that was touched upon in this analysis, one can say that while every other participant in the war achieved some (Ansar Allah, UAE) or practically all (STC) of its objectives, the Saudis didn’t succeed with anything other than preventing the Ansar Allah’s full takeover of Yemen. The Kingdom’s security situation is worse than when the conflict began and it no longer has any direct influence in its neighbor, instead having to rely on its “little brother” to maintain its presence in parts of South Yemen. Without the UAE doing the “heavy lifting”, it’s all but inevitable that Saudi Arabia will scramble for a “face-saving” exit from the war as well since it’s proven itself unable to alter the dynamics in is favor on its own, especially when most of what it’s been doing is bombing Yemen and never really fighting on the ground and holding territory like its allies have. Even though the Ansar Allah can’t be said to have won the civil-international Yemeni War since it doesn’t control the entire country, it didn’t lose it either, with that ignoble distinction being the Saudis’ alone -by Andrew Korybko</p><p><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/did-ansar-allah-really-just-win-yemeni-war/5685403">https://www.globalresearch.ca/did-ansar-allah-really-just-win-yemeni-war/5685403</a></p><p>My remark: More on this topic, cp2.</p><p><strong>(** B E K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Prohibiting Maintenance of Tanker Off Yemeni Coast, Saudis Risk Explosion and Environmental Disaster</strong></p><p>“We are talking about a huge floating tanker that entered service in Yemen 30 years ago, which contains more than one million tons of oil. If an explosion takes place, many countries, including Saudi Arabia, will be hit with an environmental disaster.”</p><p>Officials in Yemen’s western port city of Hodeida have expressed concern to MintPress that the <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:683733/mmsi:473111194/imo:7376472/vessel:SAFER">deserted Safer FSOvessel</a>, filled with an estimated 1.1 million barrels of crude oil, is vulnerable to an explosion or a leak due to increasing temperature, high humidity, and maintenance failures. They say that ship’s boilers and coolers have been stopped owing to a lack of diesel fuel and the body of the tanker is beginning to suffer from corrosion following multiple failed efforts to unload its cargo of crude oil.</p><p>According to Yemeni officials, if an urgent rescue operation is not launched, the vessel could create an environmental disaster four times greater than the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in history. </p><p>In 2015, when the Saudi-led Coalition military campaign began in Yemen, Saudi Arabia prevented the oil-laden vessel from leaving Hodeida port and forced crew members to abandon it, leaving important maintenance work undone and creating what is essentially a floating time bomb. Since the vessel was abandoned, the Coalition has repeatedly prevented other ships from refueling the tanker with diesel to operate its generators used for cooling and to discharge gas emitted by the crude oil. </p><p>An oil spill in the Red Sea port would potentially destroy marine ecosystems and pose a threat to coastal tourism. Worst of all, officials say, it could leave millions of people in Hodeida district without clean drinking water. Experts at IR Consilium, a consultancy firm focusing on maritime law and security, warned that a spill in the area would force multiple desalination plants surrounding the Red Sea to close, depriving millions of access to drinking water. </p><p>Moreover, an oil spill could also shutter Yemen’s Hodeida port, the gateway for 90 percent of the country’s food, medical and aid supplies, by strangling traffic on one of the world’s main waterways, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. Such a spill would have a tangible impact on the world economy, according to a <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/gaming-out-the-disaster-what-could-go-wrong-with-the-fso-safer">recent report</a> published by the Atlantic Council. The Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis blame each other for failing to reach an agreement over the fate of the tanker. The Houthis want guarantees that the revenue from the oil aboard the tanker — estimated at more than $70 million, as noted above — will go to pay the salaries of Yemen’s public-sector employees and be used to restore power to the province of Hodeida.</p><p>The Coalition wants the revenue to be kept by Coalition countries, much as the oil revenues from Yemen’s southern regions where Saudi Arabia and the UAE are extracting oil from Shabwa, Balahaf and Hadramout and transferring the revenues to the National Bank in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Mark Lowcock, the UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, pointed out that this was additionally frustrating because Houthi authorities had actually contacted the UN in early 2018 requesting assistance with the tanker and promising to facilitate their [UN] work.</p><p>Saudi Coalition countries and their local allies have recently revived the controversy surrounding the Safer FSO, claiming that rescue of the ship justifies a military campaign to seize control of the area and blaming the Houthis for ship’s condition. But according to Houthi officials, appeals to rescue the ship made by both the Houthi-led government in Sana`a and the Safer Company to the Coalition and to the international community have been ignored.</p><p>For their part, officials in Sana`a have repeatedly warned of potential disaster in the Red Sea – by Ahmed AbdulKareem</p><p><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/maintenance-fso-safer-tanker-yemen-saudi-arabia-oil-spill/261112/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/maintenance-fso-safer-tanker-yemen-saudi-arabia-oil-spill/261112/</a> = <a href="https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/a-massive-catastrophe-that-will-impact-the-world-if-this-floating-bomb-explodes/">https://www.yemenpress.org/yemen/a-massive-catastrophe-that-will-impact-the-world-if-this-floating-bomb-explodes/</a></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>Film: UN Humanitarian Chief: WORST EVER Environmental Disaster Looming in Yemen!</p><p>we speak to UN Undersecretary General Sir Mark Lowcock on the Yemen crisis, he discusses the worsening humanitarian situation, the degradation of civilian infrastructure and the looming possibility of the world’s worst environmental crisis ever if the SAFER oil tanker facility explodes or collapses.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4bOTDXoeok">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4bOTDXoeok</a></p><p>and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rttv/going-underground-worst-environmental-disaster-in-world-history-looming-in-yemen">https://soundcloud.com/rttv/going-underground-worst-environmental-disaster-in-world-history-looming-in-yemen</a> = <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/going-underground-worst-environmental-disaster-in-world/id1457821689?i=1000446033957">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/going-underground-worst-environmental-disaster-in-world/id1457821689?i=1000446033957</a> (Audio)</p><p><strong>(** B P T)</strong></p><p><strong>AQAP attacks in south Yemen draw passive response amid coalition war with Houthis</strong></p><p>Northerners are prevented from entering Aden following Al-Qaeda and Houthi attacks in southern region</p><p>A source in Abyan’s Al-Mahfad district whose name was withheld for security reasons, confirmed to Middle East Eye that AQAP had taken advantage of chaos in Aden, where more than 36 people were also killed by a rocket attack on a military parade claimed by Houthi rebels.</p><p>“Al-Qaeda militants are not stupid, and usually they move in organized steps, not randomly. They sent a suicide bomber to attack a police station in Aden and then they stormed a military base in Abyan, as they knew that forces were focused on Aden.”</p><p>The source said that AQAP had suffered no major losses in Al-Mahfad because they had planned well and withdrew at the proper time, just as forces were arriving from Aden.</p><p>AQAP militants are now spread throughout the south of Yemen. Abyan is one of their main strongholds</p><p>The source added: “The military forces are the only defenders in the region, but they have not launched any effective attacks on AQAP in Al-Mahfad for the last four years.</p><p>“AQAP had stopped targeting military bases for about a year, but now they have revived their operations, not because they were attacked, but because they may have their own plans.”</p><p>AQAP usually takes advantage of the Yemen’s lack of security to implement their plans and achieve their goals with the least loss.</p><p>“All of us in Abyan know that AQAP live in the mountains of Al-Mahfad and in other mountains in surrounding districts.</p><p>“We meet them in the markets of the district. They meet soldiers in the market and move around in their own vehicles ,but the Hadi government and the coalition have not dared to attack them.”</p><p>The source said that most of AQAP militants are originally from Abyan and surrounding areas and live in forts in the mountains.</p><p>“I can confirm that both the Hadi government and the Saudi-led coalition have failed to liberate Abyan and other southern provinces from AQAP, and the spread of Al-Qaeda now threatens Aden more than Abyan because AQAP aims to target leaders in high positions rather than civilians in Abyan.”</p><p>The Yemeni government launched several attacks against AQAP in Abyan and other southern provinces before 2015, but since then their forces have been busy fighting the Houthis, while AQAP militants have established themselves in the south.</p><p>Still, pro-coalition forces say their priority must be the battle against the Houthis.</p><p>Still, the reaction of the SBFs has not been to counter-attack the Houthis with missiles, but to ramp up security and try to prevent northern people from entering Aden. They’ve even burnt the goods of some northern street vendors in Aden, accusing them of being spies for the Houthis.</p><p>“When I arrived at the entrance to Aden, I found dozens of buses and cars were stopped by the SBFs, asking them to return Taiz and not allowing them to enter Aden.”</p><p>He sat for three hours under the sun in the desert, then returned to Taiz. “All people who have ID cards from the north were prevented from entering Aden,” he said.</p><p>“The UAE has been destroying Yemen, and it incites southern fighters against civilians of the north. The Emirati flag was waving over the checkpoint that prevented us from entering Aden.</p><p>“There will no solution in Yemen until UAE leaves and we can meet in national reconciliation,” he said.</p><p>Salah Samer, a resident of Aden who is originally from Taiz, told MEE that hundreds of northerners had been arrested and others exiled from Aden in the last two days, while others, like him, are stuck in their houses waiting for the campaign to end.</p><p>He said that the SBFs were losing their popular support in Aden and throughout the whole country.</p><p>Abu Meshal, a field leader with the SBFs in Aden, confirmed that the situation is unstable and “allows the security forces to do whatever they believe will secure Aden”.</p><p>He told MEE: “Many of the northerners in Aden work as spies for the Houthis.

He was known for confronting the legitimate government forces. He was also known as one of the most prominent military leaders supported by the UAE in southern Yemen. <a href="https://www.adennews.net/en/yemen-english-80962">https://www.adennews.net/en/yemen-english-80962</a></p><p>(* B K P)</p><p>Houthis Kill Top UAE-Backed Separatist Yemeni Commander</p><p>Coming just weeks after Abu Dhabi's drawdown from the anti-Houthi fight, the provocative attack could be a pivotal moment for Yemen’s future.</p><p>Abu Yamamah, forty-five at the time of his death, started his career as a southern military officer, fought in the civil war against the north in 1994, and then helped form the nucleus of the southern resistance movement that spearheaded protests in 2007</p><p>As head of the Security Belt Forces, Abu Yamamah technically reported to the Hadi-led central government. But he also attended meetings as a representative of the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks to separate from the Hadi government. </p><p>REACTIONS AND CONSEQUENCES</p><p>In response to Abu Yamamah’s death, the Yemeni government released a statement praising his sacrifice and saying that the solution to the national conflict was liberating Yemeni soil from the Houthis. Specific Yemeni officials also expressed condolences, including Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed, who called the attack “heinous.”</p><p>So far, the STC has been careful in its public statements, releasing a video calling the attack “treacherous” and eulogizing Abu Yamamah and others as “sacrificing their lives for the... independence of the south.” Beyond this, they have asked southerners to “be patient” as they plan an appropriate response. The reaction from certain locals has been swifter. The community near Abu Yamamah’s hometown, for example, appears to have at least temporarily closed a road to the north, a response that is likely to be mitigated by tribal negotiation. Moreover, as is common in Yemen, the family of Abu Yamamah may volunteer to avenge his death, although it is unclear what form that would take.</p><p>Abu Yamamah’s death may have a ripple effect on the greater Yemeni conflict, perhaps even heightening hostilities. </p><p>In addition to potential protests, STC-aligned forces are likely to ramp up their fight against the Houthis along the north-south front in provinces such as Dhale. </p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Indeed, this attack comes just weeks after the UAE announced its drawdown from the military fight against the Houthis and its granting of full support instead for United Nations–led diplomatic efforts to contain the group. Although Houthis regularly target military gatherings in the south, suggesting the UAE military departure was not the catalyst, the killing of one of the UAE’s favored military commanders by the Iran-equipped Houthis will not go unnoticed in Abu Dhabi. In fact, the attack suggests Iran is providing the Houthis with exactly the kinds of capabilities the UAE has long feared – by <em>Elana DeLozier </em></p><p><a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/houthis-kill-top-uae-backed-yemeni-commander">https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/houthis-kill-top-uae-backed-yemeni-commander</a></p><p>(A K P)</p><p>Interior Ministry condemns twin terror attacks in the capital Aden</p><p><a href="http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/01/interior-ministry-condemns-twin-terror-attacks-in-the-capital-aden/">http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/01/interior-ministry-condemns-twin-terror-attacks-in-the-capital-aden/</a></p><p>(A P)</p><p>PM directs Aden authorities to take urgent measures on twin terror blasts</p><p><a href="http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/01/pm-directs-aden-authorities-to-take-urgent-measures-on-twin-terror-blasts/">http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/01/pm-directs-aden-authorities-to-take-urgent-measures-on-twin-terror-blasts/</a></p><p>(A P)</p><p>Government vows to end of Houthis’ coup following Aden twin attacks</p><p>Prime Minister, Maeen Abdulmalik, vowed elimination of the Iran-backed Houthis coup following twin terror attacks on Thursday early morning targeted police and military headquarters in the Aden temporary capital.</p><p><a href="https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-32359">https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-32359</a></p><p><span>(A K P)</span></p><p>President Hadi: Rogue militias cannot seek peace and the entire territory of the homeland must be liberated</p><p>President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi sent a message of condolences in the martyrdom of the commander of the 1st Brigade supported and logistics Brigadier General Munir al-Yafei and a number of his innocent comrades</p><p>"Rogue militias cannot seek peace, so our people must confront their rogue practices and actions to liberate the entire soil of the country from its evils," the president noted.</p><p><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/170234">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/170234</a></p><p>(A P)</p><p>Al-Alimi: All National Forces responsible on failing Houthi, terrorists’ agendas</p><p><a href="http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/01/al-alimi-all-national-forces-responsible-on-failing-houthi-terrorists-agendas/">http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/01/al-alimi-all-national-forces-responsible-on-failing-houthi-terrorists-agendas/</a></p><p>and statements by separatists:</p><p>(* A K P)</p><p>The STC's Statement on Today's Events</p><p>This day the First of August 2019, the capital Aden, was subjected to two treacherous bomb attacks; the first was on the Police station in Sheikh Othman district and the second was at a graduation ceremony at the training camps of the Armed Forces.

Pillar, a retired CIA officer, says the UAE has come to recognize that its military cooperation with the Saudis in war on Yemen has failed to make any achievement.</p><p>Speaking in an exclusive interview with FNA, Pillar, who is now a nonresident senior fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Security Studies, said, “There was no sign that the Houthis were being militarily defeated.”</p><p>Below is the full text of the interview:</p><p><em>Q: Why has the UAE decided to retreat from Yemen? Does this withdrawal mean the Emirates defeat and failure?</em></p><p>A: Quite simply, the UAE recognized that the military intervention in Yemen was not accomplishing anything. There was no sign that the Houthis were being militarily defeated. The wars costs were adding up without comparable results. The Emiratis also no doubt took notice of how the Saudi-led war in Yemen was coming under increasing criticism in the United States. Insofar as Iran, as a backer of the Houthis, is as another factor in the war, the UAE move probably also reflects a judgment that constantly increasing tension with Iran is in no one's interests.</p><p><em>Q: Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have started developing differences over Yemen. What do you think is their most important difference?</em></p><p>A: There are several differences in how the two allies were conducting the war and relating to factions inside Yemen. The Saudis were operating mostly in the air, while the Emiratis had more of a presence on the ground. The UAE has been more closely allied with Southern secessionist elements than the Saudis ever were. But probably the most important difference is that the war is closely identified with Saudi leader Mohammed bin Salman as his personal project, in a way that it never was identified with leaders of the UAE.</p><p><a href="https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980512000980">https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980512000980</a></p><p><span>(* B K P)</span></p><p>Why the United Arab Emirates Is Abandoning Saudi Arabia in Yemen</p><p>With the war in Yemen stalemated, the UAE has started pulling back—leaving its powerful ally holding the bag.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has not been particularly vocal about the withdrawal, but officials in Riyadh are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/world/middleeast/yemen-emirates-saudi-war.html">reported</a> by the <em>New York Times</em> as having “intervened with the Emirati leaders to try to dissuade them from the drawdown.”</p><p>There’s also the problem that the UAE is leaving behind competition and potential conflict between the militias it nurtured in the areas it held. </p><p>Riyadh may have a hard time accommodating the council’s wishes and managing other UAE-supported <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/76876">militias</a>, such as the Security Belt Forces and the Shabwani and Hadrami Elite Forces, all nominally part of the Yemeni army, and the Salafi Amalqa and Abu al-Abbas Brigades. Saudi Arabia’s ostensible reason for intervening in Yemen was restore Hadi to power and to help maintain Yemen’s unity. So recognizing and cooperating with his rivals in the south would undermine Saudi Arabia’s original rationale for the war and harm its credibility.</p><p>These uncomfortable truths beg the question of why the UAE decided to leave in the first place. There are a few possibilities.</p><p>But whatever the exact reasoning behind the UAE’s decision to leave Yemen, one thing is clear: Saudi Arabia is in a bind. It cannot pursue an endless engagement in Yemen without partners with military means like the UAE, and it cannot simply pack up and leave, because that would amount to a strategic defeat that ensconces the Iranian-allied Houthis in northern Yemen.</p><p>It is thus not hard to imagine Saudi Arabia rethinking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/world/middleeast/crown-prince-mohammed-bin-zayed.html">its relationship</a> with its smaller neighbor, which would be detrimental to UAE’s interests.

Even the UAE – Saudi Arabia’s closest ally – pronounced on 22 July: “There was no easy victory and there will be no easy peace.”</p><p>Let’s start with the downside. What has been lost and the scale of the disaster here is quite staggering.</p><p>The Yemen war, now in its fifth year, has rightly been branded the worst humanitarian crisis of our time.

Over the last five years or so in that critical but chaotic part of the world, the United States has repeatedly witnessed the limitations of using the blunt instrument of American military force to win that complicated political, social, economic and religious conflict. There is, of course, no better example of this failure to understand the limits of American military power than its disastrous invasion and occupation of Iraq as well. And yet it is now back to making the same mistake, this time in Yemen.</p><p>The United States is failing in Yemen (and the entire Middle East, for that matter) ethically and strategically. America is complicit in the collapse of an impoverished, failed state that has spread the anti-American spirit all over the Middle-East. The US role in Yemen counts not only because millions may die, but because it matters how Americans are viewed in the world. The Yemen war has brought Riyadh and Washington mere defeat and failure and filled the world with hate for the Saudis and their American backers. Even if one is loath to discuss morals or human rights, consider it this way: Withdrawing support from Saudi aggression could save millions of civilian lives.</p><p><a href="https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980510000888">https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980510000888</a></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p><span>Ac</span>tivists protest international silence towards Houthis’ crimes</p><p>Yemeni social media activists and civil society organizations began on Friday 2 August a protest campaign on social media sites against international silence towards crimes carried out by the Houthis militants against civilians.</p><p>The campaign which is named “week of silence” is intended to expose indifference and silence by international powers and organizations towards atrocious crimes carried out by the Houthis-affiliated militants. </p><p><a href="https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-32391">https://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-32391</a></p><p>and</p><p>(A P)</p><p><span>Statement of Condemnation of the crimes of Al-Houthi militias attacking civilians, mostly <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/children?src=hashtag_click">#children</a> civil society organizations, condemn the horrific crimes, atrocities, &amp; acts of violence committed against civilians in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hashtag_click">#Yemen</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Houthi?src=hashtag_click">#Houthi</a> militia.</span></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ycmhrv/status/1157581762689736706">https://twitter.com/ycmhrv/status/1157581762689736706</a></p><p>(* B P)</p><p>A Feminist Peace Process: Yemen’s Future Is in Women’s Hands</p><p>It is not new that while armed conflicts impact women disproportionately, they remain massively under-represented in the attempts to bring the conflict to a close.

While much of the former police leadership remained in place, the rank and file had to be rebuilt after the relative reestablishment of stability.</p><p>Informal actors, in particular sheikhs and aqils, expanded their roles as security providers. After the state framework collapsed, the degree of arbitrariness in security provision increased. Today, security structures overlap in their functioning, without clear hierarchies.</p><p>Informal actors have become security actors as well as security threats. While these actors mediate in conflicts and manage public security, some are at the same time involved in armed clashes and criminal activity.</p><p>Over the course of 2017, formal institutions gradually began to function again in southwestern Taiz city through the internationally recognized government. When asked in 2017 which actor is usually the first to respond to security incidents, a plurality of 37 percent of respondents in resistance-controlled areas said the police/security authorities.</p><p>Although overall confidence in the police increased between 2017 and 2019, Taiz residents are disappointed with the performance of the police, with a 2019 survey recording a 40 percent increase in the number of respondents who said that the police are not active in their area.</p><p>Cooperation between formal and informal actors is characterized on the one hand by the state’s efforts to gain control over all security services and reestablish an order of command, but on the other hand, many actors base their preferences for coordination on political loyalties.</p><p>Police in Taiz lack training, uniforms and basic equipment, including vehicles, computers, phones, weapons and armor.</p><p>Non-state actors, the sheikhs and aqils, lack knowledge of basic administrative processes, resulting in a situation that hampers coordination with state institutions and encourages cooperation with actors based on political or personal loyalty.</p><p><a href="http://www.yemenpolling.org/formalizing_the_informal/">http://www.yemenpolling.org/formalizing_the_informal/</a></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Yemeni PM: We Have No Contacts with STC, We Appreciate Sacrifices</p><p>Yemeni Prime Minister Dr. Moeen Abdul Malik said there were no contacts between his government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC), but stressed that he was seeking to improve the political environment through democratic practices.<br /> In an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat, Abdul Malik said he appreciated the role assumed by a number of STC leaders and the forces of the southern and national resistance in defeating Houthi militias.“We are open to all forces and realize the importance of aligning them in the face of the Iranian project in Yemen, in order to reach understandings to maintain the country’s integrity and respect for the laws,” he noted.</p><p><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1839096/yemeni-pm-we-have-no-contacts-stc-we-appreciate-sacrifices">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1839096/yemeni-pm-we-have-no-contacts-stc-we-appreciate-sacrifices</a></p><p><span>(* B T)</span></p><p>A crime in a mosque.

These were joined by the Ministry of Culture created in 2018, which itself will launch 11 specialized agencies encompassing music, museums, and performance arts. Saudi Arabia has also integrated previously independent organizations and individuals into the government structure and utilized a quasi-government model (operating between the private and government sectors) to further the entertainment agenda.
