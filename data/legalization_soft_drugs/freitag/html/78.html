This percentage was 34% of the population in 2006 according to World Bank indicators.</p><p>The human rights situation in Yemen has become very sensitive and complex. The fifth year of armed conflict has been marked by bloody, violent and horrendous violence against civilians as the case was in the past four years as addressed in this report. Violations associated with this conflict led to a serious deterioration of the humanitarian and economic status of the population to the extent that the countries of the world and its humanitarian organizations are warning of a humanitarian disaster affecting Yemenis. The signs of the disaster are evident in the high rates of malnutrition, especially among children and women, as well as the spread of diseases Yemenis have forgotten such as cholera, diphtheria and dengue fever and other illnesses that reemerged during the war.</p><p>This report covers the period from 21 September 2014 to 31 December 2018. The state institutions protecting human rights have vanished after the fall of the capital Sana’a. It should be noted that the report contains the most prominent violations and crimes that occurred during the period it covers. It shall be admitted that this report, or any other human rights report or organization, can not list all violations committed in Yemen given the intensity, diversity and sheer size of these violations. In terms of perpetrates, this report mentions the most prominent actors of them. It is a fact that under each conflict party, there are affiliated groups, entities and individuals that have not been named with few exceptions.</p><p>During the reporting period, all partiesto the conflictcommittedwidespread violations of International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law. The extent of violations varied from one party to another. There were crimes that violated International Humanitarian Law with regard to deprivation of life, such as bombing, indiscriminate attacks, the air strikes by Arab Coalition forces, the US drone attacks, as well as the killing by snipers and guided weapons and killings due to clashes between the parties to the conflict. This is in addition to the death and injury caused by mines. Crimes violating International Human Rights Law, such as the deprivation of the right to life including extrajudicial executions, death under torture, different forms of assassinations and suicide attacks were also committed. The report also focuses on violations of human dignity such as detention, enforced disappearance, torture and conditions of prisons operated by the parties to the conflict. The report also tackles violations against journalists, activists, human rights defenders, politicians and members of minorities including Baha’is, Jews and Christians, as well as attacks on the media and civil society organizations. The report also documents the siege imposed on the city of Taiz, and the closure of the seaports and airspace of Yemen.</p><p><span><a href="http://ycmhrv.co/Home/MonthlyReport/RGyLz9ch/HRStuation-in-Y-English">http://ycmhrv.co/Home/MonthlyReport/RGyLz9ch/HRStuation-in-Y-English</a></span></p><p>My comment: As this organization is a loyalist to “president” Hadi, this report is very detailed, but it is biased.</p><p><strong>(** B P)</strong></p><p><strong>Understanding the Houthi Faction in Yemen</strong></p><p>One of the most misunderstood and most central parties to the conflict is the Houthis. In the past decade, they have grown in power from an isolated religious movement into a considerable militant faction that controls the Yemeni capital, Sana’a. However, with this success have come new internal divisions and external threats that will influence how the devastating war will end and what might follow.</p><p>The Rise of the Houthis</p><p>Who Is a “Houthi” in This Conflict?</p><p>The Houthis, who prefer the term Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), are generally defined as followers of Abdel Malik and Hussein al-Houthi’s religious and political agenda and the adherents of the philosophy inspired by Badr al-Din al-Houthi.</p><p>Authority resides in the “Sa’dah Core,” who survived the Sa’dah wars and <span><a href="https://arabic.cnn.com/middleeast/2015/03/26/houthi-introduction">whose ideologies lean closer to Twelver Shi’ism</a></span>, which is practiced in Iran but historically alien to Yemen.</p><p>Authority resides in the “Sa’dah Core,” who survived the Sa’dah wars and <span><a href="https://arabic.cnn.com/middleeast/2015/03/26/houthi-introduction">whose ideologies lean closer to Twelver Shi’ism</a></span>, which is practiced in Iran but historically alien to Yemen.</p><p>Another faction are the Houthi jihadis, who constitute the majority of the Houthis’ fighters in the war and who are motivated by a radical religious interpretation analogous to Salafi jihadis. They are inspired by the Sa’dah Core and the historical references to the martyrdom of Hussein</p><p>Additionally, there are the Zaydi dogmatists</p><p>In addition to the ideological division, the Houthis are also riven by geographic divides that are dictated by <span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/1597712/The_Contemporary_Structures_and_Historical_Formation_of_the_Khawl%C4%81n_and_Jum%C4%81%CA%BFah_Tribes_in_%E1%B9%A2a%CA%BFdah_Northwest_Yemen_2014_">existing tribal groupings</a></span>.</p><p>Failed Political Mobilization</p><p>The Houthis have failed to mobilize politically as they have militarily. After their initial success sweeping into Sana’a, a number of political parties sided with the Houthis, including the Union of Popular Forces and al-Haq Party, but their motives were complicated—while they were influenced by the legitimacy of the Houthis’ Zaydi identity, they also had to consider their own viability and safety under Houthi rule.</p><p>Many Houthi supporters are politically or religiously agnostic pragmatists whose support for the group is based on immediate interests.</p><p>The infighting between the Houthi and pro-Saleh factions reinforced perceptions that the conflict is primarily between Saudi and Iranian proxies, and after Saleh was killed outside Sana’a some pragmatists proclaimed <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.net/news/reportsandinterviews/2017/12/5/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AA-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9">their dissent and fled Houthi-controlled territory</a></span>. </p><p>The most influential component of the Houthi group is its militant bloc, represented by the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, which is structured similarly to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. The Houthi military bloc is formidably armed, including with weapons <a href="https://warisboring.com/how-did-the-houthis-manage-to-lob-a-ballistic-missile-at-mecca/">it seized from government forces in the north</a>.</p><p>The Houthi military wing provides the only significant female representation within the organization.</p><p>The Houthis are waging battles on many fronts, including internally.</p><p>The military branch of the Houthi movement could easily take advantage of its powerful wartime role to crush its rivals in the political arm. Doing so, however, would hinder the possibility of reconciliation with other Yemeni groups postwar and would complicate the possibility of peace. </p><p>Iran’s Role in the Conflict</p><p>Yemen’s war is a gift to Iran; Iran’s quiet manipulation of the war has reinforced its opponents’ fears that it is a menacing power in the Arabian Peninsula.</p><p>The Houthis’ and Yemen’s Future</p><p>If the Houthis fail to uphold their end of the peace bargain, the United Nations and other peace brokers should pressure the Houthis with exclusion in postconflict arrangements or the peace-building process—especially if the other political and military factions in Yemen can agree. But this should be a last resort. The Houthis are a powerful faction, and even if they have struggled to govern the country, they have demonstrated the capacity to stoke conflict and spoil political cooperation.

Some of them wait for treatment by lying on cardboard under trees, with IVs dangling from the branches.</p><p>“We receive cases around the clock. Sometimes three to four cases a minute,” said Dr. Ismail al-Mansouri. “The hospital is under heavy pressure, as it receives patients from across the country.”</p><p>Even the doctors are not immune: Al-Mansouri and several other staff have caught cholera. On March 28, one of their colleagues, a well-loved pediatrician, died of the disease.</p><p>Two other outbreaks since 2016 caused more than 1.4 million suspected cases and killed more than 3,000 people. Most of those stemmed from an outbreak that began in April 2017 and grew into the world’s biggest.</p><p>The spread has slowed since late 2018, although it never stopped. Now, seasonal rains that began earlier than usual this year have caused a spike in the disease.</p><p>There were 76,152 new suspected cases and 195 deaths in March, compared to about 32,000 cases in February and 39,000 in January. The March toll brought the number of those believed to have died from cholera this year to nearly 300.</p><p>The rates last month are comparable to the first weeks of 2017, when cases jumped to 10,000 and 20,000 a week. It accelerated to 50,000 a week at its height and went on to infect more than 1 million people before waning in mid-2018.</p><p>“The outbreak this year is much worse and the situation is very dangerous,” said Adel al-Alamni, head of the cholera treatment center at al-Sabeen.</p><p>The destruction wreaked by Yemen’s civil war has created prime conditions for cholera’s spread – by Ahmed Al-Haj, AP</p><p><span><a href="https://apnews.com/ad3e0e7b03884c89bd16aaa9c3c836d7">https://apnews.com/ad3e0e7b03884c89bd16aaa9c3c836d7</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/cholera-is-surging-once-again-in-war-ravaged-yemen/2019/04/04/cc5db698-56fe-11e9-aa83-504f086bf5d6_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/cholera-is-surging-once-again-in-war-ravaged-yemen/2019/04/04/cc5db698-56fe-11e9-aa83-504f086bf5d6_story.html</a></span> = <span><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/05/new-cholera-outbreak-in-war-ravaged-yemen-could-be-the-worst-yet/">https://nypost.com/2019/04/05/new-cholera-outbreak-in-war-ravaged-yemen-could-be-the-worst-yet/</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span>Film: </span>Yemen's cholera outbreak kills over 300 people</p><p>The war has damaged the country's infrastructure, making conditions ripe for contamination.</p><p>Cholera is making another comeback in <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/yemen.html">Yemen</a></span>.</p><p>Suspected cases have doubled during the past month, with warm, wet weather, and a healthcare system that has been devastated by war, creating perfect conditions for the illness to spread.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/yemens-cholera-outbreak-kills-300-people-190406101635126.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/yemens-cholera-outbreak-kills-300-people-190406101635126.html</a></span> = <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pkDCT6kE7E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pkDCT6kE7E</a></span></p><p>(* B H)</p><p>Yemen’s Worsening Cholera Outbreak</p><p>Like the rest of Yemen’s humanitarian crisis, the latest outbreak of cholera is the result of the destruction and upheaval caused by the war.

To do this, the local security force issue – which has as much to do with longer-term matters of sovereignty and legitimacy as with control of Hodeida itself – may have to be fully postponed and settled during discussions over a wider transitional arrangement.

It’s interesting up to which degree the UAE – the main supporters of Yemeni separatists – take their part in this matter. The whole matter shows that the UAE are those who really have the power at Aden, the Hadi “government” just being without any power in their own “capital city”.

Any future political settlement will have to include a mechanism to end the struggle for Taiz, but internal wrangling among anti-Huthi forces may prove as much of a barrier to progress as their rivalry with the Huthis.</p><p>Internal tensions among the loose coalition of anti-Huthi forces inside the city continue to pose an additional obstacle to improving life.</p><p>Along with other major front lines in the broader conflict, an accord on Taiz city and the wider eponymous governorate will be a key component of any political settlement to end the war, not least because so many of Yemen’s warring factions and parties are present there. Taiz was discussed during UN-led talks between the Huthis and government of Yemen in December 2018. But with most energy in Sweden directed at brokering a deal on Hodeida, the parties made no substantive agreement beyond committing to create a new committee to discuss the status of the city.</p><p>Opening the Taiz-Aden Highway</p><p>UN officials say that this has led to constructive discussions that are now centred around reopening the main highway linking Taiz with Aden, currently cut off by fighting. Doing so would allow for huge improvements to daily life in Taiz</p><p>Bottom Line: Yemen’s war is complex and multifaceted, as Taiz demonstrates. De-escalating the conflict in the city and wider governorate requires the UN and other international players not only to reach an agreement between the Huthis and their adversaries, but also to achieve a compromise within the anti-Huthi front,</p><p><span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/crisis-group-yemen-update-8">https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/crisis-group-yemen-update-8</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>Emirati exploitation of humanitarian aid in Yemen.

The task of fighting and bombing has been carried out by locals, America’s Gulf allies, and others paid by the coalition for their labors.</p><p>But however indirectly the U.S. might be culpable for the calamity befalling Yemen, it is culpable nonetheless. The roots of the country’s failure go deep: from Sanaa’s repeated neglect of Houthi and southern grievances, to Yemeni elites’ betrayal of the promises of the 2011 uprising, to President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi’s ineffective and corrupt governance before the war, to the Houthis’ toppling of the government in late 2014 and subsequent conquest of the rest of the country, and finally to the Saudi-led coalition’s reaction to that move in the aftermath. At so many of these turns, the U.S. arguably mishandled its response. From the outset, it focused on the fight against al-Qaeda. That blurred its vision of Hadi’s failings and helped it miss the fact that, however obliging a counterterrorism partner he might have been, he widely was perceived by Yemenis as having let them down as their nation’s leader. But at none of those turns was the price ultimately to be paid higher than in the American decision to support the coalition’s battle.</p><p><span>W</span>hy the U.S. got entangled in this war—and why a president so determined to keep the country out of another Mideast military mess nonetheless got caught in this one—makes for a painful story.</p><p>The question today is less how the U.S. got into this mess than how it can end this war even if the coalition’s original ambitions (militarily defeating the Houthis, eliminating all Iranian influence in the country) will not be achieved.</p><p>The United States is left with painful questions: What would have happened if it had rejected the Saudis’ original pleas, or set tighter limits on its support, or exerted earlier and more meaningful pressure on its partners?

From St. Augustine in his <span><a href="https://archive.org/stream/lettersofstaugus00sparuoft/lettersofstaugus00sparuoft_djvu.txt">letters</a></span> to U.S. President Barack Obama <span><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2009/obama/26183-nobel-lecture-2009/">in his Nobel Lecture</a></span>, scholars and political leaders have grappled with the same dilemma: War is awful but sometimes necessary. Just war theory helps to establish when: The decision to go to war must come from the right intention, come from the right authority, and be a last resort.</p><p>These criteria provide an important framework for containing the worst excesses of war, but as the proxy commitments of the Soviet Union and later Russia, Iran, and the United States have shown, they are incomplete. Proxy conflicts, as the war in Yemen reveals, introduce complications that just war theory does not consider.</p><p>Much of this comes from a single flawed assumption: that if a proxy’s cause is just, then a benefactor’s support for them must be just. This ignores a reality now borne out by six decades of U.S. involvement in proxy conflict. The moment the United States has intervened on a proxy’s behalf, whether in Vietnam, Afghanistan, or Yemen, this has immediately changed a proxy’s thinking. Once a proxy has a benefactor’s support, they have greater incentive to escalate a conflict rather than resolve it. A proxy has greater resources, and greater reason, to forgo risks around the negotiating table and pursue them on the battlefield.</p><p>This is one reason why intervention in a proxy war like Yemen’s often deepens the very conflict it is intended to resolve.</p><p>Much of this comes from a single flawed assumption: that if a proxy’s cause is just, then a benefactor’s support for them must be just.

IS’ persistence creates a complicated and challenging dynamic in Yemen. First, and most obviously, its mere existence presents another jihadist group for local and international actors to confront. Second, its operations have already, and will likely continue to, have a multifaceted effect on al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).</p><p>Over the past year, IS-Y and AQAP’s operations have mostly consisted of tit-for-tat attacks against one another in the Qayfa region of al-Bayda.

Both are unidentified. One missile targeted Khamis Mushait, and was successfully intercepted. The second targeted a pro-coalition military base in Al Khokha in southern Hodeidah, Yemen. It was not intercepted and resulted in casualties.</p><p>There has been a significant decrease in reported missile activity over the past three months. There are several potentials reasons for this. One is that Houthis are substituting ballistic missiles for drones. During this three-month period, reporting on Houthi UAV forces and deployment has increased. A second reason behind decreasing reported missile activity is that Saudi Arabia may have cut reporting on its Yemen operations following considerable public scrutiny of the conflict that came with the Jamal Khashoggi killing. Other potential explanations include diplomatic efforts promoting strict ceasefires, and Houthis forces running low on ballistic missiles, potentially due to decreasing missile supplies coming from Iran.</p><p>Below is a summary of the confirmed missile and UAV events during the January 10 to April 3 period.</p><p><span><a href="https://missilethreat.csis.org/yemen-update-january-10-april-3/">https://missilethreat.csis.org/yemen-update-january-10-april-3/</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp18 Sonstiges / Other</span></h2><p>(-)</p><p>Film: Dieses Video zeigt die Schönheit und die Vielfalt des Jemen</p><p>Film: Just to remind everyone of the beauty and diversity of <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/yemen?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBkeys6YqwEQbexio_Pfz6tm3SU0K2bFttH1vBa_JVI9DEwT0k5f1hgC-S3HDNYHbUPaNTqEzK37h8V-Qae7WY0Des19OtqMgzNtttrBClzHFoqDR7TFx3YP_jics3nXGY8lBpuCATRK3fply5qrTTgViXdyRa3FMLF7J4z02rnVIpDwOAQ8xnRmw3xt-pr6xpVK4qZzTVcxxwH4ngDph8S0OP4c7rfXUj91kudhu-sm3KqPI6ZXYzrypOM5mS72L1yaH9seq4nqVT3JQazP9pi9AC04Xi3LhJQ8-I5EPDNzM5PLD8CJsk4P5Ses0CGDk-mzxkGg6hElFiDZ5dvEgSwZW0AhwCyobkE53o00yA5irv0xnFJKXb5-W2vqE_NWoDHfzWzi7R4HKjV2BPbQYZoHYP1s2HthhkqyCLECUxLJRXx9bqguXXIDO-oUsv1X5MEOeFdHmXO-81c4BMk7N0WR6eBroJ_nakFNIwNe5CShMy9VzmtPlEWw-2wMvu1lw&amp;__tn__=%2ANK-R">#Yemen</a></span>, a nation which has stayed true to its origins.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=279411682986020">https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=279411682986020</a></span></p><p>(-)</p><p>Film: Despite the pain that we are in <span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a></span> passing through but still there place for fun, I have seen this today in Sana'a boys are dancing perfectly, Performing Yemeni tribal dance In the street some kind of wedding.</p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/MohammedHojily/status/1113922753353138177">https://twitter.com/MohammedHojily/status/1113922753353138177</a></span></p><p>(-)</p><p>Map: Over a decade ago, FoS produced a map of the Soqotra Archipelago with the main village names transcribed by Dr Miranda Morris from Soqotri.
