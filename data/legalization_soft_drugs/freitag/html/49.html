More than 4.4 million people live in hard to reach areas, including almost 2,2 million children. 80 percent of these areas face crippling food shortages (IPC4)[3], which is one step away from famine. By comparison, half of the accessible districts face that level of food insecurity.</p><p>A further 121 000 [4] children under five in these hard to reach areas are already moderately malnourished, and are at risk of sliding into severe malnourishment. Children in these areas are much less likely to receive life-saving goods like medicines and therapeutic foods with only 35 [5] percent of these children having received the support they needed by September 2019.</p><p>Some four and a half years after the conflict in Yemen escalated, parts of these hard to reach districts are almost entirely cut off from receiving humanitarian support. The inconsistent and delayed delivery of aid supplies has meant children in these areas are bearing the brunt of a brutal hunger crisis.</p><p>Persistent and ongoing efforts by aid agencies to provide assistance has made a difference but the raging conflict and increasing challenges with access continue to worsen the plight of families in the hardest to reach areas in Hodeidah, Hajjah, Taiz and Sa’ada Governorates. In addition to infrastructural damage to bridges, roads and health facilities, bureaucratic impediments are limiting children’s access to nutritious food, health care and clean water - services vital for their survival.</p><p>An ongoing fuel crisis in northern Yemen is further adding to the challenges of delivering supplies to health and other facilities in hard to reach areas across the country. This creates a knock on effect of higher food prices and a worsening health crisis. The decreased access to clean water raises the risk of a spike in cholera and other waterborne diseases.</p><p>According to Save the Children, without an end to the conflict across the country, it will become increasingly difficult to reach more children in many areas made inaccessible by the fighting.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.savethechildren.net/news/hunger-crisis-set-hit-thousands-yemeni-children-living-areas-cut-aid-supplies">https://www.savethechildren.net/news/hunger-crisis-set-hit-thousands-yemeni-children-living-areas-cut-aid-supplies</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><strong>(** B H K)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemeni children suffer under Saudi siege</strong></p><p><span>Tens of thousands of children under immediate threat by war and blockade</span></p><p><span>During five years of aggression against Yemen, the children lived a bitter life between injuries, disabilities, famine and death, physical diseases and the same deadly epidemics, violations, attacks, displacement, denial of education, in addition to direct killing by all available means.</span></p><p>The aggression machine has been able to claim the lives of thousands of children directly or indirectly. Also, the blockade and destroying medical infrastructure have helped to spread epidemics alarmingly. The missiles hit various parts of Yemen, destroyed hundreds of schools, making the children away from them, and destroyed homes. Many citizens took what has been lift of the schools as displaced shelters.</p><p>Everywhere</p><p>Since March 2015 to November 2019, more than 3,809 children have been killed and more than 4,035 injured. An average of five children killed a day,” Inseqam Al-Sharif, director of the Civil Bloc for Development and Freedoms told al-Thawra Newspaper.</p><p>According to al-Sharif, “the number of children and women severely malnourished is 3.2 million, approximately 7.4 million Yemeni children are in dare need of humanitarian and health assistance, and more than half of Yemen’s children do not have access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.”</p><p>“2.1 million children under the age of five are malnourished. 400,000 are severely malnourished, including one child dies every 10 minutes. In Yemen 1.2 million married women are malnourished that have a negative impact on their health and the fetus’s health during pregnancy and after childbirth,” said Dr. Yousef Al-Hadari, spokesman for the Ministry of Health.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, about 80,000 children under the age of five die each year in Yemen as a result of acute malnutrition.”</p><p>The aggression by destroying the infrastructure of the health sector and removing it from its scope has made Yemen a breeding ground for the spread of epidemics.</p><p>Moving the central bank to Aden, the blockade associated with the aggression and the closure of Sana’a International Airport, double the suffering of citizens and prevented 200,000 patients from travelling for treatment abroad, 30 per cent are children. 10,000 children died, according to al-Hadari.</p><p>UN And Official Figures</p><p>According to UNICEF, WHO and WFP figures, “1 million Yemeni children are at risk of being infected with diphtheria, which is spreading at a rapid rate in the country, which is also suffering from the widespread of cholera.</p><p>“More than 100,000 cases of cholera have been recorded in Yemen since the beginning of 2019, most of them are under the age of 15,” save the children said. While the number of cholera victims of children during the period of aggression in Yemen was around 1,000 and 500,000, according to official estimates.</p><p>In 2015, more than 10,000 children died of preventable diseases due to the low health system, according to previous UNICEF reports, which also indicated similar declines in the following years.</p><p>Psychiatric illness</p><p>The health tragedy of Yemeni children is not limited to the aggression, but the explosions caused by the bombing have caused psychological damage to a wide range of children.</p><p>“The United Nations has estimated that 90,000 children are suffering from psychological problems,” al-Hadari said.</p><p>A survey published in 2018, conducted on nearly 1,000 children in Sana’a alone, found that “79 percent of them showed signs of serious psychological consequences.” The study reveals that “in the first year of aggression, family members began Note the involuntary urination of children, and their refusal to be alone or do not want to leave the house, as stated in a working paper for Yemeni activists on “the suffering of children in the war on Yemen” during the seminar on (message of Yemeni children from the rubble) held in Sana’a on September 1, 2019.</p><p>Save the Children organization said it had evidence of what experts called “toxic stress,” the most serious form of stress that a child can experience, caused by strong, repeated or prolonged adversity without adequate care.</p><p>In areas that have been bombed, children face: bedwetting, nightmares, alertness, sadness, depression, anxiety, aggression, feelings of withdrawal and many other challenges, psychological indicators that experts say will weaken their ability to engage in daily life, including an inability to concentrate or perform well in School, learning new information, forming relationships and attachments, or creating a sense of security, ”said Talat al-Shargabi, a spokesman for the Ministry of Human Rights.</p><p>Displacement</p><p>Al-Shargabi told Al-Thawra: “The aggression displaced about 1.5 children from their homes to refugee camps with poor living and climatic environment. Displacement has contributed to: high malnutrition, widespread epidemics due to water scarcity and poor hygiene, many children dying as a result of cold, lack of medical camps or treatment; thousands of displaced students are denied basic and secondary education; This has negatively affected the lives of children, the rise of begging among displaced children and many of them with serious skin diseases.</p><p>Employment and Early Marriage</p><p>Education Targeting</p><p>Child Recruitment</p><p>Targeting Their Future</p><p><span><a href="https://www.uprising.today/yemeni-children-suffer-under-saudi-siege/">https://www.uprising.today/yemeni-children-suffer-under-saudi-siege/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Detainees Stuck Between the Darkness of Prisons and Death Coming from the Sky</strong></p><p>Detainees and people forcibly disappeared by the conflicting parties in Yemen are subjected to different kinds of violations. In the darkness of the prisons where they languish, nothing helps them persevere except for the hope of emancipation and liberation. Then, suddenly, this hope might be taken away from them, and they find themselves in a direct confrontation with death coming from the sky, a death that they confront while their ankles are shackled and they do not have the ability to escape and survive.</p><p>This is what actually happened on the night of Saturday, August 31<sup>, </sup>2019, at about 11:45 pm, Sana’a time, when Saudi/UAE-led coalition fighter jets dropped bombs on an Ansar Allah (Houthis) detention center at the northern end of Dhamar (south of the capital Sana’a), where approximately 170 detainees were held and crammed into a small two-story building, killing most of them. Dhamar Community College had been turned into a place of detention since 2015.</p><p>That night, the air strike killed at least 96 people, including seven children and wounded at least 40 people. Their bodies were torn to shreds that covered the whole courtyard of the Community College and their blood was mixed with the cement and stones. This horrific attack was an additional testimony to the high cost paid by Yemenis protected by international humanitarian law in this armed conflict.</p><p><span>The next morning, I was participating in a Mwatana mission to visit the site of the bloody attack. I inspected the destruction of the Dhamar Community College buildings that were transformed by the Ansar Allah armed group (Houthis) into a place of detention. I saw horrifying, heart-wrenching scenes, bodies shredded and scattered throughout the college yard, while the Yemen Red Crescent Society was trying hard to assemble body parts in plastic bags.</span></p><p><span>While I was trying to move through the rubble, I went behind the targeted building to see a cell that was partially destroyed, and I wish I hadn’t gone. It was a room full of torn bodies, and in one corner of the cell where the fire was set ablaze, some bodies were burned and a strong grilling smell made me dizzy. The scene immensely pained me and an inner, slow and suffocated whimper came out of me due to the horror of what I saw.</span></p><p><span>At Dhamar General Hospital, I was looking carefully at a 19-year-old survivor sitting on a bed whose face looked reassured and comforted, as though he had escaped death forever. I spoke to him and he told me: “I felt the wall of the building shake when the first rocket hit. We all gathered at the cell gate, begging them to open the door and then suddenly, I felt nothing. Later, I woke up to the sound feet and voices looking for survivors. I yelled at the top of my lungs that I am here but they couldn’t determine my location. So I told them I was stuck under somebody’s feet.”</span></p><p><span>This was not the only horrific attack. In 2015, the Dhamar Community College was hit by an air strike, along with several attacks on other detention centers launched by the coalition. On May 21st, 2015, the coalition targeted a building in Jabal Hiran in Dhamar that was used by the Houthi group as a detention center for civilians, including two journalists. On October 29th, 2016, the coalition also bombed Zaidiya prison in Al-Hudaydah governorate and on December 13th, 2017, it launched an attack on a detention center in the Military Police headquarters in Sana’a – by Ali Abdullah</span></p><p><span><a href="https://mwatana.org/en/between-the-darkness-and-death/">https://mwatana.org/en/between-the-darkness-and-death/</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K)</strong></p><p><strong>The Degradation of History</strong></p><p>Violations Committed by the Warring Parties against Yemen’s Cultural Property</p><p>Executive Summary</p><p>The targeting of cultural property and monuments is one of the areas of agreement for all warring parties in Yemen. The destruction of historical monuments and artifacts and archeological and religious buildings is the main manifestation of the country’s descent into the abyss of a war without a resolution; a war that has affected everything and has not spared the life and property of Yemenis, including their ancient past and their unifying culture. Similarly, the damages caused by the war even affected the collective memory of Yemenis that is represented by their historical heritage and unique construction style, which is evident in their imposing fortresses, castles and high towers, and their original decorations on the walls of their places of worship.</p><p>Since the outbreak of armed conflicts in the middle of 2014<a href="https://mwatana.org/en/the-degradation-of-history-2/#_ftn34">[34]</a>, cultural objects in Yemen have been subjected to many different types of violations and attacks. These violations have affected many historical monuments, buildings and museums and took various forms, such as aerial bombardments, shelling attacks, vandalism, destruction and damage, as well as conducting hostile acts from the vicinity of these cultural objects or using them deliberately for direct military purposes. In addition, some cultural property has been subjected to composite violations; some have been subjected to airstrikes and ground shelling, military use and even destruction and damage.</p><p>All parties to the conflict have engaged in violations and attacks on cultural property. These attacks have caused enormous damage to some of these properties and even amounted to the destruction of two religious landmarks in Taiz (Al Sudi Dome – Al Rumaymeh Dome) by an extremist group active in areas under the authorities of President Hadi’s government.</p><p>During the period covered by this report, Mwatana for Human Rights documented 15 historical and archaeological sites – some of which were being used by Ansar Allah group (Houthis) – that were directly targeted by air attacks launched by the fighter jets of the Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Among these sites are the historic town of Baraqish and the northern gateway to the old Ma’rib dam.</p><p>Frequent air attacks by coalition aircrafts have also damaged historical buildings in the old city of Sana’a. The first air strike targeting the ancient city of Sana’a, listed on the World Heritage List<a href="https://mwatana.org/en/the-degradation-of-history-2/#_ftn35">[35]</a>, was on June 12<sup>th</sup>, 2015, and the latest strike was on September 20<sup>th</sup>, 2016, according to the incidents documented by Mwatana in the context of this report. The airstrike of the Arab coalition fighters also took place in other historical sites, such as the famous Kawkaban fortress, which is known for its wall and its unique construction. Religious landmarks were not immune to the missiles of the coalition strikes. Al-Hadi Mosque in Sa’ada was severely damaged by two coalition air strikes on Saturday, May 9<sup>th</sup>, 2015 and Sunday, May 10<sup>th</sup>, 2015. Al-Hadi Mosque is one of the most important religious landmarks in the ancient city of Sa’ada and the most important one at a religious level. In addition, Arab Coalition fighters attacked other cultural objects, including the Military Museum in Aden on July 15<sup>th</sup>, 2015. The same museum was previously attacked by a military force affiliated with Ansar Allah group (Houthis) and its former ally, former president Saleh. They shelled the museum with artillery shells as they stormed the Crater District in mid-April 2015, before taking over it and staying inside.</p><p>On the other hand, the Ansar Allah group (Houthis) and the forces of former President Saleh launched ground attacks with tanks and artillery, targeting archaeological sites, historic buildings and museums. These attacks clearly damaged and destroyed these monuments. On March 28<sup>th</sup>, 2015, an Ansar Allah (Houthis) tank targeted the Dar al-Hajar Palace in the Al-Houta district, the capital of Lahij governorate. The attack resulted in extensive destruction of parts of the palace. More than three years ago, many ground attacks by Ansar Allah group (Houthis) and the forces of former President Saleh focused on archaeological sites in the city of Taiz, which is known for its famous historical mosques with adorned domes and high minarets. On Wednesday, June 17<sup>th</sup>, 2016, at 4:30 pm, the historical Madrassa and Mosque of Al-Ashrafiya were subjected to sudden artillery bombardment by the Ansar Allah group (Houthis). The shelling targeted the eastern minaret of the mosque and resulted in a large gap in the center. The Ansar Allah group (the Houthis) has the highest rate in terms of using cultural objects for military purposes and carrying out hostile acts, starting with some historic fortresses and archaeological sites. On August 16<sup>th</sup>, 2014, the group’s fighters took control of the ancient city of Baraqish and used it for purely military purposes. Prior to their withdrawal, in early April 2016, they planted land mines on the borders of the archaeological city.</p><p>Other cultural properties were destroyed and vandalized by militant groups. On Friday, November 20<sup>th</sup>, 2015, a car bomb attack on the southwestern outskirts of the historic city of Shibam-Hadhramaut, caused minor and severe damages to around 240 houses, built of rammed earth<a href="https://mwatana.org/en/the-degradation-of-history-2/#_ftn36">[36]</a>.</p><p>In Aden, members of the Ansar al-Sharia group attacked the historical Hindu temple. They came aboard three military vehicles, stormed the temple, and destroyed the statues and paintings that it contained. The churches of the city of Aden were also affected, with many of their statues and icons destroyed by the Ansar Allah group (Houthis). More than 15 archaeological and historical sites and landmarks in the city were also affected, either by being used directly for military purposes, for carrying out military operations inside these sites or from areas adjacent to them or for refuge.</p><p><span><a href="https://mwatana.org/en/the-degradation-of-history-2/">https://mwatana.org/en/the-degradation-of-history-2/</a></span></p><p>Short film: <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tevghE3TUgo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tevghE3TUgo</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B H)</strong></p><p><strong>Eastern Africa to Yemen: One of the most dangerous migrant routes</strong></p><p>Tens of thousands of people migrate from Eastern Africa to Yemen each year – even though the country has been devastated by a civil war, and smugglers frequently blackmail and torture migrants. Most migrants are hoping to make it to Saudi Arabia, and find work there. Let’s take a closer look at this highly dangerous migrant route.</p><p>Crossing the ocean in small boats</p><p>To make it from Eastern Africa into Yemen, migrants have to cross the ocean. They are often sent out in small, crowded boats that are ill-equipped for the journey by traffickers. In January of this year, at least 52 people died off the shore of Djibouti, according to IOM. The migrants in the picture made it to the shores of Yemen. They arrived on the shores of Ras al-Ara in the Lahj region in late July of this year.</p><p>Robbed of their freedom</p><p>After enduring hours crammed on a wooden smuggling boats, migrants are often loaded into trucks by traffickers and driven to compounds in the desert. Nearly every migrant who lands in the coastal village of Ras al-Ara -- a migrant hotspot in Yemen -- is robbed of their freedom by traffickers, unable to continue their journey. </p><p>Imprisoned, families blackmailed </p><p>The migrants are imprisoned in hidden compounds, called “hush,” while their families are blackmailed into paying for their release. Yemeni authorities do little to stop these criminal activities, according to reports by AP. Most migrants are subjected to daily torments -- beatings, torture, starvation,... -- while many women and girls are raped by their captors. </p><p>Horrifying torture</p><p>This 17-year-old Ethopian migrant was tortured so brutally that he lost his leg. After Abdul-Rahman landed in Ras al-Ara, traffickers locked him up and asked for phone numbers of people who could transfer money for their release. He told his captors he didn't have a number, because he knew that couldn't ask his father for more money. He was beaten and left without food or water for days, weeks even. One night, one of the captors beat his leg to a pulp with a steel rod. Then, he was dumped in the desert. A passing driver brought him to a hospital, where his leg was amputated.

It’s important to note, however, that, historically speaking, he’s been anything but unique in his obsession with promoting such weapons exports (though he is uniquely loud about doing so).</p><p>The U.S. government’s stated <span><a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-arms-transfer-policy-shaping-way-ahead">rationales</a></span> for pouring arms into that ever-more-embattled region include: building partnerships with countries theoretically willing to fight alongside U.S. forces in a crisis; swapping arms for access to military bases in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and other Persian Gulf states; creating “stability” by building up allied militaries to be stronger than those of potential adversaries like Iran; and generating revenue for U.S. weapons contractors, as well as jobs for American workers. Of course, such sales have indeed benefited those contractors and secured access to bases in the region, but when it comes to promoting stability and security, historically it’s been another story entirely.</p><p>The Nixon Doctrine and the Initial Surge in Mideast Arms Sales</p><p>Washington’s role as the Middle East’s top arms supplier has its roots in <span><a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v01/d29">remarks</a></span> made by Richard Nixon half a century ago on the island of Guam.</p><p>The core of what came to be known as the <span><a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-nixon-doctrine-is-announced">Nixon Doctrine</a></span> was the arming of regional surrogates, countries with sympathetic rulers or governments that could promote U.S. interests without major contingents of the American military being on hand.

In addition, Saudi sales helped recoup some of the revenue streaming out of the U.S. to pay for higher energy prices exacted by the newly formed OPEC oil cartel. It was a process then quaintly known as “<span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/20/magazine/recycling-petrodollars-the-100-billion-understanding.html">recycling petrodollars</a></span>.”</p><p>The Carter Years and the Quest for Restraint</p><p>The freewheeling arms trade of the Nixon years eventually prompted a backlash. In 1976, for the first (and last) time, a presidential candidate -- Jimmy Carter -- made reining in the arms trade a <a href="https://nacla.org/article/carter%27s-arms-policy">central theme</a> of his 1976 campaign for the White House. He <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/president-carter-remarks-on-u-s-arms-sales-policy-may-1977">called for</a> imposing greater human-rights scrutiny on arms exports, reducing the total volume of arms transfers, and initiating talks with the Soviet Union on curbing sales to regions of tension like the Middle East.</p><p>Who Armed Saddam Hussein?</p><p>While the volume of those arms sales didn’t spike dramatically under President Ronald Reagan, his determination to weaponize anti-communist “freedom fighters” from Afghanistan to Nicaragua sparked the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/reagan-iran/">Iran-Contra scandal</a>. </p><p>Worse yet, the Reagan administration transferred arms and provided training to extremist mujahedeen factions in Afghanistan,</p><p>The Addiction Continues</p><p>Donald Trump has carried on the practice of offering weaponry in quantity to allies in the Middle East, especially the Saudis, though his major rationale for the deals is to <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/20/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-arms-sales-jamal-khashoggi">generate</a></span> domestic jobs and revenues for the major weapons contractors.

The question now is: Will Congress play a greater role in attempting to block such weapons deals with the Saudis and human-rights abusers or will America’s weapons-sales addiction and its monopoly position in the Middle Eastern arms trade simply continue, setting the stage for future disasters of every sort? – by William D.

Close to 20% of the population relies on aid to get a bare minimum of healthcare services.</p><p>Statistics show that only about half of the country’s medical centers are currently in operation – and they often lack the resources to provide the necessary treatment. This in part led to the 2017 cholera epidemic, the worst ever recorded.</p><p>In 2019, almost 16 million Yemenis are suffering from hunger.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Humanitarian-situation-in-Yemens-forgotten-war-worsens-608510">https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Humanitarian-situation-in-Yemens-forgotten-war-worsens-608510</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span>Film: by </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/ICRC_ye">ICRC Yemen: </a></span><span>Happy </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldChildrensDay?src=hashtag_click">#WorldChildrensDay</a></span><span>?

Director of the Center, Dr. Zayed Atef, called the International Diabetes Federation for emergency doses of insulin for diabetics, especially children.</p><p> He pointed out that the center receives 100 cases of diabetics, and faces great pressure due to lack of possibilities and scarcity of medicines. He explained that the closure of the Sana'a International Airport is causing the suffering of thousands of patients.</p><p>Atif said that "the International Diabetes Federation responded and sent emergency doses to Salalah Airport in the Sultanate of Oman, but these doses did not reach to date." He also pointed out that the International Diabetes Federation asked the center ship the emergency doses by land but due to need for specific conditions, receiving these doses should only be done through the airport in Sana'a.</p><p> On the other hand, the adviser of the National Center for Diabetes, Dr. Adel Al-Hadhrami, said that "if insulin does not arrive at a certain temperature and if it is not preserved, it will be damaged. If it is taken by the patient, his/her condition will get worst and become at risk of death."</p><p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=9834">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=9834</a></span></p><p><span>(A H)</span></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ghalebalsudmy"><span>@ghalebalsudmy: </span>We distributed over 40 basket food to poorest families in hodeidah &amp; Sana last two days.

Today, over 12 million-nearly every child- in Yemen is in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.</p><p>“Those who bear the responsibility, including the Yemeni authorities have fallen short of their promises and commitments to the children”, said Sara Beysolow Nyanti, UNICEF Yemen Representative. “The 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the convention should serve as a stark reminder to all of us to urgently recommit to our accountabilities to help the children of Yemen to survive and grow in a safe and peaceful environment”.</p><p>Too many children have been killed by the war in blatant attacks.

The risk of an infection is huge.”</p><p>Take Waleed, a patient in MSF’s reconstructive surgery hospital in Amman, Jordan. In 2016, he was walking down the street in the Yemeni town of Ibb when an aircraft opened fire at the building next to him. A wall collapsed, severely injuring his jaw and leg.</p><p>The impact of a bullet, an explosion or a collapsing wall on the human body can be major. It can cause significant internal damage, often requiring surgery to put it right. Complex bone fractures, for instance, may require multiple surgical interventions, increasing the risk of a bone becoming infected – if it was not already infected when the body was first injured.</p><p>Today, Waleed has still not recovered fully. This is not because of the damage inflicted by the collapsing wall, but because his wounds were infected by bacteria that became resistant to the very drugs that were supposed to heal him.</p><p>In times of war, health systems often break down, making it difficult for patients to get proper treatment, as happened to Waleed in war-torn Yemen.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.msf.org/how-msf-tackling-antibiotic-resistance-middle-east">https://www.msf.org/how-msf-tackling-antibiotic-resistance-middle-east</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/who">World Health Organization</a></span>: Yemen Conflict, Situation Report Issue No. 10, October 2019</p><p>Health System: 50 % of health facilities are functional and operating with serious shortages of medicine, equipment and staff.

In the first attempt, my memory brought up Yemen's bad experience with mediation during the last two decades.</p><p>In fact, Qatar, the U.N., the EU, the U.S. and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have all failed multiple times to mediate in several conflicts in Yemen since 2004.</p><p>What is next?</p><p>Yes, Yemenis should not wait for a military stalemate to start mediation efforts; they should not cry over spilled milk but open new doors and make more efforts for peaceful resolutions.</p><p>There is a severe need to coordinate mediation efforts with the growing number of international and regional organizations, civil society groups and other Yemeni people who are not directly involved in the conflict, and this is where Turkey can do more solid work to solve the conflict in Yemen.</p><p>At the very beginning of 2019, Çavuşoğlu gave a clear message about Yemen: "Finding a solution to the Yemen issue will be one of Turkey's priorities in 2019." I think the time has come for Turkey to take a firm step toward finding a solution for the crisis in Yemen.</p><p>Turkey's mediation efforts in Yemen should be in the form of non-military and voluntary actions. At the local level in Yemen, Turkey has the chance to start plans that aim to raise awareness of the crucial need for a peaceful resolution, build the capacity of the next-generation mediators, and support and host programs for Yemeni peace seekers. Such actions will build an important base for more concrete results in the near future.</p><p>Despite the fact that Turkey announced its support for the Saudi operation in Yemen only a few days after the intervention began in March 2015, Ankara has condemned its actions in the last three years and began to cooperate with Riyadh's enemy Iran, the Houthis main supporter. Rather than take such approaches, Turkey still has the chance to and should play a mediation role between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the main regional actors of the war in Yemen.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2019/11/20/will-turkey-succeed-in-facilitating-mediation-in-yemen">https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2019/11/20/will-turkey-succeed-in-facilitating-mediation-in-yemen</a></span></p><p><span>(B P)</span></p><p><span>[Sanaa gov.] </span>National Committee for Prisoners Affairs: Approved all UN Proposals, Pro-Saudi Aggression Rejected all</p><p>The head of the National Committee for Prisoners Affairs, Abdul Qader Al-Mortada, confirmed on Monday that all the proposals made by the UN envoy on the prisoners' exchange have been approved by the national party and rejected by the pro-Saudi aggression party.</p><p>Al-Mortada told Al-Thawrah newspaper, "We initiated the release of hundreds of prisoners from one side to prove good intentions and push the agreement into effect," adding that "the other party deals with the exchange of prisoners as a political issue and not a humanitarian one."</p><p><span><a href="https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=9818">https://english.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=9818</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp7a Saudi-Arabien und Iran / Saudi Arabia and Iran</span></h2><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p><span>From 2017: </span>The Unseen Middle Eastern Cold Wa<span>r</span></p><p><span>T</span>he rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran is seen as a cold war because of the similarities of foreign policy with each other just like what was seen between Russia and The United States during their cold war. An example is how western European countries and The United States created NATO to contain communism in eastern Europe and prevent The Soviet Union from invading western Europe and spreading their influence, this is similar to the creation of The Gulf Cooperation Council. The GCC was created so it can be a political, economic, and military union for the Persian Gulf countries. The GCC was created in 1981 and was founded byBahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, who are all countries ruled by a monarchy.</p><p>Just like the members of NATO, these middle eastern allies wanted to unite and protect their interests and preserve their power, especially since many Arab monarch states were overthrown over the years like Egypt, Yemen, and Iran.</p><p>The GCC was created right after The Islamic Revolution and during The Iran-Iraq War. With this two events occurring after the founding of the new Iranian republic, these Gulf countries decided to work together and form The GCC to prevent Iran from influencing Shia Muslims to being disobedient to their Sunni governments and influencing their citizens into having revolutions to overthrow the monarchies.</p><p>Therefore, The GCC formed during the Iran-Iraq War because they saw Iran as a threat to their security and needed to form an alliance with each other so in case if Iran ever tried to invade or attack a GCC member, Iran will be practically declaring war with all GCC members and the GCC members will watch out for each other. These gulf countries feared that Iran will be a threat to their power and will try to establish Shia governments in the area so they can be the dominant faith in the region and would change the way of life in the middle east and will become the ruling country – by Jonathan Coelho</p><p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/34800141/International_Relations_Term_Paper.docx?auto=bookmark">https://www.academia.edu/34800141/International_Relations_Term_Paper.docx?auto=bookmark</a> </span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp8 Saudi-Arabien / Saudi Arabia</span></h2><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Arab League Condemns Iran for Handing Yemen Embassy HQ to Houthis</p><p><span><a href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/2000761/arab-league-condemns-iran-handing-yemen-embassy-hq-houthis">https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/2000761/arab-league-condemns-iran-handing-yemen-embassy-hq-houthis</a></span></p><p>My comment: LOL.

This city became an important transit point for Hajj and trade convoys, and an important center of stability. At that time, political conditions were not good in the Arabian Peninsula. It was suffering from neglect, disintegration, rivalry and widespread ignorance and illiteracy.<br /> In 1157 AH / 1744 AD, the Emirate of Diriyah was taken over by Imam Muhammad bin Saud, who had a good administrative sense and a future outlook, and he began to change, announcing the establishment of the first Saudi state, to begin a new phase in the history of the entire Arabian Peninsula, where he laid the building block of the great unity, which united most of its parts. A unity that the Arabian Peninsula and all Arabs did not know for centuries, and this unity became a source of pride for all Arabs and Muslims, and as a result of this unity, the city of Diriyah has become the capital of a sprawling state, and a source of economic, social, intellectual and cultural attraction.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=2001219">https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=2001219</a></span></p><p><span>and in Wikipedia: </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diriyah">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diriyah</a></span></p><p><span>(A)</span></p><p><span>Films: </span><span>Great news- must see TV: While </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/US?src=hashtag_click">#US</a></span><span> ambassador to </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Riyadh?src=hashtag_click">#Riyadh</a></span><span> was ensuring rollercoasters project is going, people of </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Riyadh?src=hashtag_click">#Riyadh</a></span><span> put on an amazing show of flooding across the city.

But the final price and size of the Aramco listing will be less than what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman long hoped for—and promised. On Sunday and Monday, Saudi officials canceled “roadshows”—pitch meetings with prospective investors—in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In the end, the vaunted coming-out party of Saudi Arabia’s crown jewel will be a local affair, with the shares sold almost exclusively to Saudi nationals and investment funds in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and countries like Russia and China.</p><p>That points toward a tough future for Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious plans to wean the Saudi economy off oil—the basis for his <span><a href="https://vision2030.gov.sa/en">Saudi Vision 2030</a></span> announced in 2016—and entice foreign investors to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into the kingdom.</p><p>Why the apparent about-face on courting international investors? The whole point of the listing, in addition to raising cash, was to juice international investment to fund Saudi Vision 2030.</p><p>There are all sorts of reasons for big international investors to be leery of snapping up shares in Aramco—above and beyond the lingering reputational taint of doing business in Saudi Arabia after the gruesome killing of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018.</p><p>First and foremost, there’s the valuation itself.</p><p>So what does this star-crossed listing say about Saudi Arabia and its ambitious plans for economic transformation?</p><p>Nothing encouraging. Saudi Arabia hoped to use the windfall to kick-start new economic projects, such as tourism. And while the listing could still bring in about $25 billion, that’s a far cry from what Mohammed bin Salman hoped for—or what he extracted from rich Saudis in his so-called anti-corruption drive between 2017 and 2019, in which he collected more than $100 billion.</p><p>To make Saudi Vision 2030 a reality, the crown prince needs to convince international investors, not just Saudis, to put money into the kingdom. But <span><a href="https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/saudi-arabias-vision-2030-remains-hard-sell-mbs-aramco-iran">foreign investment</a></span> in Saudi Arabia still hasn’t recovered to the levels it had just a few years ago—and is nowhere near attracting the kind of capital it needs if it is to transform a one-dimensional, oil-driven economy into a truly diversified one. And the lack of investor appetite for Aramco, which is incredibly profitable, highlights a broader lack of interest in pouring money into Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Mohammed bin Salman “needs the money desperately,” said Sen of Energy Aspects. “I would say, and this is my take, this listing is much more about revenue generation.” – by Keith Johnson</p><p><span><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/18/saudi-aramco-listing-mohammed-bin-salman-ipo-oil/">https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/18/saudi-aramco-listing-mohammed-bin-salman-ipo-oil/</a></span></p><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Saudi Arabia convicts 18 people of bribery and fraud - SPA</p><p>Saudi Arabia has convicted 18 people, including government officials and private sector employees, of bribery, fraud and abuse of office, state news agency SPA said on Tuesday, without identifying them.</p><p>The rulings followed an investigation by the public prosecutor, who presented “strong evidence” of corruption, SPA said.

Landmine Monitor 2019</p><p>Preface</p><p>Landmines and Explosive Remnants of War</p><p>Peace agreements may be signed and hostilities may cease, but landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) are an enduring legacy of conflict.</p><p>Antipersonnel mines are munitions designed to explode from the presence, proximity, or contact of a person. This includes improvised landmines, also known as improvised explosive devices (IEDs), with those same victim-activated characteristics. Antivehicle mines are munitions designed to explode from the presence, proximity, or contact of a vehicle as opposed to a person. Landmines are victim-activated and indiscriminate; whoever triggers the mine, whether a child or a soldier, becomes its victim. Mines emplaced during a conflict against enemy forces can still kill or injure civilians decades later.</p><p>About this report</p><p>This is the 21st annual Landmine Monitor report. It is the sister publication to the Cluster Munition Monitor report, first published in November 2010. <em>Landmine Monitor 2019</em> provides a global overview of the landmine situation. Chapters on developments in specific countries and other areas are available in online Country Profiles at <span><a href="http://www.the-monitor.org/cp">www.the-monitor.org/cp</a></span>.</p><p>Landmine Monitorcovers mine ban policy, use, production, trade, and stockpiling, and also includes information on contamination, clearance, casualties, victim assistance, and support for mine action. As well as a twenty-year review, this report focuses on calendar year 2018, with information included up to November 2019 when possible.</p><p>Yemen</p><p>Houthi forces in Yemen used antipersonnel and antivehicle mines during 2018 and 2019, primarily on the west coast of the country near the port of Hodeida. Houthi forces are also reported to have used landmines in the past along the coast, along the border with Saudi Arabia, around key towns, along roads, and to cover retreats.</p><p>A Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen convened by the UN Human Rights Council reported in September 2019, “The use of landmines, both anti-personnel and anti-vehicle, by the Houthis has resulted in significant harm to civilians.” According to the report, the group […]</p><p>In April 2019, Human Rights Watch reported that Houthi-planted landmines had killed at least 140 civilians since 2018.44 In November 2018, employees at the Hodeidah port accused Houthi forces of placing landmines in the area around the port’s entrances.45 Previously, the Yemen Mine Action Center (YEMAC) reported that Houthi forces laid more than 300,000 landmines between 2016 and 2018.46 International media reported that mine clearance teams funded by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) cleared and destroyed hundreds of Houthilaid mines in 2018.</p><p>There is no evidence to suggest that members of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition have used landmines in Yemen.</p><p><span><a
