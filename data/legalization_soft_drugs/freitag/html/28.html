These violations were committed along the border between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, particularly in Najran and Jazan Regions, in which snipers and various weapons were used, including missiles and projectiles.<br /> The Coalition Forces also said that the response to the sources of fire was made in accordance with the approved rules of engagement. As the Coalition Forces announces this, it will continue confronting the violations of ceasefire agreement and continue imposing no-fly and no-sail zones as well as air reconnaissance against any movements made by Houthi militias and their supporters, stressing at the same time their commitment to the policy of self-restraint towards these violations.<br /> The Coalition Forces hold the Houthi militias and their supporters the responsibility of disrupting the access of humanitarian aid to the areas besieged by the militias in Yemen.

During ceasefire, the Houthis might move in their territory from wherever to wherever, that is nothing the Saudis would be granted to supervise assuming the role of some sort of police. – “continue imposing no-fly and no-sail zones” is another breach of ceasefire. “Imposing no-fly zones” is a bad joke, the only ones using military aircraft over Yemen are the Saudis and their allies. This announcement only can refer to civilian flight the Saudis will not admit to go and leave from and to Sanaa and Hodeida airports. To threaten any civilian flights there would be another breach of the ceasefire – by things like that, the Saudis are showing that they accept the ceasefire only very unwillingly.</p><p>Comment by Judith Brown to BBC article, photo and map: Hadi in control????

Men and boys form the vast majority of direct victims of armed conflict and associated impacts like forced recruitment or arbitrary detention. Women bear the burdens of running the households under extreme stress and are often exposed to different forms of gender-based violence. During emergencies, women and girls become more vulnerable as basic services collapse and livelihoods diminish. In order to better understand the impact of armed conflict on men, women, boys, and girls, and the changes that have resulted in gender roles and relationships at household and community levels since the onset of conflict in March 2015, Oxfam, CARE and GenCap in Yemen collaborated to collect and analyse available data to further inform immediate humanitarian response as well as longer-term programming in Yemen.</p><p>Gender inequality and the specific barriers faced by Yemeni women and girls in achieving their full potential have long been recognized as both underlying and direct causes of food insecurity, malnutrition and poverty in Yemen. While the Yemen crisis is evolving rapidly, a general pattern of deteriorating gender relations and the marginalization of women from participation and leadership in decision-making forums appear evident. Advances made in recent years to address gender inequality in Yemen are at risk of being reversed. Such advances include recognition of the importance of including women in peace talks as a driver for peace and security in a country that has long been affected by multi-faceted conflicts. Secondly, there are reports of increasing marginalization of women as well as increasing levels of gender-based violence (GBV), and fears have been expressed that this will serve to further reinforce gender inequality in the long-term reconstruction phase.</p><p>A scoping study was conducted by CARE and Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Gender Capacity Standby Project (GenCap) to review and assess available information on the impact of the conflict on gender roles and relations, and the consequently different needs of women, girls, boys, and men.</p><p>It found that while there was good pre-conflict information on gender issues in Yemen, most assessments conducted since March 2015 have been ‘gender blind’. The study concluded that further gender and generational analysis is needed to ensure that humanitarian programming in Yemen is aware of and responsive to changes in gender relations, so that it meets the different needs of women, men, boys, and girls</p><p>Humanitarian programmes in all sectors need to work to safeguard the progress on gender equality that was made prior to the emergency, continue advancing that progress, and lay the foundations for sustainable and gender-equitable recovery and reconstruction, and for the participation of women in peace talks and in the protection of their social and economic rights – by Wolfgang Gressmann</p><p><a href="http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/from-the-ground-up-gender-and-conflict-analysis-in-yemen-620112">http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/from-the-ground-up-gender-and-conflict-analysis-in-yemen-620112</a></p><p><strong>20.10.2016 – Telepolis (** A K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Saudische Bomber vor Angriff in Sanaa von US-Luftwaffe betankt?</strong></p><p>US-Militärexperten gehen von einer Beihilfe der US-Kräfte in der Region aus.

Nach einem <a href="http://www.alternet.org/print/world/did-us-assist-sanaa-bombing">Bericht</a> des US-amerikanischen Nachrichtenportals AlterNet könnten nicht nur die lasergelenkten Bomben aus US-Produktion stammen (<a href="https://www.heise.de/tp/news/Trauergemeinde-im-Jemen-offenbar-von-US-Bomben-getroffen-3347833.html">Trauergemeinde im Jemen offenbar von US-Bomben getroffen</a>, ). Offenbar wurden die saudi-arabischen Bomber zudem von US-Militärs betankt. Sie sollen den Angriff auf ein Gemeindezentrum dadurch erst möglich gemacht haben.</p><p>Die These vertritt der Rüstungsexperte Pierre Sprey, der in den 1960er Jahren unter US-Verteidigungsminister Robert McNamara im Pentagon an der Entwicklung von Kampfflugzeugen beteiligt war. Sprey gilt, so heißt es bei AlterNet, als Chefentwickler der F-16, deren Vorgänger, F-15, von der saudischen Luftwaffe benutzt wird.</p><p>"Wenn das saudische Kampfflugzeug (das den Angriff in Sanaa geflogen hat) auf dem größten saudischen Stützpunkt, der Prinz-Sultan-Luftwaffenbasis, stationiert war, dann ist es fast sicher, dass es von der US-Luftwaffe während des Einsatzes neu betankt wurde", sagte Sprey gegenüber AlterNet. Es gebe zwar einen weiteren Luftwaffenstützpunkt, die König-Khaled-Basis, nahe der Grenze zum Jemen. Es sei aber unwahrscheinlich, dass die saudische Luftwaffe diese Einrichtung nutzt, weil die aufständischen Huthi-Rebellen sie bereits mit Scud-Raketen angegriffen haben. Sergeant Major a.D. Michael Adams, ein ehemaliger Angehöriger der Special Forces, bestätigte diese Einschätzung.</p><p>Doch auch wenn die saudischen F-15-Kampfflugzeuge von einer Jemen-nahen Basis gestartet wären, hätten sie nur rund eine Viertelstunde Operationszeit über dem Rebellengebiet gehabt. Über dem Luftraum der von den Rebellen kontrollierten Städte im Südwesten des Landes hätten sich die Flugzeuge sogar nur fünf Minuten Zeit aufhalten können.

"double tap"-Luftschläge auf eine Beerdigungsfeier im Jemen ausgeführt zu haben. In einem Bericht an den UN-Sicherheitsrat, welcher IRIN vorliegt, spricht die Kommission insbesondere bei dem zweiten Angriff der Koalition davon, dass sie im Rahmen des humanitären Völkerrechts "ihre Pflichten verletzt hat" und "keine wirksamen vorbeugenden Maßnahmen zur Minimierung ziviler Opfer, inklusive von Ersthelfern" getroffen habe.</p><p>Die Untersuchung der Expertenkommission bietet einen sehr viel detaillierten Einblick in den Vorfall als die Ermittlungen des JIAT [eigene „Untersuchung“ der Saudis].<br /> Die VIP-Gäste seien für den weiteren Verlauf des Konflikts von entscheidender Bedeutung gewesen, heißt es im Bericht: "Hätte der Angriff mehr von den hier aufgeführten Personen getötet, [...] dann hätte die Houti-Saleh-Allianz einen vernichtenden politischen und militärischen Schlag zu verkraften gehabt."<br /> Versehen mit der Unterschrift des federführenden Kommissionsvertreters, Ahmed Himmiche und am 17. Oktober dem Vorsitzenden des Sanktionsausschusses des Sicherheitsrates für den Jemen zugegangen, enthält das Schreiben eine Liste von 25 hochrangigen Offiziellen, die bei der Beerdigung des Vaters von Saleh´s Innenminister Jalal Al-Ruwaysahn zu Gast waren. Ganz oben auf der Liste: Saleh persönlich, der nach seiner Absetzung im Zuge von Protesten der Bevölkerung sein Heil bei den Houti-Rebellen suchte. <br /> Laut des Berichts der Kommission, verließen Saleh und sein Sohn vor dem Angriff den Ort des Geschehens.<br /> Die zwei Luftschläge, ungefähr um 15:20 Uhr und 15:30 Uhr lokaler Zeit [GMT+3], "fielen mit dem Zeitpunkt zusammen, an dem die höchste Zahl an Trauerndenen erwartet wurde", schreibt die Kommission. Videomaterial des Angriffs erschienen kurz nach der Attacke in Sozialen Medien und zeigen deutlich Rauchschwaden, bevor weitere Bomben [ordinance = Kampfmittel] fallen. Außerdem ist das Geräusch von Kampfflugzeugen zu hören.<br /> Das Schreiben der Expertenkommission nimmt auch Bezug auf lokale Bräuche, nach denen "politische und militärische Führer und Zivilisten, eine Teilnahme nicht vermeiden konnten."<br /> Die Versammlungshalle, wo die Menschen zusammenkamen, bietet Platz für 1.000 bis 2.000 Personen. Hunderte Zivilisten, darunter Kinder, waren während des Angriffs anwesend. <br /> Angesichts der Bedeutung der Familie, welche die Feier ausrichtete, der Größe des Saals und die übliche hohe Zahl von Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmern bei solchen Anlässen, kommt die Kommission zu dem Schluss, dass die von Saudi-Arabien angeführte Koalition "vernünftigerweise zu dem Schluss kommen musste", dass "sich eine überaus hohe Zahl an Zivilisten, darunter auch Kinder auf dem Anwesen aufhalten und aus diesem Grund [...] jeder Luftangriff eine hohe Anzahl an zivilen Opfern nach sich ziehen würde".</p><p>Die Kommission nimmt Bezug zu relevanten Abschnitten des Internationalen Humanitären Völkerrechts (International Humanitarian Law - IHL), insbesondere was den zweiten Schlag angeht: "Das IHL verbietet Angriffe gegen <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hors_de_combat">hors de combat</a>, Verwundete und medizinisches Personal und Einheiten."<br /> "Der zweite Luftangriff, der sich drei bis acht Minuten nach dem ersten Luftangriff ereignete, führte mit an Sicherheit grenzender Wahrscheinlichkeit zu noch mehr Opfern unter den bereits Verwundeten und den Ersthelfern" heißt es weiter. "Das Timing zwischen den Explosionen legt den Schuss nahe, dass es sich um den bewussten Einsatz der ‘double tap’-Taktik handelte, in deren Folge Individuen, die auf die erste Explosion reagieren, von der Zweiten getroffen werden." <br /> "Die Kommission stellt hinsichtlich des zweiten Luftschlags weiter fest, dass die von Saudi-Arabien geführte Koalition ihre Verpflichtungen, was den Schutz von hors de combat-Personen und Verwundeten angeht, bei diesem ‘double tap'-Angriff verletzt und bei diesem zweiten Angriff keine wirksamen vorbeugenden Maßnahmen zur Minimierung ziviler Opfer, inklusive von Ersthelfern getroffen hat", so das Schreiben – von Samuel Oakford</p><p><a href="http://vergessene-kriege.blogspot.de/2016/10/un-experten-luftschlage-im-jemen.html">http://vergessene-kriege.blogspot.de/2016/10/un-experten-luftschlage-im-jemen.html</a></p><p>English version:</p><p><strong>20.10.2016 – IRIN (** A K)</strong></p><p><strong>EXCLUSIVE: Double tap attack on Yemen funeral violated humanitarian law - UN panel</strong></p><p>A UN panel of experts has accused the Saudi Arabia-led coalition of a deliberate “double tap” airstrike on a funeral gathering in Yemen earlier this month. In a report to the UN Security Council, obtained by IRIN, the panel says that the coalition’s second strike in particular “violated its obligations” under international law and it “did not take effective precautionary measures to minimize harm to civilians, including the first responders” on the scene.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/sanctions/2140/panel-of-experts/reports">panel of experts</a> investigation offers greater detail of the incident than the JIAT’s account.</p><p>The VIP guests were of significance to the direction of the conflict, the report states: “Had the attack killed or seriously injured more of the individuals listed… then the Houthi-Saleh alliance would have been dealt a devastating political and military blow.”</p><p>Signed by the panel’s coordinator, Ahmed Himmiche, and sent on 17 October to the chair of a Security Council Yemen sanctions committee, it includes a list of 25 top officials present at the funeral, held for the father of Saleh’s interior minister Jalal Al-Ruwaysahn. At the top of the list is Saleh himself, who threw his lot in with Houthi rebels after being unseated by popular protests in 2011.</p><p>According to the panel’s report, Saleh and his son left prior to the attack.</p><p>The two attacks, at roughly 3:20 pm and 3:30 pm local time, “coincided with a time when the funeral was expected to receive the highest number of mourners,” reported the panel. Video of one strike emerged on social media shortly after the incident, and clearly showed the hall already smoking as further ordinance fell. The sound of a jet could be heard.</p><p>The panel’s letter referenced local custom that meant “political and military leaders, and civilians, could not avoid attending.”</p><p>The community hall where the gathering took place fits between 1,000 and 2,000 people. Hundreds of civilians, including children, were present when it was attacked.</p><p>Given the prominence of the family for whom the funeral was held, the size of the hall and high public attendance common at such wakes, the panel concluded that the Saudi-led coalition “could reasonably be expected to conclude” there would be “a significantly high number of civilians, including children, at the venue and consequently… any air strike would result in a high number of civilian casualties.”</p><p>Focus on second strike</p><p>The panel makes reference to relevant provisions of International Humanitarian Law (IHL), especially with regard to the second strike: “IHL prohibits attacks against hors de combat, the wounded, and medical personnel and units.”</p><p>“The second air strike, which occurred three to eight minutes after the first air strike almost certainly resulted in more casualties to the already wounded and first responders," it reads, adding that "the timing between the explosions indicates the deliberate use of the ‘double tap’ tactic, the consequences of which are that individuals responding to the first explosion are caught by the second.”</p><p>“The Panel thus finds, in respect of the second air strike, that the Saudi Arabia-led coalition violated its obligations in respect of persons hors de combat and the wounded in this ‘double tap’ attack, and did not take effective precautionary measures to minimize harm to civilians, including the first responders, in the second strike,” says the letter – by Samuel Oakford</p><p><a href="https://www.irinnews.org/news/2016/10/20/exclusive-double-tap-attack-yemen-funeral-violated-humanitarian-law-un-panel">https://www.irinnews.org/news/2016/10/20/exclusive-double-tap-attack-yemen-funeral-violated-humanitarian-law-un-panel</a></p><p>20.10.2016 – Reuters (* A K P)</p><p>Saudi coalition violated law with Yemen funeral strike: U.N. monitors</p><p>A Saudi Arabia-led military campaign in Yemen violated international humanitarian law with a so-called "double tap" air strike on a funeral gathering in the rebel-held capital Sanaa, United Nations sanctions monitors told the Security Council.</p><p>The U.N. monitors said there were two air strikes in quick succession on the Oct. 8 funeral, which was attended by many top political and security figures from the Iran-allied Houthi rebels and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.</p><p>In an Oct. 17 report, seen by Reuters, the monitors said they found "in respect of the second air strike, that the Saudi Arabia-led coalition violated its obligations in respect of hors de combat and the wounded in this 'double tap' attack."</p><p>"The second air strike, which occurred three to eight minutes after the first air strike, almost certainly resulted in more casualties to the already wounded and the first responders," the U.N. monitors said.</p><p>"These first responders included civilians who immediately entered the area after the first air strike to provide urgent first aid and undertake casualty evacuation," the report said.</p><p>The monitors recommended that the Security Council consider asking members of the Saudi-led coalition to stop using "double tap" attacks.</p><p>The U.N. monitors found that the Saudi-led coalition "did not take effective precautionary measures to minimize harm to civilians, including first responders, in the second strike." – By Michelle Nichols</p><p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-saudi-un-idUSKCN12K2F1">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-saudi-un-idUSKCN12K2F1</a></p><p>Comment: Mohamad Shami writes an important statement worth some thoughts:</p><p>1.

Indeed, given the overwhelming US military presence in Yemen’s region, including the centre for East African operations <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/10/21/stealth-expansion-of-secret-us-drone-base-in-africa/">in Djibouti</a>, we might conclude that this is really just another US coalition – operating under the Saudi ‘flag of convenience’. Not only are the Saudi planes supplied and presumably maintained by the US, but all the missiles and bombs – cluster bombs and bunker busters and who knows what else – have been supplied by the US, and even re-supplied during the course of the war on Yemen. In addition to that is the ‘assistance with targeting’ provided by US and UK personnel both on the ground in the Saudi peninsula and through multiple surveillance platforms.</p><p>This interdependency between the US and the Saudis can hardly be concealed, yet its true nature cannot be admitted.</p><p>Given these links it was impossible to believe the US would really ‘review its cooperation’ with the ‘Saudi Coalition’ – or should have been. But no matter – within days of the review the US found a reason to renew arms supplies to fight the Houthis when missiles were fired at the USS Mason in the Red Sea from Yemen. Or this is what they said.</p><p>At about the same time as this direct entry into the Yemen conflict by the US, the results of an internal Saudi enquiry into the funeral bombing were released, finding that the strike was ‘not authorised’ and ‘based on false information from a Yemeni army source’. It is hard to get your head around the double-think and mendacity of these claims, and it was clearly beyond the mental capacity of some mainstream Western media reporters.</p><p>This was despite these media having themselves revealed the true motive behind the Saudi’s murderous attack.</p><p>The problem for SBS was that the Saudis’ ‘false information’ was exactly what SBS had shown to be true only a few days earlier – that top figures in the Houthi military leadership were present at the funeral as claimed by their source, and the strike – a perfect opportunity to ‘decapitate’ the new Yemeni government – was quite clearly not ‘un-authorised’.</p><p>But SBS baulked at this chance to finally start reporting news instead of just passing on US/NATO propaganda about the ‘Iranian-backed Houthi rebels’ fighting a ‘civil war’ against the ‘internationally-recognised’ Mansour Hadi government.</p><p>Perhaps it had no choice, after passing on a carefully woven but completely false narrative about Yemen for the last five years.</p><p>Most of those hapless followers of the Western MSM would have no idea that Yemen has a functioning government based in the capital Sana’a and supported by the vast majority of Yemenis, and that the ‘internationally recognized’ government is not actually recognized by Yemenis because they had no part in electing it.</p><p>Just before the Saudi-led bombing campaign began in March 2015, talks on a ‘power-sharing agreement’ between the Houthis, former President Saleh’s faction and the now-exiled leaders finally <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/06/29/why-the-yemen-peace-talks-collapsed/">collapsed</a>, with the resignation of the UN mediator Jamal Benomar. Hadi – who was never elected but merely appointed following the ousting of Saleh – was long past his mandate, but his Saudi backers refused to concede to the Houthis.</p><p>As with other asymmetric conflicts in the region – notably in Palestine and Syria – the ‘peace’ sought by the aggressors is one where the victims are asked to put down their weapons and concede defeat, submitting to the ‘international community’s’ choice of leadership and political alignment.</p><p>Presumably there will be some people in Riyadh, Washington and London, who will be saying ‘the price was worth it’ – even though it cost them nothing.

Wie berichtet wird, setzt die saudische Luftwaffe bei ihren Luftangriffen im Jemen, von denen ein erheblicher Teil zivile Ziele trifft, auch Tornado- und Eurofighter-Kampfjets ein, die partiell in der Bundesrepublik hergestellt wurden. Zur Zeit wird zudem über den Verkauf weiterer 48 Eurofighter an Saudi-Arabien verhandelt. Riad hat sich auch Luna-Drohnen aus Deutschland liefern lassen, wie sie im Afghanistan-Krieg eingesetzt wurden; mindestens eine von ihnen ist im jemenitischen Kampfgebiet abgefangen worden. Darüber hinaus nutzen die saudischen Streitkräfte Munition aus deutscher Produktion; die südafrikanische Firmentochter des Düsseldorfer Rheinmetall-Konzerns arbeitet eng mit einer neuen saudischen Munitionsfabrik zusammen, die auch Fliegerbomben produziert. Schließlich erhält Saudi-Arabien deutsche Patrouillenboote, die etwa für Seeblockaden genutzt werden können; mit einer solchen Seeblockade hat Riad den Jemen in eine gravierende Hungersnot getrieben, die unter anderem 1,5 Millionen unterernährte Kinder hervorgebracht hat. UN-Organisationen laufen Sturm.</p><p>Kampfjets für Saudi-Arabien</p><p>Saudi-Arabien wird voraussichtlich eine neue Lieferung Eurofighter erhalten. Dies berichten britische Medien. Demnach verhandelt Riad, das bereits im Jahr 2006 72 Stück des partiell in Deutschland produzierten Kampfjets bestellt und einen guten Teil davon inzwischen erhalten hat, zur Zeit über den Kauf von 48 weiteren Exemplaren. Das Geschäft wird über Großbritannien abgewickelt, das ebenfalls an der Eurofighter-Herstellung beteiligt ist und schon Mitte der 1980er Jahre den Verkauf der ebenfalls in der Bundesrepublik koproduzierten Tornado-Jets an Saudi-Arabien organisierte. Dem Eurofighter-Konsortium mit Sitz in Hallbergmoos bei München gelten die Verhandlungen als hochwillkommen.</p><p>Schulung durch die Bundeswehr</p><p>Dokumentiert ist hingegen neben dem Einsatz der Tornados und der Eurofighter auch der Einsatz der in Deutschland produzierten Drohne Luna im Jemen.</p><p>Den Vertrag zur Lieferung von zehn Luna-Drohnen hatte die Firma EMT aus dem oberbayerischen Penzberg im Dezember 2010 geschlossen - in Verbindung mit einer Zusage des Bundesverteidigungsministeriums, Soldaten zur Ausbildung saudischer Militärs im Gebrauch der Drohne nach Saudi-Arabien zu entsenden. Tatsächlich reisten im Januar 2011 drei Soldaten der Bundeswehr in die Golfdiktatur, um dort etwa 20 saudische Kollegen rund neun Wochen lang zu schulen. Die "taktischen Missionsflüge", die Teil des Ausbildungsprogramms waren, wurden laut Auskunft des Bundesverteidigungsministeriums "im grenznahen Bereich zum Jemen" durchgeführt - eine Tatsache, aus der das Ministerium ableitete, das Gerät werde "zu Aufklärungszwecken im Rahmen der Grenzsicherung" genutzt.[4] Dass eine Luna-Drohne im April 2015 in der Provinz Saada abgefangen wurde, die damals von der saudischen Luftwaffe besonders massiv bombardiert wurde (german-foreign-policy.com berichtete [5]), belegt ihre Nutzung zu Aufklärungszwecken auch im Krieg.</p><p>1.000-Pfund-Bomben</p><p>Auch Munition, die die saudischen Streitkräfte im Jemen-Krieg verschießen, stammt aus deutscher Produktion oder zumindest aus Fabriken, an denen deutsche Unternehmen beteiligt sind. So hat schon im Mai 2015 ein Mitarbeiter der Menschenrechtsorganisation Human Rights Watch in einem von Riad bombardierten Gebiet eine nicht zur Explosion gelangte 1.000-Pfund-Bombe gefunden, deren Code, wie berichtet wird, "auf die Munitionsfabrik der italienischen Rheinmetall-Tochter RWM Italia auf Sardinien" hinwies.[6] RWM Italia und Rheinmetall Italia führten in den Jahren 2014 und 2015 Rüstungsgüter im Wert von 71,5 Millionen Euro nach Saudi-Arabien aus.</p><p>Seeblockade mit Folgen</p><p>Aus Deutschland beliefert wird schließlich auch die saudische Marine. Ende Mai ist das erste von insgesamt 48 für Riad bestimmten Patrouillenbooten in der Wolgaster Peene-Werft der Bremer Lürssen-Gruppe fertiggestellt worden und zur Endausrüstung in den werfteigenen Hafen überstellt worden. Anfang Juli wurde dann bekannt, dass die Bundesregierung die Lieferung der Boote genehmigt hat. Die Patrouillenboote sind unter anderem zum Schutz von Offshore-Anlagen sowie zur Eindämmung von Piraterie und Schmuggel geeignet; sie können damit auch zur Realisierung einer Seeblockade genutzt werden.</p><p><a href="http://www.german-foreign-policy.com/de/fulltext/59465">http://www.german-foreign-policy.com/de/fulltext/59465</a></p><p><strong>20.10.2016 – Foreign Policy (** A P)</strong></p><p><strong>How to End Saudi Arabia’s War of Paranoia</strong></p><p>The only way to solve Yemen's war, and beat back its al-Qaeda franchise, is to dissolve the country entirely.</p><p>Paranoia has long been the basis of Saudi policymaking on Yemen. It used to be paranoia about the Yemenis themselves; now it’s about Iranians. Yemen’s Houthi rebels are variously “Iranian-supported,” “Iranian-backed,” or “Iranian-influenced.” The last is my preferred description since it clarifies that, while they model themselves after Lebanon’s Hezbollah and have adopted the slogan “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, damn the Jews, power to Islam,” they ultimately want to be masters of their own fates more than Iranian surrogates. (And as members of the Zaidi sect they are only Shiite-like rather than actual Shiites.)</p><p>There is good reason to doubt these rebels pose a direct threat to Riyadh, outside the confines of Saudi paranoia.</p><p>Nonetheless, as an apparent quid pro quo for tolerating Washington’s nuclear rapprochement with Tehran, Riyadh has demanded U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting to re-establish in Sanaa the rule of Hadi. (Hadi, for the present moment, prefers the greater security of a Riyadh hotel suite.) There’s an additional factor, which makes the favors run 2-to-1 in Riyadh’s direction: Washington wants Saudi involvement and a stamp of approval for the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.</p><p>Fear, if not quite paranoia, could also describe official Washington’s attitude toward Yemen. Its rocky hillsides have been the training areas for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).</p><p>There’s a crucial difference in Saudi and U.S. interests that quickly becomes apparent. Whereas Riyadh’s thinking is dominated by Iran’s support for the Houthi rebels who control the capital and much of what was once North Yemen (or, more formally, the Yemen Arab Republic), Washington’s anxieties focus on the south.</p><p>Washington’s and Riyadh’s separate wars are bound together in a manner not necessarily obvious to outsiders. The Royal Saudi Air Force and the U.S. Air Force are sharing Yemen’s airspace and adjoining, even overlapping, battle space. The two countries have to cooperate and therefore largely tolerate the behavior of the other party.</p><p>But that tolerance is under strain.</p><p>U.S. concern for Saudi tactics had meant reduced levels of cooperation. Inflight refueling was curtailed, meaning that Saudi F-15s could not loiter in Yemeni airspace, waiting for targets to present themselves. And cooperation was reduced on “targeting” — the curious technical word meaning what size of bomb to drop, from what height, from what direction, and even at what time of day, the latter so as to reduce “collateral damage” or, more accurately, civilian casualties. The Saudis had already been targeting clinics and schools and the justification — that the Houthis were placing military stores and headquarters in or close to them — was wearing thin.</p><p>The bombing of a funeral two weeks ago was both a humanitarian catastrophe and a major tactical disaster for the overall strategy of the anti-Houthi war. Even though the target was a Yemeni politician allied to the Houthis, bombing such a gathering was contrary to the ethics of the U.S. military.</p><p>The U.S. strategy should be to maintain a cease-fire that could be brokered into a power-sharing arrangement in the north. Hadi, Washington’s and Saudi Arabia’s man, technically controls from his Riyadh hotel suite the majority of Yemen territory. Unfortunately that land is the empty part of Yemen, with perhaps a population of only 3 million. The Houthi-Saleh alliance controls much less of the ground, but the mountainous part is militarily defensible. Additionally, this territory is home to more than 20 million people, the bulk of the country’s population.</p><p>The partition of Yemen, a return to Ibn Saud’s deathbed wish, should have a clear logic for all sides. The south wants it. Hadi himself may prefer it. The crucial local foreign power in the south, the UAE, is also said to think it is the best option. Distracted by its involvements elsewhere, Iran may not oppose it. It may depend on whether Saudi Arabia and, more particularly, its defense minister and deputy crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, can be convinced of the wisdom of his grandfather’s deathbed words.</p><p>Barring another outrage in Yemen with civilian casualties or a terrorist attack in the United States, Washington’s efforts over the next few months of political transition at home are likely to be limited. But the problem of Yemen, or of the two Yemens, will be waiting for the next U.S. president – by Simon Henderson</p><p><a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/10/20/two-yemens-are-better-than-one-saudi-houthi-iran/">http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/10/20/two-yemens-are-better-than-one-saudi-houthi-iran/</a> =<a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/how-to-end-saudi-arabias-war-of-paranoia">http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/how-to-end-saudi-arabias-war-of-paranoia</a></p><p>Comments by Judith Brown: A fair article but like many of the others it does not recognise that Hadi has international recognition but he is not seen as legitimate in much of Yemen. And splitting Yemen is an option. But it might not do anything to stop the war - two neighbouring countries embroiled in war is as bad as a civil war. Before such decisions are made, there must be peace.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154827474283641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154827474283641</a></p><p>Another article stating that the war will end if north and South Yemen divide. I disagree. That will just lead to an ongoing cross border war. And what about the differences between Aden and Hadramaut, Taiz and everyone else? The war has to stop before any decision can be made on the political future of Yemen. If there is to be a split, it has to be friendly or the violence will carry on.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154831172338641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154831172338641</a></p><p><strong>4.5.2016 – Middle East Eye (** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>The media misses the point on ‘proxy war’</strong></p><p>Yemen is a Saudi war of aggression, while Syria and Libya are the result of a dangerous Gulf-led strategy of backing groups of sectarian fighters.</p><p>The term “proxy war” has experienced a new popularity in stories on the Middle East. Various news sources began using the term to describe the conflict in Yemen immediately, as if on cue, after Saudi Arabia launched its bombing campaign against Houthi targets in Yemen on 25 March.</p><p>It is certainly time to discuss the problem of proxy war in the Middle East, because a series of such wars are the heart of the destabilisation and chaos engulfing the region. The problem with the recent stories featuring the term is that it is being used in a way that obscures some basic realities that some news media are apparently not comfortable acknowledging.</p><p>The real problem of proxy war must begin with the fact that the United States and its NATO allies opened the floodgates for regional proxy wars by the two major wars for regime change in Iraq and Libya. Those two profoundly destabilising wars provided obvious opportunities and motives for Sunni states across the Middle East to pursue their own sectarian and political power objectives through proxy war.</p><p>The fact that the news media began labelling Yemen a proxy war in response to the Saudi bombing strongly suggests that the term was a way of softening the harsh reality of Saudi aggression.</p><p>The assumption underlying that application of “proxy war” is, of course, that Iran had already turned Yemen into such a war by its support for the Houthis. But it ignores the crucial question of whether the Houthis had been carrying out “preponderantly foreign goals and foreign strategies”. Although Iran has certainly had ties with the Houthis, the Saudi propaganda line that the Houthis have long been Iranian proxies is not supported by the evidence.</p><p>Far from proving the Iranian proxy argument, the Houthi takeover of Sanaa last year has actually provided definitive evidence to the contrary. US intelligence sources recently <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/20/iran-houthis-yemen_n_7101456.html">told the Huffington Post</a> that before the Houthis entered the capital, the Iranians had advised against such a move.</p><p>So the Houthis clearly don’t intend to serve an Iranian strategy for Yemen.</p><p>The NBC story on a “regional proxy war” completely misses the seriousness of the problem. It turns its proxy war concept into an abstract and virtually antiseptic problem of limiting Iranian influence in the region through the US bombing Iraq. It ignores the fact that the regional actors behind the wars in Syria, Iraq and Libya are pulling the region into a new era of unbridled sectarian violence and instability.</p><p>Once it became clear that Sunni states were creating a proxy war in Syria that could tip the balance against the Syrian regime, Iran and Hezbollah intervened in support of the regime.</p><p>The media stories have offered only anodyne references to the problem of proxy war. What is needed in media coverage is a focus on the nasty realities of proxy war and their origins – by Gareth Porter</p><p><a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/media-misses-point-proxy-war-1956459570">http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/media-misses-point-proxy-war-1956459570</a></p><p>Comment: Great article which I missed in 2015.</p><p><strong>21.10.2016 – Almanar (** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Saudi Decisive Storm .. Scene Is Turned Upside down</strong></p><p>“If you quit, I quit”, an equation used by Saudis to summarize their war on neighboring Yemen, putting aside all the slogans of determination and firmness that were enameling the Kingdom’s newspapers for over 18 months. Saudis have raised the white flag, and he who declared the war on Yemen has gotten out of his box to spoke the kingdom’s desire to stop it after not only the failure to achieve its goals, but also having retroactive results.</p><p>Finally, Adel al-Jubeir uttered: “We want to stop the war,” Saudis tweeted after that: “We have lost.”</p><p>Two days ago, Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir expressed his country’s desire for a cease-fire in Yemen and knocked the ball in the court of Yemenis. Jubeir questioned the possibility of Yemeni commitment to the ceasefire in Yemen! Careful to abide by the cease-fire was nothing more than to ease the effect of the declaration of failure.</p><p>Since the beginning of the aggression on Yemen, Saudi ignored all the voices that came out to condemn the war and called for its cessation.</p><p>Recently, New York Times published a report about Minister Mohamad bin Salman, citing information from Saudi diplomats and princes of the royal family, in which it revealed that bin Salman’s decision to go for a war on Yemen without coordinating with any of the Saudi officials, although there was a debate among them about taking an action against Yemen.</p><p>It became clear that bin Salman claimed the aggression on Yemen from the first few hours. Upon the war started, Saudi media was mentioning bin Salman’s name as a “commander of Decisive Storm as he was taking photos with Saudi fighting forces here and there</p><p>Decisively, Saudi Arabia identified goals behind the war as follows:<br /> – To restore “legitimacy” that Saudi Arabia exclusively granted to a resigned president who does not represent the people in Yemen as far as he represents the image of Saudi influence in the country.<br /> – To withdraw Ansarullah group from the capital Sanaa and back to Saada.<br /> – To disarm Ansarullah.<br /> – Not to allow any role for former President Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen’s future.</p><p>After 18 months of aggression on Yemen, Saudi media reticent to mention the achievements of the Kingdom in the war. Muted Saudi media has been compensated by Saudi tweeters who commented on the recent Jubeir’s declaration in which he recalled the achievements of the Kingdom in Yemen.</p><p>Mojtahed, a Saudi activist on Twitter said: “The objectives of Decisive Storm was to take Houthis out to Saada and to hand their weapons over to the legitimate power which must return back to Sanaa, but it ended up as “if you quit, I quit.”</p><p>At the beginning of Decisive Storm, Jubeir was speaking like [Georges W.] Bush when he launched Operation Desert Storm. but today, he is speaking like Mahmoud Abbas in a tone of humiliation and degradation,” Turki bin Mohamad, third Saudi activist tweeted, commenting on Jubeir’s statements.</p><p>Even today, there is no clear official figures on the number of Saudis killed by the imposed war on Yemen, but there are figures published from time to time.</p><p>What about the financial cost which affects heavily the economic deficit of the Kingdom</p><p>The clearest expression of Saudi Arabia’s decline came by Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, who said in a tweet published in last May: “Whether we agree or disagree with the Houthis, they remain part of the social fabric of Yemen.”</p><p>Saudi Arabia has lost its war on Yemen. More precisely, Mohammed bin Salman has failed in the war on Yemen, which he employed in his battle for the throne. For the sake of the throne war between the al-Saud princes, tens of thousands of victims lost their lives, and Yemen has been destroyed with a lot of its cultural landmarks. Bin Salman recruited Saudi and Arab media to incite against Yemenis, and managed to kill the conscience of millions of people who did not turn a hair before the scenes of massacres and horrible killings.</p><p>However, he did not succeed in the most important battle: the battle to bring the Yemeni bowing to take bin Salamn to power over their dead bodies – by Israa al-Fass</p><p><a href="http://english.almanar.com.lb/73104">http://english.almanar.com.lb/73104</a></p><p><strong>21.10.2016 – The Saker (** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Yemen – an introduction to the forgotten conflict you so rarely hear about [A Who’s who with maps included]</strong></p><p>The Yemeni conflict is characterized by the asymmetric ways it’s being fought on the battlefield and by the massive amount of suffering for the civilian population in the impoverished country.</p><p>The presidency was essentially handed over in a one-man election, mandated by the Gulf Cooperation Council as Yemen’s first step in transition, to Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, who many Yemenis regard as a puppet of the United States. It is worthy of notice that Hadi was supposed to only serve for two years until new parliamentary and presidential elections were to be held in 2014, a deal he reneged on.</p><p>The Houthis have previously been accused of wanting to replace the republican system with an Islamic Republic modelled after that of Iran, something that the Houthis themselves have on several occasions denied with the main reason for this being the fact that they are a minority in the country. Hussein Al-Bukhari, a man close to the Houthis said that:</p><p>As the security situation in Yemen began to deteriorate, with the presence of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) ever growing stronger, and with their demands for the Yemeni government to act against this terrorist threat being ignored, the once small group in the highlands of Saadah sought to take their destiny into their own hands.</p><p>When comparing the Yemeni and Syrian tragedies, it is difficult to not feel disgusted. What is truly disgusting is the unlimited amount of hypocrisy and lies being spread by the Western “humanitarian” powers and their propaganda machines (mainstream media). The same powers who are outraged by Russia and Syria’s legitimate struggle to fight terrorism because of the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Aleppo, are the same ones who are currently imposing a 18 month long blockade on Yemen, resulting in mass starvation and the recent outbreak of cholera.</p><p>The same powers who are seeking “democracy and freedom” in Syria, are backing the most medieval and criminal regimes in modern times, namely the Gulf Monarchies, in their campaign to destroy its neighboring country.</p><p>The same powers who claim to fight terrorism are selling billions of dollars’ worth of arms to the Wahhabi kingdom who shares and exports the same vile and cruel ideology to the world in the form of ISIL and Al-Qaeda.</p><p>Yemen is paying a heavy price for its natural right to remain independent and free from foreign dominance, and while the Western media are outraged by the situation in Aleppo, they remain absolutely silent on Yemen’s suffering which is why so many people have no clue as to what’s going on in the country.

The most important is the civil war between Houthi and former president’s loyalist against the actual president forces and his international allies. The second war is between the various political and religious groups such as the socialist, radical Islamists, Al Qaeda, Sunni moderate and Zaydi Shia.</p><p>Mahdi said that during the last 30 years, Saudi Arabia has had a lot of influence over the Zaydi community in Yemen to the point where Zaydis and Sunnis are often combined.</p><p>“Zaydi is now mostly used not has on the religious ground, but tribal ground,” Mahdi said. “For some Zaydi is used as a religious way, tribal identity or even for political purpose such the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.”</p><p>To conclude on this information Mahdi said all these differences combined together make the Yemen conflict unique and not a one way war between Shia and Sunni and Iran and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“Sectarianism has never been a major issue for most of the Yemenis until recently,” Mahdi told</p><p>“This new Deputy Crown and pretender to the throne wanted to test his power and thought he could end it all in few strikes,” Mahdi said, noting they created more condition for terrorism.</p><p>Mahdi also said the Saudi government is seen as part of the conflict rather than a mediator, even their first official motivation was to re-instore the democracy in Yemen, which is “a joke” when one understands that Saudi Arabia not a democracy.</p><p>“What we see with the rise of the Houthis, Iran is getting somehow the upper hand,” Mahdi said adding it greatly increased the intervention of the Saudi in Yemen that consider this country has their backyard.</p><p>The US is also to blame in this conflict – by Oliver Rey</p><p><a href="http://www.reddirtreport.com/around-world/yemens-civil-war-another-syria-style-conflict-gestation">http://www.reddirtreport.com/around-world/yemens-civil-war-another-syria-style-conflict-gestation</a></p><p>Comment: Some background information, but Iran’s role exaggerated.</p><p>21.10.2016 – Haykal Bafana (B K)</p><p>We live in a world where journalists apparently no longer need to practice the profession of journalism.

This question is even more salient today given concerns raised about the quality of the Saudi coalition’s own investigations clearing itself of wrongdoing. It is also more relevant than ever given recent US military bombing of Houthi targets in Yemen.</p><p>While the US and UK provide arms and other support to the Saudis, their officials have been <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/10/263158.htm">at pains to stress</a> that their governments are not party to the Saudi-coalition’s armed conflict with the Houthis.</p><p>That line has become increasingly hard to draw with the recent<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-missiles-idUSKCN12C294">exchanges</a> of fire between the US and Houthi forces.

And yet, following the tragic incident in Sana’a, the United States decided to launch their own air strikes, consolidating the support they were already providing to the coalition. While the US National Security Council issued a statement noting that it was “deeply distressed” by the civilian casualties in the Sana’s attack, it has now become clear that the US does not intend to seriously reconsider its strategy in Yemen. This is particularly alarming given that the conflict does not lend itself to neat dichotomies between “good” and “evil” actors. A brief overview of the country’s troubled history provides a more nuanced understanding.</p><p>The protracted and multifaceted conflict in Yemen keeps claiming thousands of innocent lives, often forgotten or glossed over under the convenient label of ‘’collateral damage”, whilst the rise of al-Qaeda and ISIS shows no signs of regressing. To add to the already hopeless situation – Saudi Arabia is running for re-election to the Human Rights Council at the United Nations, after their current term expires this year, a position that the country has numerously used as a tool to obstruct any international inquiries on unlawful attacks against civilians in Yemen.

The last year and a half since the conflict began has compounded and exacerbated these pre-existing issues. Up to 20.4 million people are now in need of assistance related to WASH. Up to 9.4 million have suspended, reduced, or disrupted access to water largely as a result of fuel shortages. Around 2 million children are at risk of diarrhea because of poor access to water and poor sanitation environments. In response, ACTED launched interventions centred on providing comprehensive emergency WASH assistance with the following objectives:</p><p>On the other hand, ACTED’s intervention in Al Dhale’e governorate reached 22,404 beneficiaries with water filter distribution, hygiene kits and hygiene training, community water point rehabilitation, and WASH infrastructure rehabilitation in health facilities.</p><p>Lina is a 26-year-old computer scientist, who lives with her husband and two young boys in a small village in Jahaf district. Lina tells ACTED that the “impact of the crisis has been devastating” for her family. She has a BA in computer sciences, but since the war started in 2015, both she and her husband lost their jobs, leaving them without money for food and other basic items. As a result she sees her family’s health deteriorating. Lina tells ACTED that most people in her village are in a similar situation; they’ve also lost their jobs and their financial situations are dire. Equally, she says there is a shortage of water in the village and a shortage of fuel that is needed to run generators. Lina knows the water her family was drinking was not clean, but she also had no other options.</p><p>Until ACTED provided hygiene promotion training, hygiene kits and water filters to members’ of Lina’s community in late 2015 and early 2016, she says that there had been no other humanitarian assistance in the village.</p><p>Zahra lives with her family in a small village in Jahaf district. She has six sons and three daughters, although sadly, she tells ACTED that one of her sons was killed during the fighting in Al Dhale’e governorate. Zahra says that she has no formal education, and neither does her husband. Zahra tends cows and sheep for a living, and her husband gets his income from ad-hoc manual labour jobs, when he can find work.</p><p>Zahra says that since the war started, people in her village have experienced a severe water shortage, and that the water that is still available is not safe to use. Furthermore, Zahra reports that most people lost their jobs during the crisis, and that the price of staple food has risen a lot. Zahra mentions that because her and her husband don’t have enough money to meet her family’s basic needs, that diseases are spreading, and that her children often have diarrhea.</p><p>Before ACTED began trucking water to his community, Abdo says people were obligated to travel far distances to collect water for their homes on unsafe routes.</p><p><a href="http://www.acted.org/fr/node/13512">http://www.acted.org/fr/node/13512</a> =<a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/human-face-water-shortage-and-deteriorating-sanitation-yemen">http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/human-face-water-shortage-and-deteriorating-sanitation-yemen</a></p><p>Comment: That’s why cholera is spreading… Thank you, Saudi.</p><p>19.10.2016 – WHO (A H)</p><p>Only 45% of all health facilities in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a> remain functional due to shortages in health staff, medicines and medical supplies</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/whoyemen/status/788795125136781312">https://twitter.com/whoyemen/status/788795125136781312</a></p><p>19.10.2016 – WHO (A H)</p><p>WHO has trained epidemiological surveillance coordinators in 16 governorates on reporting, control &amp; prevention of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cholera?src=hash">#cholera</a> outbreak.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/whoyemen/status/788076316180570112">https://twitter.com/whoyemen/status/788076316180570112</a></p><p>More than 7.6m people are living in the affected areas, and over 3m IDPs are especially vulnerable to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cholera?src=hash">#cholera</a> outbreak in<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash">#Yemen</a> (photo)</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/whoyemen/status/788387128837308416">https://twitter.com/whoyemen/status/788387128837308416</a></p><p>Comment: Do not wonder about cholera if you see how people must take their drinking water.</p><p><a class="bootstrap_oembed" href="https://twitter.com/UNICEF_Yemen/status/788728736355155968">Eingebetteter Medieninhalt</a></p><p>19.10.2016 – Doctors Without Borders (* A H)</p><p>Om Halima of Osman valley, Amran, holding her malnourished two-month-old baby in her hands. She says that she does not find things to eat most of the time. Her husband has no regular income except for his daily work in markets. “He is not lucky much of the time. If he manages to find work, he comes back home carrying food, otherwise he comes back empty handed. This has happened many times." She adds "We couldn't hospitalize our baby when she started feeling sick but days later; we managed to borrow some money so we could bring her to the hospital." Halima has now been admitted to the malnutrition unit in Al-Salam Hospital. Her nurse says that her mother does not get enough food to be able to breastfeed her baby. The baby is below weight so we are taking care of her and giving her diluted milk f10 until she gains a normal weight.

We saw this just a few weeks ago in Syria, where a ceasefire crafted through diplomacy with the Russians was suddenly shattered by an “accidental” US attack on Syrian army positions.</p><p>It’s clear — clear beyond all reasonable doubt — that America’s militarist extremists are determined to subvert or destroy any attempt at peace that does not end in total American dominance. They can at times work subtly and patiently — witness the long, steady rehabilitation of the radical neocons of the Bush era, now openly embraced by the “progressive” Obama and Clinton — and, when possible, they prefer to work by proxy, to avoid stirring up the stupid herd of rubes (aka the American people) who supply the tax money and cannon fodder for their extremist agenda. But when they must, they will act swiftly, brutally and directly to kill moves toward peace. That’s what happened this week in Yemen.</p><p>Thus another proxy war slides into direct involvement, without any declaration or debate. Thus more and more civilians are slaughtered in the name of geopolitical power games, leaving behind anguished, grieving, angry survivors, prey to anyone who offers them a venue for retribution. All this, we’re told, is done in the name of “national security.” But here’s a question no one asks in the howling hell-circus of our presidential campaign: after 15 years of this, 15 years of “counterterror war” destroying entire nations, uprooting millions of people and killing multitudes of innocent people, 15 years of bipartisan policies which our own intelligence services have repeatedly said exacerbate “radicalization” terrorism at home and abroad — is our nation more secure? – by Chris Floyd</p><p><a href="http://www.smirkingchimp.com/thread/chris-floyd/69471/tonkin-2-0-attack-on-ships-justifies-us-escalation-in-yemen">http://www.smirkingchimp.com/thread/chris-floyd/69471/tonkin-2-0-attack-on-ships-justifies-us-escalation-in-yemen</a></p><p>21.10.2016 – Strategic Culture (* A L P)</p><p>US Wider Entanglement in Yemen Amid Deep Concern over War Crimes</p><p>The United States has kept warships in the region to guard a sea lane through which four million barrels of oil pass each day.

The Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) that Congress passed a few days after 9/11 allows the President to use force against groups and countries that had supported the attacks.

The foreign minister can speak for himself, but he was on the phone to his people back in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They confirmed to him their willingness to live by the ceasefire, but it is essential that the Houthi, who have said they will support this ceasefire, live by it. And regrettably, there were two civilians – Saudi civilians – killed by a missile that came from the Houthi into Saudi Arabia.</p><p>So any such breaches of this put at risk the entire possibility of getting back to talks. And I have talked today with the UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, who is in touch directly with all of the players, with our ambassador in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, to make sure that parties understand the stakes here. I talked with Yusuf bin Alawi, the foreign minister of Oman, and he will be in touch with other players. And I talked also earlier today with Foreign Minister Lavrov, who has – Russia is also supporting the idea of a ceasefire, and they have indicated their willingness to enforce this.</p><p>But let me make it clear: Saudi Arabia has a right to be free from missiles being launched from Yemen into Saudi Arabia. And the Houthi – we would call on them to draw their troops back, to draw their missiles back, which ultimately will have to be negotiated within the context of negotiations when they begin. But it is important for this ceasefire to be given time to try to take hold. And so there will be an infraction here or there. We all know that. But by and large today, violence has been significantly reduced, and the parties have indicated their willingness to try to live by this.</p><p>There is a center that has been arranged to be created, and the Saudis are already manning that center. We’re waiting for the Houthi to show up.</p><p>Jubeir: we discussed the situation in Yemen. As of this morning Washington time, there had been more than 150 violations by the Houthi-Saleh side in Taiz alone, which is an escalation in the violence rather than a reduction. After the cessation was announced and accepted by both Yemeni sides, there has been a missile launched into Saudi territory that – with casualties being a man and his daughter.</p><p>The de-escalation and coordinating committee that was set up in southern Saudi Arabia in a town called Dhahran South, to be manned by the two Yemeni sides and the United Nations to coordinate the de-escalation and the withdrawals and the disarmament has been manned by the Yemeni Government for weeks now, if not months, and we are still waiting for the Houthis to arrive. The legitimate Government of Yemen made this one of their requirements for a cessation of hostilities, so we hope that the Houthis and Saleh will send representatives there so they can begin the process of coordinating how to de-escalate and how to drop.</p><p>We, of course, reserve the right to protect our borders and to defend ourselves. We hope that the two sides in Yemen will continue to – will move towards the negotiating table in order to arrive at a negotiated settlement.</p><p><a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2016/10/263368.htm">http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2016/10/263368.htm</a></p><p>Comment: Kerry said Saudi Arabia “has a right to be free from missiles being launched from Yemen”.

Ted Lieu warned John Kerry in a new letter</p><p>Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., sent Kerry a letter last week calling for the U.S. to “cease immediately the aiding and abetting of” Saudi forces.</p><p>“The continuing civilian carnage caused by the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition in Yemen is horrifying,” Lieu wrote in the letter, a copy of which Salon received.</p><p>“It appears that either the Saudi coalition is intentionally targeting civilians or they are not distinguishing between civilians and military targets. Both would be war crimes,” he stressed.</p><p>“The frequency and scale of the civilian killings by the Saudi military coalition make it difficult to come to any conclusion other than that war crimes have been and are continuing to be committed in Yemen,” Lieu wrote.</p><p>“The repeated and frequent strikes on civilians show that the issue is not the gross incompetence of the Saudi military coalition,” he said. “Apologists for the Saudi coalition can perhaps defend a few errant bombs, but not over 70 unlawful airstrikes.”</p><p>In his letter, Lieu warned that the atrocities could help extremists. The U.S.-backed war has helped <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/04/19/iraq_all_over_again_al_qaeda_is_winner_of_u_s_backed_saudi_war_in_yemen_says_renowned_journalist/">al-Qaida grow in Yemen</a>, and even Islamic State forces have entered the country, seizing on the chaos.</p><p>“The aiding and abetting of Saudi airstrikes on civilians is a potential recruiting tool for terrorists,” Lieu wrote. “Every U.S. assisted bomb that kills children, doctors, patients, newlyweds and funeral mourners has the potential to amplify hatred towards the U.S.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Rep. Lieu released a statement condemning the attack on the funeral. “The Saudi-led military coalition has now essentially admitted to committing war crimes,” he said. “The civilian funeral ceremony was the intended target of the Saudi coalition.”</p><p>Lieu pointed out that even if rebel leaders had been present, “that would not justify an airstrike that targeted more than 650 civilians.” According to the law of armed conflict, military force cannot be used if it will cause disproportionate civilian casualties.</p><p>“This airstrike is yet another example of a disturbing pattern where the Saudi coalition drops bombs on civilian targets nowhere near military targets, or drops bombs killing a disproportionate number of civilians,” Lieu wrote. – by Ben Norton</p><p><a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/10/19/congressman-continues-pressuring-u-s-to-stop-aiding-civilian-carnage-in-saudi-led-war-in-yemen/">http://www.salon.com/2016/10/19/congressman-continues-pressuring-u-s-to-stop-aiding-civilian-carnage-in-saudi-led-war-in-yemen/</a></p><p>19.10.2016 – “White House Press Corps” (A E P)</p><p>National Debt on Jan 20, 2009.

What has not escalated is the Obama administration's authority to wage this imprudent war, which is by no possible stretch of legal imagination permitted by the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force the White House claims as <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-all-purpose-authorization-of-military-force/">flimsy legal cover</a> for its other undeclared and endless conflicts.</p><p>The newest development of American intervention is a series of skirmishes between Shiite Houthi rebels (the militants the Sunni Saudi-led and U.S.-supported coalition<a href="http://theweek.com/articles/587008/how-saudi-arabias-war-yemen-became-americas-shame">opposes</a>) and two U.S. Navy Destroyers.</p><p>In light of what is happening in Yemen, the ongoing U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia deserves serious reconsideration, particularly if there is any truth to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/11/podesta-leaks-show-clinton-email-linking-saudi-arabia-qatar-to-isis.html">the claim</a> in leaked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman that the Saudi government is "providing clandestine financial and logistic support" to the Islamic State group based on shared Sunni loyalties.

No, it is not. Arabia, not Saudi Arabia is. This is a great difference. Islam might be happy that “Saudi Arabia” not yet existed in the year 1 AH. – “a legitimate war in accord with international law”; not at all, had already been often explained, it simply is a WAR OF AGGRESSION. – also look at the comments in The Independent and be aware that Saudi Arabia is the greatest promotor of terrorism worldwide.</p><p>Comment: Would be hilarious but far too many Yemenis are dying under Saudis' lies and violence and we are just outraged by the monstruosity of the claim.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/posts/1140991429287219">https://www.facebook.com/LivingInYemenOnTheEdge/posts/1140991429287219</a></p><p>Comment by Judith Brown: This is a amazing bit of propaganda - after all it is well documented - including in Hillary Clinton's recently released emails - that Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been supporting ISIS. Saudi Arabia with its forms of Islam, internationally known as Wahhabism, and extremist militias have such similar ways of operating - the beheadings, the anti-Shiism, the curtailing of women's rights,the intolerance, the only difference is that Saudi has a monarchy and lots of oil. The funding of Wahhabi schools by Saudi Arabia all over the world has been concurrent with the rise in Islamic extremism. After all Al Qaeda was headed by a Saudi and most of the 9/11 operators were from Saudi.

It was critically a war of self-defense after the Houthis and Ali Abdullah Saleh and his forces overran the legitimate government of Yemen.<br /> This is an inconvenient truth that frankly Iran and the Houthis have capitalized on in terms of both inflating casualty figures and reporting misinformation. This narrative has received traction among some commentators in the US and members of Congress (notably Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Chris Murphy) who see the conflict in Yemen as purely a humanitarian crisis that Washington is aiding and abetting without seeing the bigger picture.</p><p>The myth that somehow the US could do more to bring an end to the conflict is naïve and distracts from the immediate challenge for Washington, the Houthis aren’t purely a challenge for the GCC but for the US. They are also a group Iran could use to their advantage with their conflict with Washington.</p><p>While the Houthis existed long before Iran, their position today in Yemen isn’t purely because of their collaboration with Ali Abdullah Saleh. This militant group continues to be armed and supported by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah – by Andrew J. Bowen</p><p><a href="http://www.arabnews.com/node/1000341/columns">http://www.arabnews.com/node/1000341/columns</a> =<a href="http://www.thefrontierpost.com/article/412926/">http://www.thefrontierpost.com/article/412926//</a></p><p>Comment: This really is hardcore propaganda from an US point of view, having internalised the whole Saudi propaganda. Of course, this is article an anti-Iran blame game. And much more: The Saudi war on Yemen is NO war of self-defense (Houthi attacks against Saudi territory started 10 weeks AFTER the Saudi air raids against Yemen); toppling a government in a neighbouring state does not create the scenario for any “war of self-defense” as the author suggests here. Why Turkey did not start bombing Athens after the 1967 Papadopoulos coup, or why did the Greeks not bomb Istanbul after the 1980 Evren coup? What about Russia would have bombed Kiew in February 2014? A really strange logic the author shows here.</p><p>Comment by Judith Brown: This is a very one sided account of the war - ignoring the US statement on USS Mason that the report of missiles may have been a mistake - talking about the new parliament in Sanaa - something that Hadi never did - as if it is a retrograde step though it's clear that it is what Yemenis in the north want and essential too as otherwise the north is an anarchic state - but worth reading to see what the other'side' see as their truth.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154829871858641">https://www.facebook.com/judith.brown.794628/posts/10154829871858641</a></p><p>20.10.2016 – AEI (A P)</p><p>Should the US turn the other cheek in Yemen?</p><p>It seems that there is a reluctance on the part of the White House, State Department, and Pentagon to blame Iran for orchestrating the attacks [against the US warships off Yemen]. This despite the fact that <a href="https://www.aei.org/publication/are-houthis-independent-of-iran/">Iran seems clearly responsible</a> for <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-iran-idUSKCN12K0CX">providing Yemen’s Houthis</a> with anti-ship missiles and training the militia in their use. (While Yemen has always been awash in weaponry, anti-ship missiles seldom played into tribal conflicts in its deserts and mountains).</p><p>The questions then become not only how, but against whom, should the United States retaliate? Does waiting a day or two before hitting a Houthi radar site sufficiently deter new incidents? Alternately, is the best path to peace simply to turn the other cheek to forestall a cycle of violence?</p><p>Back to the present: Simply turning the other cheek — whether against Islamist militants or against state sponsors of terror — does not bring peace. Sometimes, the best path to peace is by convincing the masterminds of terror that the buck stops with them and the price they will have to pay for targeting American forces is too great for them to bear.</p><p><a href="https://www.aei.org/publication/should-the-us-turn-the-other-cheek-in-yemen/">https://www.aei.org/publication/should-the-us-turn-the-other-cheek-in-yemen/</a></p><p>Comment: One more article of the US anti-Iran propaganda blame game, which already had been reported before, or see article below.
