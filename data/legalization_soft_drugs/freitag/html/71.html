Der Fotograf Lorenzo Tugnoli dokumentiert eine Seite des Jemenkriegs, die nur wenige zu sehen bekommen: den Alltag zwischen den Fronten.</p><p>"Ich stellte mir vor", sagt Tugnoli, "wie Menschen in <span><a href="https://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/themen/deutschland-4540700.html">Deutschland</a></span> reagieren würden, wenn in einem Krankenhaus ein Kind an einer Lungenentzündung stirbt." Aber der Jemen, sagt er noch, liege eben sehr weit weg. Seine Fotos sind ein Versuch, das Land ein bisschen näher zu holen. Es ist ein nicht endender Konflikt, der es im Westen nur noch in die Schlagzeilen schafft, wenn er überregionale Auswirkungen haben könnte. So wie jüngst, als es hieß, die Huthi hätten Saudi-Arabiens zentrale Ölraffinerie angegriffen. Und damit den Ölpreis. Doch auch wenn niemand in den Nachrichten über den Jemen spricht, geht dort alles weiter wie in den Jahren zuvor. Das Sterben. Der Hunger. Die Hilflosigkeit.</p><p>Von Beginn an gehörte es zur Strategie der Saudis, keine Journalisten in den Jemen zu lassen. Niemand sollte dokumentieren, was dieser Krieg anrichtet. Der italienische Fotograf Lorenzo Tugnoli ist einer der wenigen, denen es trotzdem gelungen ist, durch das Land zu reisen – zweimal, zum ersten Mal im Mai 2018. </p><p>Es gibt ein paar Formulierungen, die immer zu hören oder zu lesen sind, wenn es um den Jemen geht: "der vergessene Krieg" zum Beispiel oder auch: "die größte humanitäre Katastrophe der Welt". Hilflose Floskeln, die schon lange niemanden mehr aufrütteln.</p><p>Denn "die größte Katastrophe" findet in einem Land statt, in dem kaum ein Europäer je gewesen ist. Millionen Menschen sind auf der Flucht – aber raus aus dem Jemen schafft es fast keiner. Und nach Europa schon gar nicht.</p><p>Was die Männer, Frauen und Kinder aus ihrer Heimat vertreibt, ist kein typischer Krieg. Die meisten Opfer werden nicht in Gefechten getötet. Die schlimmste Waffe ist der Hunger. Bis Ende 2019, schätzt die UN, werden 102.000 Menschen in Kampfhandlungen umgekommen sein. Und weitere 131.000 durch Hunger oder die Folgen des Mangels – wie Seuchen und Infektionen. Es sind geschätzte Zahlen, weil die meisten Menschen in Gegenden umkommen, in denen niemand die Toten zählt.</p><p>Lorenzo Tugnoli kennt beide Seiten der Front im Land, er ist zu den Kämpfern der Huthi gefahren und zu denen ihrer Gegner. Er besuchte Flüchtlingslager, Märkte, Schulen. Er wollte zeigen, wie es im Jemen aussieht. Wie die Menschen leben. Die Momente einfangen, in denen aus dem Krieg ein einzelnes Schicksal wird: wenn ein Junge über den Schutt balanciert, der einmal ein Haus war. Wenn Menschen an einem Gemüsestand vorbeigehen und wissen, dass sie sich nicht mal eine Tomate leisten können.</p><p>Wenn eine junge Frau, Dschamila, in einem verlassenen Haus in Aden auf die Geburt ihres Kindes wartet.</p><p>In Aslam, im Nordwesten des Landes, hat Lorenzo Tugnoli eine Klinik für solche Kinder besucht. Er verbrachte zehn Tage dort. Jeden Morgen kamen sie an: Familien mit kleinen Jungen und Mädchen, deren Rippen sich unter der Haut abzeichneten. Tugnoli fotografierte eine Mutter, Fatima, die ihre Tochter Nada in eine Plastikschüssel hob, welche mit einem Seil an einer Waage befestigt war. "Alle Eltern wollten mir ihre Kinder zeigen", sagt er. "Sie wollten sie der Welt zeigen."</p><p>Der Jemen ist ein Land, in dem relativ wenig Geld viel erreichen könnte. Viel Leid könnte verhindert werden, wenn es nur genug internationalen Druck gäbe, einen Deal, eine gemeinsame Anstrengung – von Raphael Geiger (Fotos von Lorenzo Tugnoli)</p><p><span><a href="https://www.stern.de/politik/ausland/jemen--bilder-aus-einem-krieg--von-dem-die-welt-kaum-notiz-nimmt-8923726.html">https://www.stern.de/politik/ausland/jemen--bilder-aus-einem-krieg--von-dem-die-welt-kaum-notiz-nimmt-8923726.html</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp1 Am wichtigsten / Most important</span></h2><p><em>Siehe oben / Look above.</em></p><p><em>Südjemen / Southern Yemen. cp6</em></p><p><strong>(** B T)</strong></p><p><strong>“Their Fate is Tied to Ours”: Assessing AQAP Governance and Implications for Security in Yemen</strong></p><p>Executive Summary.</p><p>Global attention has for many years now been fixated on Islamic State and their governance project in Syria and Iraq – the most successful case globally which lasted from 2014 until early 2019. Yet, this was not the first instance of terrorist governance, nor is it likely to be the last. In fact, a growing number of jihadist groups appear to be engaging in various levels and<br /> aspects of governance in order to gain and maintain local support, particularly in areas with limited or troubled government presence. Governance has also proven to be a useful source of revenue and material gain for many of these groups, including for al‑Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen.</p><p>Starting in Yemen in 2011, AQAP conducted the first successful instances of prolonged al‑Qaeda governance in the cities of Jaar and Zinjibar – cities they held for over a year. Returning in 2015, the re‑seized these two cites. Most significantly, they held and administered the port city of Mukalla for over a year. Beyond this, numerous cases of small scale governance were recorded in Yemen up to 2017.</p><p>This report describes the evolution of AQAP governance, outlining how an initially severely repressive approach which engaged hudud punishments was reigned in, in favour of a more ‘hearts and<br /> minds’‑based approach. It also highlights unique aspects of this governance that were identified as lending to its success in cases such as Mukalla, such as the use of local actors to implement government administration, as well as effective and timely provision of social welfare and public works. Finally, it examines how and why these governance campaigns came to an end. This report holistically collates and analyses the most successful cases of AQAP governance in Yemen. It also highlights the many additional and often overlooked instances of small-scale governance that were less spectacular in nature.</p><p>This report is comprised of three sections. The first describes what jihadist governance is through a review of both jihadist governance and rebel governance in the literature. The second looks in depth at three key case studies between 2011 and 2016 to see what this governance looked like in practice: Jaar and Zinjibar; Rada; and Mukalla. Finally, it considers the implications of terrorist governance for actors seeking to counter and suppress the influence of these groups. It ultimately determines that the provision of key<br /> human security and social goods such as effective justice institutions; security; employment; and above all effective and accountable governance, are crucial to subverting local appeal for these groups.</p><p>Finally, it will highlight lessons drawn from the case of Yemen and consider other jihadist actors who have engaged in governance in other locations and suggests we have to examine this growing trend through a nuanced, full‑spectrum and long‑term approach.</p><p>From the Introduction.</p><p>Yemen proves to be an important and often overlooked case of such jihadist governance. To different extents and for differing lengths of time, al‑Qaeda’s local branch, al‑Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has implemented some form of governance in some parts of the country. The group has also notably adapted its actions and approach over the years. This was seen, for example, when it attempted to minimize the enforcement of Islamic punishment (which had brought much criticism), instead working to ‘correct’ what it viewed as un‑Islamic behaviour through more structured judicial means. It also began to provide extensive public services ranging from judicial to security in areas facing gaps in these public goods. As former AQAP leader Nasser al‑Wuhaishi noted, “providing these necessities will have a great effect on people, and will make them sympathize with us and feel that their fate is tied to ours.”</p><p><span><a href="https://icsr.info/2019/10/28/their-fate-is-tied-to-ours-assessing-aqap-governance-and-implications-for-security-in-yemen/">https://icsr.info/2019/10/28/their-fate-is-tied-to-ours-assessing-aqap-governance-and-implications-for-security-in-yemen/</a></span></p><p>Full report: <span><a href="https://icsr.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ICSR-Report-Their-Fate-is-Tied-to-Ours-Assessing-AQAP-Governance-and-Implications-for-Security-in-Yemen.pdf">https://icsr.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ICSR-Report-Their-Fate-is-Tied-to-Ours-Assessing-AQAP-Governance-and-Implications-for-Security-in-Yemen.pdf</a></span></p><p>Main findings: <span><a href="https://icsr.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ICSR-Infographic-Their-Fate-is-Tied-to-Ours-Assessing-AQAP-Governance-and-Implications-for-Security-in-Yemen.pdf">https://icsr.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ICSR-Infographic-Their-Fate-is-Tied-to-Ours-Assessing-AQAP-Governance-and-Implications-for-Security-in-Yemen.pdf</a></span></p><p><strong>(** B K P)</strong></p><p><strong>Britain’s secret Saudi military support programme</strong></p><p>The UK’s Ministry of Defence has mistakenly admitted for the first time the cost of a secret multibillion-pound programme it manages for the Saudi Arabian royal family’s de facto protection force, which is also active in the devastating war in Yemen.</p><p><span>It can also be revealed that this programme, which is embedded in the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MOD) but paid for by the Saudi regime, employs ten times more people than the British government publicly admits, raising questions about ministers misleading the parliament in Westminster.</span></p><p><span>The Saudi Arabia National Guard Communications Project (known as Sangcom) has operated since 1978, when the British government signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the authorities in Riyadh. The project provides military communications equipment to the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) but the MOU, which is itself secret, stipulates complete secrecy on the budget.</span></p><p><span>In July this year, however, the MOD advertised for the position of a Sangcom project manager based in Riyadh. The job was open only to male applicants and the advert stated: “The UK MOD SANGCOM Project Team is responsible for the delivery of a £2bn programme to modernise the Saudi Arabian National Guard’s communications network.”</span></p><p>This is the MOD’s first public acknowledgement of the size of Sangcom’s budget in its 40-year history and such a casual mistake is likely to infuriate its Saudi counterparts. As recently as March 2019, Labour MP Catherine West asked a parliamentary <span><a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2019-03-04/228072">question</a></span> about the programme’s budget and was told that it is “confidential to the two governments”.</p><p>It is understood that this £2-billion budget runs for 10 years and was agreed in February 2010. This new phase of the Sangcom project is 15 times larger than the previous agreement, worth £124-million and signed in 2004. </p><p>The MOD <span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/727618/CCS207_CCS0318104056-1_MOD_ARA_2017-18_-_Web_PDF.pdf#page=156">spends £1.4-billion per year</a></span> on its own IT and telecommunications systems.</p><p>An MOD spokesperson told us: “Information in this job advert was uploaded in error and it was subsequently taken down,” adding, “the budget is confidential to the two governments.”</p><p>But, in a further sign of unusually lax information management, the job advert, while being taken down on some sites after the MOD was alerted, is <span><a href="https://findonejob.com/2019/07/01/sangcom-c2-project-manager/">still available</a></span> on the internet. In addition, Sangcom’s financial controller <span><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/sam-ulhaq-ba79a01b">states</a></span> on the social network LinkedIn that he is “responsible for a budget of circa £1.6B”.</p><p>The White Army</p><p>Also known as the White Army, the Saudi Arabian National Guard comprises about <span><a href="https://www.army.mil/article/199012/army_builds_sustaining_military_partnership_with_saudi_arabia">130,000 troops</a></span> and acts as an internal security force separate from the regular Saudi army.

In 2018, a classified French intelligence report <span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/15/saudi-weapons-yemen-us-france/">noted</a></span> that two SANG brigades — about 25,000 men — were deployed along the border with Yemen. Major General Frank Muth of the US military also <span><a href="https://www.army.mil/article/199012/army_builds_sustaining_military_partnership_with_saudi_arabia">revealed</a></span> that a SANG

Is the division of Yemen a reality?</p><p>Saudi Huthi understandings<br /> In parallel with the agreement on the south, Saudi Arabia is seeking an agreement to stop the war between the two sides on the border, according to sources in the Houthi administration, Saudi Arabia has offered to stop the war on the border.</p><p>This comes days after the source of the island's talk about a contact between Khalid bin Salman, Deputy Defense Minister of Saudi Arabia, the head of the Supreme Political Council of the Houthis Mahdi Mashat.</p><p>The Houthi source, who preferred to remain anonymous, said the group wants to reach full understandings with the Saudi side, including a comprehensive ceasefire agreement, based on parity, lifting the siege and restoring what was destroyed by the war.</p><p>He pointed out that the negotiations between the two sides did not start until the moment, as the group offered a list of guarantees for the success of the negotiations, including the immediate cessation of air strikes and the opening of airports and ports, but the Saudis did not respond.</p><p>He explained that one of those guarantees is that Saudi Arabia will not intervene in the problems of the Yemenis, "but what happened is the opposite, as the aggression aircraft launched intensive raids up to fifty raids on the border areas."</p><p>The source declined to elaborate further on these understandings, saying only that "we are dealing with facts on the ground.</p><p>Although military developments pose a threat to the truce between the Houthis and the Saudis, sources told Al-Jazeera earlier that a party in the Houthi group does not want to achieve a truce and a ceasefire agreement between the two sides.</p><p>Agreement to divide Yemen<br /> But political observers say Saudi Arabia's signing of an agreement with the Houthis is an affirmation of the division of Yemen, and a failure of Riyadh's war in Yemen since March 2015, whose main goal was to restore the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi.</p><p>Maan Damaj, a professor of philosophy at Sanaa University, told Al-Jazeera Net that contacts between the Saudis and the Houthis have been going on for the first year since the war.Huthi spokesman and head of delegation to the peace consultations Mohammed Abdul Salam Dhahran visited southern Saudi Arabia for more than a month.</p><p>The Yemeni political analyst pointed out that a settlement between the two parties may not be possible, and the closest vision would be to bring about a calm on the border and turn the entire war into an internal war in Yemen, which increases the risk of dividing the country.</p><p>He said that the division of the country will be imposed as a fait accompli without formal division, as there are no national forces may stand in front of what is happening.</p><p><span><a

Maud Bellon, Humanity &amp; Inclusion’s head of mission, explains the unacceptable situation civilians are facing on a daily basis.</p><p>"Since Humanity &amp; Inclusion launched a response in 2015, we have provided rehabilitation sessions to nearly 22,000 people," Maud explains. “We’ve distributed 23,600 mobility aids—including wheelchairs and crutches—along with special equipment. We have also fitted more than 200 people with prosthetics and orthotics.”</p><p>Since half of the country’s health facilities are no longer operational, all patients are transferred to medical facilities that have space for them. “There’s a constant flow of patients, from people injured in the conflict or car accidents, to older people and people with disabilities who need rehabilitation care. Many people need help because the country is in total chaos.”</p><p>Families cover long distances to be treated in Sana'a (North) or Aden (South), despite the risks facing travelers in Yemen, which include fighting, violence, crime and poor transport conditions due to blocked roads.</p><p>Yemenis are exhausted by four years of war that has destroyed the country’s social and economic structure. Psychosocial support remains a challenge in a country where the idea of psychological distress is given little credence.</p><p>"Humanity &amp; Inclusion’s team provided psychological support to more than 16,000 people, including direct beneficiaries of rehabilitation sessions and their caregivers.

When Ali’s father met the lawyer who helped his son, he approached the man and kissed him on the forehead as a sign of respect and gratitude, and he smiled while thanking him to return his child safe to him.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/yemen/stories/justice-children-yemen">https://www.unicef.org/yemen/stories/justice-children-yemen</a></span></p><p><span>(B H)</span></p><p><span>UN Children's Fund, Nutrition Cluster: </span>Yemen: Nutrition Cluster Dashboard, January to September 2019</p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-sam-gap-analysis-30-sept-2019">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-sam-gap-analysis-30-sept-2019</a></span></p><p><span>and</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-plw-am-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-plw-am-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-mnp-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-mnp-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-mam-u5-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-mam-u5-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-iycf-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-iycf-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-bsfp-u2-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-bsfp-u2-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-bsfp-plw-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019">https://reliefweb.int/map/yemen/yemen-nutrition-cluster-bsfp-plw-gap-analysis-30-sep-2019</a></span></p><p><span>(* B H)</span></p><p><span><a href="https://reliefweb.int/organization/unfpa">United Nations Population Fund</a></span>: UNFPA Response in Yemen: Monthly Situation Report #09 September 2019</p><p>The humanitarian crisis in Yemen remains the worst in the world.

defeat of UAE ambitions at Southern Yemen.</p><p>(* B K P)</p><p>A special report tries to answer this question. How and why did the UAE withdraw from southern Yemen?</p><p>Although the UAE's move to withdraw from southern Yemen is seen as part of a plan to redeploy Saudi and Emirati forces in cities in southern Yemen, the UAE's motives for withdrawing from the city were already present before the outbreak of fighting between the Southern Transitional Council forces and the forces of the Southern Transitional Council on the one hand. Government on the other hand.</p><p>In August, Saudi Arabia was hit by a major attack on Aramco oil refinery. The quality, timing and means of the attack clearly indicated Iranian fingerprints, but the Houthis were quick to embrace the process.</p><p>However, the UAE feels that their continued presence within the coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen may make them a future target similar to the attacks on Saudi Arabia, especially since the targeting of the two plants located far from the Yemeni-Saudi border confirms that the conflict has begun to expand into regionally, Iran can strike sensitive areas within the UAE in the name of the Houthis, who could claim responsibility, as happened with the Saudi attacks.</p><p>Iran has military bases and presence on the islands of Greater and Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, the UAE islands occupied by Tehran, which are located close to UAE territory.</p><p>These concerns prompted Abu Dhabi to take remarkable steps toward rapprochement with Iran; A recent visit to Tehran by Mohammed bin Zayed's brother, Tahnoun.</p><p>Improving reputation in the West</p><p>With the UAE's presence in the Yemeni file, I also attended the periodic reports issued by local and international human rights organizations on the humanitarian situation within the liberated provinces, which proved the involvement of Emirati and local forces trained and funded by the UAE in torture of prisoners and the execution of physical and verbal attacks on opponents in Aden and other southern provinces, as well as assassinations.</p><p>Although the UAE has funded local activists and human rights organizations in Aden to deny the charges, the torture file has become a fait accompli, and prisoners and detainees released have confirmed physical and psychological torture and said others have been sexually assaulted, while prisoners and activists have leaked videos, photographs show some of the situation inside the UAE prisons.</p><p>Local activists, government officials and previously released detainees accuse hardline leaders of the Southern Transitional Council, most notably Hani Ben Brik, of being behind the assassinations of dozens of activists, politicians and clerics in the city as a result of their opposition to the UAE's policy. Her man, Ben Brik, feared that the rejectionist voices would influence the UAE's strategy in Aden.</p><p>For all this, the UAE hopes that its withdrawal will help alleviate the pressures and campaigns it is facing internationally because of this file, as it seeks to get rid of the political and humanitarian pressures left by this presence and participate in the war, which was punctuated by raids that have claimed the lives of many civilians in different areas of Yemen.</p><p>Although much of the accusations about the raids that have claimed civilian lives are focused on Saudi Arabia, the UAE's active role in the coalition has become more of a concern than a great benefit to it.</p><p>A new strategy</p><p>The UAE has come to realize that its direct presence in Yemen in general, and in the cities of southern Yemen in particular, will increase the pressure on it in the military, political and humanitarian aspects, and this seems to be a significant factor in its use of the option of empowering its allies rather than on the ground.</p><p>Abu Dhabi has sent a clear message to its allies in the "transitional" since it began announcing the reduction of its military presence to stabilize its presence in the southern provinces just before the actual implementation of its withdrawal from the southern provinces and now the withdrawal process seems to coincide with the process of joining the Transitional Council into the government It is to be announced after the signing of the forthcoming Jeddah Agreement, which could be the UAE's new strategy of presence by local allies.</p><p><span><a href="https://almasdaronline.com/articles/173391">https://almasdaronline.com/articles/173391</a></span></p><p>(* A K P)</p><p>After years of being under the domination of the UAE.

Three factors shape their relationship: 1) Sunni-Shia disagreement, 2) the rivalry to be the regional power in the Middle East, and 3) the politics in the OPEC. The execution of Saudi's Shia cleric, Shaikh Nimr al-Nimr, is a continuing phenomenon of the protracted conflict between the two countries. The study found that the root cause of their foreign policy crisis is their rivalries for hegemonic ambition in the Middle East and a quest for leadership in the Muslim world. The sectarian divide between Sunni and Shia plays the most important role to ignite the hatred throughout the region. The impact of the execution was tense, whereby Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States cut diplomatic ties with Iran as a response to the burning of Saudi's diplomatic places by a group of Iranians. However, the tendency toward a war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is unlikely because the highest-level of policymakers of the two countries are rational. They fully realize that if they waged war against each other, the result would be a catastrophe, not only in the region but to the entire world.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/31607531/Saudi_Arabia_Irans_Foreign_Policy_Crisis_A_Case_Study_of_Execution_of_Saudi_Shia_Cleric_Shaikh_Nimr_al-Nimr?email_work_card=view-paper">https://www.academia.edu/31607531/Saudi_Arabia_Irans_Foreign_Policy_Crisis_A_Case_Study_of_Execution_of_Saudi_Shia_Cleric_Shaikh_Nimr_al-Nimr?email_work_card=view-paper</a></span></p><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran: The Tale of Two Media</p><p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/9372473/Saudi_Arabia_and_Iran_the_Tale_of_Two_Media?email_work_card=view-paper">https://www.academia.edu/9372473/Saudi_Arabia_and_Iran_the_Tale_of_Two_Media?email_work_card=view-paper</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp8 Saudi-Arabien / Saudi Arabia</span></h2><p><span>(* B P)</span></p><p><span>Saudi Arabia pardons convicted soldiers to keep them in Yemen fronts: Report</span></p><p>Saudi authorities have reportedly pardoned army soldiers convicted of various crimes in the ultra-conservative kingdom in order to encourage them to stay in battle fronts and fight against Yemeni army forces and their allies from Popular Committees.</p><p><a href="http://mirat0034.mjhosts.com/36043/">Arabic-language Mirat al-Jazeera news website</a>, citing a report published by the Arabic-language Saudi Arabian daily newspaper <em>Okaz</em>, reported on Monday that the Public Prosecutor's Office has found soldiers from the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF), the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) as well as command centers in Yemen eligible for receiving the clemency by relevant judicial officials.</p><p>The report added that the offer does not apply to troops found guilty by courts of crimes against national security and grave offenses.</p><p>Observers and juridical experts argue that the directive aims to pardon Saudi soldiers involved in the war against Yemen, who have criminal records and are convicted of criminal acts in different regions of the conflict-plagued country.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/10/28/609786/Saudi-Arabia-grants-troops-clemency-to-stop-them-from-fleeing-Yemen-fronts-Report">https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/10/28/609786/Saudi-Arabia-grants-troops-clemency-to-stop-them-from-fleeing-Yemen-fronts-Report</a> </span></p><p><span>(A P T)</span></p><p>An official source at Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The Kingdom appreciates the efforts of the US administration in eliminating the leader of Daesh terrorist organization</p><p><span><a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=1987577">https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=1987577</a></span></p><p><span>(A)</span></p><p>The Space Discovery event set to inspire young Saudis</p><p>The exhibition comes in line with Vision 2030, aiming to empower youngsters to gain knowledge of advanced technologies</p><p>RIYADH: The Space Discovery event was inaugurated in Riyadh on Thursday as part of the most significant entertainment season in the Kingdom.

But Parliament’s main mechanism for overseeing the industry, the Committees on Arms Export Controls, is “paralysed” by problems of its own</p><p>The Committees on Arms Export Controls – comprised of the Foreign Affairs, International Trade, Defence and International Development committees – appears to be the obvious body to scrutinise Government activity on contentious arms exports. But despite receiving a letter from Truss admitting the errors in September, the Committees – known as CAEC (pronounced ‘cake’) – have not met. In fact, CAEC has not held a session since May, and there are currently no scheduled meetings.</p><p>So what’s behind CAEC’s difficulties? And how can Parliament ensure the arms export industry is properly scrutinised? </p><p>CAEC’s chair, Labour MP Graham Jones, attributes the group’s difficulties to the “partisan” approach of some who are more interested in “scoring points over the other side” than in a serious inquiry into the role of British arms exports in the conflict. “I think the problem in the past was that the debate starts out from a very partisan basis. Of course, then there isn’t the basis to go forward,” he says. “It has had the catastrophic effect of paralysing the committee and the committee stopped functioning.” </p><p>Russell-Moyle agrees that political divisions means they inevitably reach a verdict of the “lowest common denominator”.</p><p>This was demonstrated in 2015 when, in a highly unusual move, CAEC’s inquiry into the use of manufactured arms in Yemen produced two separate reports – one from the Foreign Affairs committee, and another from the International Development committee and what was then the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee. The Defence committee was absent from both.</p><p>The chair believes CAEC’s problems can be overcome with a more rigorous approach to evidence and expert testimony. “I don’t want the committee to be focused simply on ‘Saudis buy bombs from Britain and drop them in Yemen,’” he says. “I have no intention of having an inquiry that starts with a partisan view, quite the opposite. I want to understand why there’s a civil war. What’s driving the conflict?”</p><p>One thing that’s certain is that as the UK looks towards its place in a rapidly changing world order, arms exports will remain an area of fierce contention. Whatever happens, Parliament will have to ensure this industry is scrutinised in an effective and meaningful way. – by Guinevere Poncia</p><p><span><a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/house/house-magazine/107583/arms-trade-committee-paralysed-partisanship">https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/house/house-magazine/107583/arms-trade-committee-paralysed-partisanship</a></span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cp12 Andere Länder / Other countries</span></h2><p><span>(A P)</span></p><p>Influencerin postet Dubai-Bilder – Kritik von Amnesty</p><p>Schwedin Kenza Zouiten Subosic ließ ihre 1,9 Millionen Follower auf Instagram an ihrem Familienurlaub teilhaben.
