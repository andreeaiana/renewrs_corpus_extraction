The project rethinks long-held assumptions about the form that the peace process should take. Instead of resorting to top-down centralized frameworks with regards to peace-making efforts, the project seeks to identify otherwise under-represented parties for inclusion in any renewed and potentially restructured peace process.

Import restrictions and the currency crisis have weakened the ability of Hadramis to meet their basic needs. Non-state armed groups including AQAP have taken advantage of broad destabilization and remain active in the inland areas of Wadi Hadramawt.

Marib locals have identified a number of mechanisms to lessen the pressure on public services and turn the burgeoning population of displaced Yemenis into an economic opportunity. However, to put these mechanisms into practice they require technical and material assistance from international and regional partners.", "In order for Marib to become a cornerstone of stability in Yemen, moreover, Marib needs greater representation both within Yemen\u2019s central government and in the peace process.
