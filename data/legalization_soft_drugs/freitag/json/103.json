Sudanese paramilitary forces have been fighting in the Yemeni civil war because of their dire economic problems at home and their need to earn an income. The Arab Persian Gulf states in the coalition have been compensating Sudanese mercenaries and child soldiers up to $10,000 each to enter the fight, essentially as cannon fodder in a conflict that has produced the world\u2019s worst ongoing humanitarian crisis. This practice has kept the number of Saudi and Emirati casualties relatively low but at the expense of hundreds of Sudanese who have lost their lives in this war.", "Many of the Sudanese fighters in Yemen come from the Janjaweed (armed horsemen) militias made up of ethnic Arabs from western Sudan, eastern Chad, and the Central African Republic (CAR)", "Joining the Arab coalition served Bashir\u2019s geopolitical interests, particularly after the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) crisis broke out in May/June 2017", "Yet Bashir\u2019s decision to keep Sudan in the Arab coalition was one factor that contributed to the end of his three-decade rule in April.

It also makes specific recommendations to Western policymakers addressing these types of sub-economies in detail.", "This report expands this discourse by incorporating approaches adopted from the literature on the political economy of war to examine the conflict economies of Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen.", "Economic motivations, at the individual and group level, are key to understanding the wars in these countries, yet have tended to be overlooked in the MENA context. (As the wars have progressed and evolved, the national and local economies in which conflict is embedded have also changed.) Such motivations can offer an alternative or complementary explanation for armed group membership and armed group behaviour. While some groups will fight to promote or defend a particular identity, others fight for economic survival or enrichment. For many more actors, these motivations are tied together, and separating out \u2018greed\u2019 and \u2018grievance\u2019 is a difficult, if not impossible, task. Even if economic motivations did not spark the wars in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen initially, it is clear that such factors now play a critical role in the persistence of open fighting, localized violence and coercion.", "The objectives of this report are twofold. First, it seeks to develop a framework for comparative analysis of conflict economies at the local level in the MENA region. Traditionally, the idea of a conflict economy has been tightly linked to the funding for arms, ammunition and fighters. Further, most analyses of conflict economies are conducted at the national level. Even where research is conducted on a regional basis, discussion of the impact of conflict is brought back to the national level. In contrast, we see a broader political economy of war at work in the region. Our analysis illustrates how a conflict economy is embedded within a complex local socio-political system, in which many variables and agendas interact. We deliberately avoid characterizing conflict economies in terms of \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018grey\u2019 markets that somehow need to be \u2018cleaned up\u2019, as this erroneously implies that they can eventually be converted into licit markets like their peacetime counterparts. A more nuanced and multifaceted reading is essential. For the purposes of this report, we define a conflict economy as a system of producing, mobilizing and allocating resources to sustain competitive and embedded violence, both directly and indirectly.", "Second, we show that a \u2018political economy of war\u2019 framing offers new approaches for reducing competitive and embedded violence. \u2018Competitive violence\u2019 can be defined as violence \u2018deployed by warring elites to contest or defend the existing distribution of power\u2019. Fighting between rival armed groups for control over resources and rents, among other things, usually falls into this category. \u2018Embedded violence\u2019, in contrast, underpins \u2018how a political settlement works, as the deals agreed between elites may revolve around who has the \u201cright\u201d to use violence\u2019. In practice, this could mean that one group is \u2018permitted\u2019 to use violence against another group \u2013 and no punishment will be enforced. In the context of this study, the use of armed force to assert the status quo to limit the number of ruling elite members is one example of embedded violence \u2013 by Tim Eaton, Dr Renad Mansour,Peter Salisbury, Dr Lina Khatib,Christine Cheng and Jihad Yazigi", "https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/conflict-economies-middle-east-and-north-africa", "and full report: https://reader.chathamhouse.org/chhj6854-war-economies-epub#executive-summary", "(** B K P)", "U.K. Court Nixes Saudi Arms Sales\u2013What it Means for the US and Other EU Countries", "The Court of Appeal of England and Wales issued a landmark ruling June 20 on the U.K.\u2019s decision to continue licensing arms sales \u2014 and its failure to suspend existing licenses \u2014 to Saudi Arabia, given the conduct of Saudi Arabia in the Yemen conflict.", "The court ruled, in essence, that in making decisions on arms sales, the U.K. government could no longer ignore uncomfortable facts.", "The evidence is clear: The coalition has repeatedly carried out indiscriminate and disproportionate airstrikes, failed to take appropriate precautions, and failed to credibly investigate. Yet, arms continued to flow from the U.K., as well as from the United States, France, Spain, Italy and others.", "Assessing Past Violations", "The central question before the Court of Appeal was whether the Secretary of State could rationally decide not to assess individual past violations in an estimation of the risk of future violations and remain in compliance with domestic and EU rules on arms exports. The Court of Appeal clearly answered this question in the negative.", "But the court\u2019s decision on process is important \u2014 extremely so. The decision strongly endorses the existing guidance in Section 2.13 of the User\u2019s Guide: That, in assessing \u201cclear risk,\u201d states should include, amongst other important inquiries, an examination of \u201cthe recipient\u2019s past and present record of respect for international humanitarian law.\u201d To the Court, this is a necessary component of any arms-licensing decision.", "In other words, the ruling would require the U.K. to incorporate assessments of laws-of-war compliance by partners to whom it is exporting military materiel. Regularizing the review of international humanitarian law compliance by partners is a crucial means of making those laws more effective (and thus more meaningful for civilians for whom harm is meant to be minimized by these provisions).", "In the Yemen context, a review of this nature would bring much-needed and long-overdue scrutiny to the conduct of the Saudi/U.A.E.-led coalition by the official entities of its allies, who in many cases serve as the coalition\u2019s enablers. Such reviews should necessarily involve scrutiny of the recipient state\u2019s response to violations. In the case of Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., and other coalition members, the response has been marked by denial and excuse.", "Other EU Members and the United States", "For other EU members, particularly those that have yet to suspend arms licenses to Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and their coalition partners, the judgment \u2013 although not legally binding on other EU states \u2013 makes a compelling case (with much of its reasoning grounded in the same test as set out in the EU Common Position and the User\u2019s Guide) that they, too, must assess the coalition\u2019s record in Yemen, and cannot turn a blind eye to past abuses when granting arms licenses if seeking to comply with the EU Common Position.", "The U.S. Congress, in its ongoing battle with the Trump Administration on the issue of arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., might consider legislating something similar for U.S. domestic law \u2013 by Kristine Beckerle and Dearbhla Minogue", "https://www.justsecurity.org/64664/u-k-court-nixes-saudi-arms-sales-what-it-means-for-the-us-and-other-eu-countries/", "and", "(** B K P)", "Britain\u2019s arms sales to Saudi Arabia may have been ruled \u2018unlawful\u2019 \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll stop", "As well as the question of what the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision means for existing equipment, there is a little faith in a paradigm shift in attitudes given the two frontrunners for the Conservative leadership, both of whom have signed off on arms contracts in the past", "The court\u2019s decision does not mean Britain must immediately halt arms exports to Saudi Arabia.", "For now, the UK cannot grant any new export licences to sell arms to the kingdom but the existing licenses and contracts will continue, pending a decision by the secretary of state.", "One of the judges, Sir Terence Etherton, said the ruling did not require the suspension of arms exports to Saudi Arabia but the government \u201cmust reconsider the matter\u201d and estimate any future risks.", "Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has already said the government would challenge the Court of Appeal ruling.

(As the wars have progressed and evolved, the national and local economies in which conflict is embedded have also changed.) Such motivations can offer an alternative or complementary explanation for armed group membership and armed group behaviour. While some groups will fight to promote or defend a particular identity, others fight for economic survival or enrichment. For many more actors, these motivations are tied together, and separating out \u2018greed\u2019 and \u2018grievance\u2019 is a difficult, if not impossible, task. Even if economic motivations did not spark the wars in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen initially, it is clear that such factors now play a critical role in the persistence of open fighting, localized violence and coercion.", "The objectives of this report are twofold. First, it seeks to develop a framework for comparative analysis of conflict economies at the local level in the MENA region. Traditionally, the idea of a conflict economy has been tightly linked to the funding for arms, ammunition and fighters. Further, most analyses of conflict economies are conducted at the national level. Even where research is conducted on a regional basis, discussion of the impact of conflict is brought back to the national level. In contrast, we see a broader political economy of war at work in the region. Our analysis illustrates how a conflict economy is embedded within a complex local socio-political system, in which many variables and agendas interact. We deliberately avoid characterizing conflict economies in terms of \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018grey\u2019 markets that somehow need to be \u2018cleaned up\u2019, as this erroneously implies that they can eventually be converted into licit markets like their peacetime counterparts. A more nuanced and multifaceted reading is essential. For the purposes of this report, we define a conflict economy as a system of producing, mobilizing and allocating resources to sustain competitive and embedded violence, both directly and indirectly.", "Second, we show that a \u2018political economy of war\u2019 framing offers new approaches for reducing competitive and embedded violence. \u2018Competitive violence\u2019 can be defined as violence \u2018deployed by warring elites to contest or defend the existing distribution of power\u2019. Fighting between rival armed groups for control over resources and rents, among other things, usually falls into this category. \u2018Embedded violence\u2019, in contrast, underpins \u2018how a political settlement works, as the deals agreed between elites may revolve around who has the \u201cright\u201d to use violence\u2019. In practice, this could mean that one group is \u2018permitted\u2019 to use violence against another group \u2013 and no punishment will be enforced.

(As the wars have progressed and evolved, the national and local economies in which conflict is embedded have also changed.) Such motivations can offer an alternative or complementary explanation for armed group membership and armed group behaviour. While some groups will fight to promote or defend a particular identity, others fight for economic survival or enrichment. For many more actors, these motivations are tied together, and separating out \u2018greed\u2019 and \u2018grievance\u2019 is a difficult, if not impossible, task. Even if economic motivations did not spark the wars in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen initially, it is clear that such factors now play a critical role in the persistence of open fighting, localized violence and coercion.", "The objectives of this report are twofold. First, it seeks to develop a framework for comparative analysis of conflict economies at the local level in the MENA region. Traditionally, the idea of a conflict economy has been tightly linked to the funding for arms, ammunition and fighters. Further, most analyses of conflict economies are conducted at the national level. Even where research is conducted on a regional basis, discussion of the impact of conflict is brought back to the national level. In contrast, we see a broader political economy of war at work in the region. Our analysis illustrates how a conflict economy is embedded within a complex local socio-political system, in which many variables and agendas interact. We deliberately avoid characterizing conflict economies in terms of \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018grey\u2019 markets that somehow need to be \u2018cleaned up\u2019, as this erroneously implies that they can eventually be converted into licit markets like their peacetime counterparts. A more nuanced and multifaceted reading is essential. For the purposes of this report, we define a conflict economy as a system of producing, mobilizing and allocating resources to sustain competitive and embedded violence, both directly and indirectly.", "Second, we show that a \u2018political economy of war\u2019 framing offers new approaches for reducing competitive and embedded violence. \u2018Competitive violence\u2019 can be defined as violence \u2018deployed by warring elites to contest or defend the existing distribution of power\u2019. Fighting between rival armed groups for control over resources and rents, among other things, usually falls into this category. \u2018Embedded violence\u2019, in contrast, underpins \u2018how a political settlement works, as the deals agreed between elites may revolve around who has the \u201cright\u201d to use violence\u2019. In practice, this could mean that one group is \u2018permitted\u2019 to use violence against another group \u2013 and no punishment will be enforced.
