This is a propaganda victory, pure and simple, for Yemen. That is why Yahya Sarih, the spokesman of the Houthis, has been appearing on TV with a military uniform as if they have won. That is why Al-Mayadeen which is sympathetic to the Iranian-backed alliance of Hezbollah, Syria\u2019s regime and the Houthis, has broadcast video of the men captured.

It is why Fars News in Farsi has broadcast the same video of the captured men being paraded away from the battlefield, looking more like French at Dienbienphi surrendering to the Vietnamese, than a modern war. The idea is to humiliate. Video shows anti-tank guided missiles being used against Oshkosh armored vehicles.

Nor would the Russian S-400 system cheekily offered by Putin in the aftermath of the attack have fared better, and for many of the same reasons.", "Such realities have found little place in the outpouring of commentary on the attacks, with little or no attention paid to easily available evidence.
