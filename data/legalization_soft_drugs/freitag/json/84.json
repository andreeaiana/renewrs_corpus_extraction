The elder brother told Amnesty that he and his sibling were playing with the bomblets for several hours when one exploded, killing the younger one instantly and injuring the 11-year-old. The older brother lost three fingers, needed an operation to insert steel plates into his shattered jaw and sustained shrapnel injuries to his chest and legs. He said:", "\u201cWe go down every day to the valley to herd goats, where there are many small bombs. We found four of them in the morning \u2026 they were cylindrical with a red ribbon. We carried them with us while herding. At around 1pm, I started to take the red string with my right hand and pull and [my brother] pulled on the other end of it and then it went off and I fell back.

The surviving brother told Amnesty:", "\u201cI found the bomb and I went and gave it to [my brother] so he can have one and I had one. Ali hit them against each other and they exploded and I found myself lying on the ground. The explosion pushed me back [several metres]. Two or three days before the accident, my friend and I used to go and collect the bombs and put them in a bag and hide them under and between the trees. They have a white ribbon.\u201d", "His 12-year-old brother was killed on the spot, with his abdomen torn open and his arm severed.

Other goat herders told Amnesty that the prevalence of bomblets in grazing areas has forced them to keep their goats locked up and feed them straw, which is costly and unsustainable. In most cases, farmers and herders told Amnesty they had no choice but to work in areas affected hit by cluster bombs despite the risks.", "Amnesty also interviewed a 13-year-old boy who was injured in January after apparently picking up a bomblet near a spring that locals rely on for water in a small village surrounded by agricultural land in al-Safra, Sa\u2019da governorate, some 15 miles from the Saudi Arabia border.

He says there are still submunitions by the spring.", "In many instances, civilians told Amnesty that they have had to resort to removing bomblets themselves, fearing that children will pick them up or their livestock be killed. Hindi Ibrahim, a 25-year-old father of two from Dugheij Village, Hayran, Hajjah governorate, told Amnesty how his arm was injured by an explosion when he and other villagers attempted to clear hundreds of bomblets from their village:", "\u201cThe original airstrike happened late last July or August during the day and [some of] the bomblets exploded. There were also Apaches [helicopters] that shot at people as they ran away. There were 500 pieces in the village everywhere \u2026 we wanted to remove them. Some were inside the house in the courtyard and kitchen \u2026 [the de-mining organisation] kept on promising they would come but they never came. They told us they were busy in other areas. By February, we were forced to clean them ourselves because of the children. At the time I went into the house and put ten [submunitions] on a tray and carried them out of the house. The bombs started hitting against each other and one went off. I dropped the tray and the rest went off.\u201d", "Hindi Ibrahim sustained shrapnel injuries to his abdomen, arm and hip.

While the full extent of cluster munition contamination is not yet known, in the first three weeks of their work YEMAC says its teams working in Sa\u2019da and Hajjah cleared at least 418 cluster bomb submunitions, 810 fuses, 51 mortars and more than 70 missiles. Tragically, the centre had to abruptly halt its operations on 26 April after three of its staff - Mohammed Ahmed Ali Al Sharafi, Mustafa Abdullah Saleh Al Harazi and Hussein Abdo Mohssien Al Salami - were killed in a cluster munition accident in Dugheij village in Hayran, Hajjah governorate.", "International assistance is urgently needed to de-mine contaminated areas and countries with influence should urge the Saudi Arabia-led coalition forces to stop using cluster bomb munitions, which are internationally banned and inherently indiscriminate.", "Amnesty International\u2019s Senior Crisis Advisor Lama Fakih said:", "\u201cEven after hostilities have died down, the lives and livelihoods of civilians, including young children, continue to be on the line in Yemen as they return to de facto minefields.

A US Department of Defense contract worth $641 million for the manufacture of 1,300 CBU-105 sensor-fused weapons for Saudi Arabia was agreed in 2013. The BLU-108, manufactured by Textron Defense Systems, is an air-delivered container, containing four further smart \u201cSkeet\u201d submunitions. The BLU-108 is released from its dispenser and a parachute deploys to slow its descent. It then fires the four rapidly-rotating Skeets, which use multi-mode optical sensors to identify a suitable target. On detonation, an explosively-formed penetrator breaks through armour producing incendiary effects, as well as a fragmentation ring to damage human targets. The presence of BLU-108 submunitions in Yemen which have failed to detonate or self-destruct contradict claims by the US Security Defense Cooperation Agency that these munitions do not result in more than 1% unexploded ordnance \u201cacross the range of intended operational environments.\u201d The US Government prohibits the sale or transfer of cluster munitions with greater than a 1% fail rate, a \u201cstandard\u201d which it appears to be failing to meet.", "Saudi Arabia and partners have legal responsibility to avoid indiscriminate weapon usage", "The USA and Brazil have so far both failed to join the Convention on Cluster Munitions, and likewise Yemen, Saudi Arabia and other coalition members are also outside the convention. However, under customary international humanitarian law, coalition members must avoid using inherently indiscriminate weapons, which invariably pose a threat to civilians, and they have a responsibility to facilitate clearance of areas contaminated with unexploded ordnance.", "Amnesty is calling on members of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition to immediately provide the UN with detailed data on its cluster munition attacks in Yemen - including maps, exact dates of strikes, specific types and quantities of weapons used - in order to facilitate clearance and risk-education activities, and to reduce the potential for further civilian casualties. Meanwhile, countries in a position to do so should provide all possible technical, financial, material and other assistance to facilitate the marking and clearance, removal or destruction of cluster submunitions, duds and other explosive remnants of war. They should also provide victim assistance, including for the medical and psychological care and rehabilitation of victims and their families, as well as education over the risk of encountering unexploded ordnance. Yemeni diplomats indicated on 19 May at a UN conference that Yemen is strongly considering acceding to the cluster munitions convention given the degree to which the country has been affected by the weapon.", "For years, Amnesty and others have been calling on all countries to immediately halt the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions and to join the Convention on Cluster Munitions. The convention prohibits the production, use, sale and transfer of cluster munitions, and Amnesty is insisting that the UK - as a significant past manufacturer and supplier of the weapons - has a strong moral obligation to assist with the clearance of areas currently affected by them, not least those that may have been struck by UK-made cluster munitions. Since February Amnesty has also urged all countries to ensure that no party to the conflict in Yemen is supplied - either directly or indirectly - with weapons, munitions, military equipment or technology that could be used in the conflict until they end serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and support independent, impartial investigations into allegations of violations by all parties.", "Cluster munition types Amnesty has documented in Yemen armed conflict", "US CBU-58 A/B bomb dispensing US BLU-63 submunitions - air-launched, USA origin, stockpiled by Saudi Arabia, Morocco", "CBU-87 bomb dispensing US BLU-97 submunitions - air-launched, USA origin, stockpiled by Saudi Arabia, UAE", "CBU-105 sensor-fused bomb with BLU-108/B canisters and unexploded \u201cSkeet\u201d submunitions - air-launched, USA origin, stockpiled by Saudi Arabia, UAE", "BL-755 cluster bomb with 147 high-explosive dual-purpose bomblets - air-launched, UK origin, stockpiled by Saudi Arabia, UAE", "ASTROS II rocket motor which can be fitted with up to 65 submunitions - ground-launched, Brazil origin, stockpiled by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain", "M42/M46 or M77 \u201cDual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition\u201d - ground-launched, USA origin, stockpiled by UAE, Bahrain, Egypt", "https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/saudi-arabia-led-coalition-has-used-uk-manufactured-cluster-bombs-yemen-new-evidence and in short by Reuters http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-britain-arms-idUSKCN0YE26W and by The Independent: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/british-made-cluster-bomb-found-in-yemeni-village-targeted-by-saudi-led-coalition-a7042626.html and by RT: https://www.rt.com/uk/344056-cluster-bombs-yemen-saudi/", "Comment: Nobody should be astonished about that.", "23.5.2016 \u2013 Oxfam (* A K P)", "Reaction: Reports of UK-manufactured cluster bombs used in Yemen", "In response to Amnesty International's report of UK manufactured cluster bombs being used in Yemen, Mark Goldring, Chief Executive of Oxfam GB, said:", "\"This underlines a simple truth - Britain's arms sales and technical military support are fuelling a brutal war in Yemen.  \"The war has left more than 80 percent of the population in urgent need of aid, and kills or injures six children a day.  \"If Britain wants to be a moral force in the world it should immediately halt all support for this war and put pressure on all involved to stop the reckless disregard of civilians' safety.\"", "http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/05/reaction-report-of-uk-manufactured-cluster-bombs-used-in-yemen#Qu3o0gyYUrpig3LR.01", "And read the standard British government's reaction here:", "23.5.2016 \u2013 The Independent (** A K P)", "British-made cluster bomb found in Yemeni village targeted by Saudi-led coalition", "A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: \u201cThe UK is not a member of the Saudi-led Coalition.

The use of cluster bombs is banned under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, to which the UK is a State Party. The organization interviewed 30 people, including survivors of cluster bomb submunitions and other unexploded ordnance (UXO) as well as their families, eyewitnesses, demining experts, activists and first responders. It documented 10 new cases in which 16 civilians were injured or killed by cluster munitions between July 2015 and April 2016. This includes nine children, two of whom were killed. These casualties took place days, weeks, and sometimes months after the bombs were dropped by coalition forces in Yemen.  With a lull in fighting along the Yemeni-Saudi border since a local ceasefire was agreed in March 2016, civilians began returning home and felt safer moving around the governorates of Hajjah and Sa\u2019da. But demining officials, local residents and first responders told Amnesty International they continued to see civilians injured by explosions, with a rise in casualties from unexploded ordnance particularly in areas along the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border including in Midi, Haradh, Hayran, Bakil al-Mir, and Mustabah in Hajjah governorate and al-Safra, Razih, Shada and Baqim in Sa\u2019da governorate. Many civilians, including children, are now exposed to potentially deadly submunitions and other explosive remnants of war without any knowledge of their presence or the risk they pose. Meanwhile, recent flood waters have moved the submunitions and other unexploded ordnance into areas where civilians do not expect them to be. Up to this point, the Saudi Arabia-led coalition has not formally confirmed its use of cluster munitions. However, in an interview with CNN on 11 January 2016, the spokesperson of the coalition\u2019s military forces, General Ahmed al-Asiri, categorically denied that the coalition had used cluster munitions in attacks anywhere in Yemen other than in one instance, describing the use of air-dropped CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed Weapons on a military target in Hajjah in April 2015.", "Civilians describe dire need of assistance to clear contaminated areas", "Recognizing the serious risk unexploded ordnance presents to the civilian population, Yemen\u2019s sole demining agency, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (YEMAC), began clearing and detonating the weapons in Sa\u2019da and Hajjah in early April 2016, despite being ill-equipped and trained.

The Director of YEMAC, Ahmed Yahya Alawi, told Amnesty International that the centre\u2019s clearance work was suspended pending an investigation into the men\u2019s deaths, but that he believed the deaths were caused by one of the men\u2019s failure to take adequate precautions in moving the submunitions and his proximity to his colleagues when doing so.

Amnesty International interviewed a 13-year-old boy who was injured in the late afternoon on a day in January 2016 after apparently picking up a submunition near a spring that locals rely on for water in Noug\u2019a, a small village surrounded by agricultural land in al-Safra, Sa\u2019da governorate, approximately 20-25 kilometres from the border with Saudi Arabia. According to locals interviewed by Amnesty International, the area is separated from the frontlines by a few kilometres and during the heavy fighting, they hear the sound of incoming and outgoing ground-launched attacks.  The victim said the bomblets were green and shaped like \u201ca small ball that you play with.\u201d This description is consistent with the US-made BLU-63 cluster bomb submunitions.", "\u201cI saw the bomb [submunition] close to where we were filling water and as I was walking along I saw it [on the ground].

AQAP claims to have dispersed its forces without suffering much damage, and many indications exist that intact AQAP cadres escaped from Aden and Mukalla to rally in nearby rural redoubts.

Other goat herders told Amnesty that the prevalence of bomblets in grazing areas has forced them to keep their goats locked up and feed them straw, which is costly and unsustainable. In most cases, farmers and herders told Amnesty they had no choice but to work in areas affected hit by cluster bombs despite the risks.", "Amnesty also interviewed a 13-year-old boy who was injured in January after apparently picking up a bomblet near a spring that locals rely on for water in a small village surrounded by agricultural land in al-Safra, Sa\u2019da governorate, some 15 miles from the Saudi Arabia border.

There were also Apaches [helicopters] that shot at people as they ran away. There were 500 pieces in the village everywhere \u2026 we wanted to remove them. Some were inside the house in the courtyard and kitchen \u2026 [the de-mining organisation] kept on promising they would come but they never came. They told us they were busy in other areas. By February, we were forced to clean them ourselves because of the children. At the time I went into the house and put ten [submunitions] on a tray and carried them out of the house.

A US Department of Defense contract worth $641 million for the manufacture of 1,300 CBU-105 sensor-fused weapons for Saudi Arabia was agreed in 2013. The BLU-108, manufactured by Textron Defense Systems, is an air-delivered container, containing four further smart \u201cSkeet\u201d submunitions. The BLU-108 is released from its dispenser and a parachute deploys to slow its descent. It then fires the four rapidly-rotating Skeets, which use multi-mode optical sensors to identify a suitable target. On detonation, an explosively-formed penetrator breaks through armour producing incendiary effects, as well as a fragmentation ring to damage human targets. The presence of BLU-108 submunitions in Yemen which have failed to detonate or self-destruct contradict claims by the US Security Defense Cooperation Agency that these munitions do not result in more than 1% unexploded ordnance \u201cacross the range of intended operational environments.\u201d The US Government prohibits the sale or transfer of cluster munitions with greater than a 1% fail rate, a \u201cstandard\u201d which it appears to be failing to meet.", "Saudi Arabia and partners have legal responsibility to avoid indiscriminate weapon usage", "The USA and Brazil have so far both failed to join the Convention on Cluster Munitions, and likewise Yemen, Saudi Arabia and other coalition members are also outside the convention. However, under customary international humanitarian law, coalition members must avoid using inherently indiscriminate weapons, which invariably pose a threat to civilians, and they have a responsibility to facilitate clearance of areas contaminated with unexploded ordnance.", "Amnesty is calling on members of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition to immediately provide the UN with detailed data on its cluster munition attacks in Yemen - including maps, exact dates of strikes, specific types and quantities of weapons used - in order to facilitate clearance and risk-education activities, and to reduce the potential for further civilian casualties. Meanwhile, countries in a position to do so should provide all possible technical, financial, material and other assistance to facilitate the marking and clearance, removal or destruction of cluster submunitions, duds and other explosive remnants of war. They should also provide victim assistance, including for the medical and psychological care and rehabilitation of victims and their families, as well as education over the risk of encountering unexploded ordnance. Yemeni diplomats indicated on 19 May at a UN conference that Yemen is strongly considering acceding to the cluster munitions convention given the degree to which the country has been affected by the weapon.", "For years, Amnesty and others have been calling on all countries to immediately halt the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions and to join the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

The use of cluster bombs is banned under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, to which the UK is a State Party. The organization interviewed 30 people, including survivors of cluster bomb submunitions and other unexploded ordnance (UXO) as well as their families, eyewitnesses, demining experts, activists and first responders. It documented 10 new cases in which 16 civilians were injured or killed by cluster munitions between July 2015 and April 2016. This includes nine children, two of whom were killed. These casualties took place days, weeks, and sometimes months after the bombs were dropped by coalition forces in Yemen.  With a lull in fighting along the Yemeni-Saudi border since a local ceasefire was agreed in March 2016, civilians began returning home and felt safer moving around the governorates of Hajjah and Sa\u2019da. But demining officials, local residents and first responders told Amnesty International they continued to see civilians injured by explosions, with a rise in casualties from unexploded ordnance particularly in areas along the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border including in Midi, Haradh, Hayran, Bakil al-Mir, and Mustabah in Hajjah governorate and al-Safra, Razih, Shada and Baqim in Sa\u2019da governorate. Many civilians, including children, are now exposed to potentially deadly submunitions and other explosive remnants of war without any knowledge of their presence or the risk they pose. Meanwhile, recent flood waters have moved the submunitions and other unexploded ordnance into areas where civilians do not expect them to be. Up to this point, the Saudi Arabia-led coalition has not formally confirmed its use of cluster munitions. However, in an interview with CNN on 11 January 2016, the spokesperson of the coalition\u2019s military forces, General Ahmed al-Asiri, categorically denied that the coalition had used cluster munitions in attacks anywhere in Yemen other than in one instance, describing the use of air-dropped CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed Weapons on a military target in Hajjah in April 2015.", "Civilians describe dire need of assistance to clear contaminated areas", "Recognizing the serious risk unexploded ordnance presents to the civilian population, Yemen\u2019s sole demining agency, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (YEMAC), began clearing and detonating the weapons in Sa\u2019da and Hajjah in early April 2016, despite being ill-equipped and trained.

The Director of YEMAC, Ahmed Yahya Alawi, told Amnesty International that the centre\u2019s clearance work was suspended pending an investigation into the men\u2019s deaths, but that he believed the deaths were caused by one of the men\u2019s failure to take adequate precautions in moving the submunitions and his proximity to his colleagues when doing so. He blamed the men\u2019s inadequate training and lamented the ineffectiveness and age of their equipment. \u201c[Different] types of cluster munitions have been used [by the coalition] but we have only worked with four of the types before.

In particular, the United Arab Emirates took responsibility for disrupting AQAP\u2019s unsettling growth in Aden\u2019s neighborhoods, ports, and universities, in effect vouchsafing the seat of Hadi\u2019s government.

In addition to helicopters and turboprop surveillance aircraft, the coalition executes numerous daily sorties using fixed-wing forward air controllers using advanced optical pods and ground-search radar, and it also deploys a number of types of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of operating 200 to 250 kilometers from their ground control stations.

AQAP claims to have dispersed its forces without suffering much damage, and many indications exist that intact AQAP cadres escaped from Aden and Mukalla to rally in nearby rural redoubts.
