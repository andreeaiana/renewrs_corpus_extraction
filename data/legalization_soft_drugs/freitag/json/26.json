In the report, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights provides an overview of the extent and quality of the cooperation between the national commission of inquiry and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

The perpetuation of the conflict and its consequences on the population in Yemen are devastating. Almost 3,600 civilians have been killed and more than 6,000 injured. The humanitarian crisis has deepened, with at least 7.6 million people, including 3 million women and children, currently suffering from malnutrition according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. At least 2.8 million people, more than 400,000 families, have been forced to flee their homes in search of safety as their homes and livelihoods were being destroyed.", "68. The conflict has given rise to a growing number of allegations of violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law. The degeneration of the overall security situation has created security vacuums that are increasingly being exploited by armed groups, including groups pledging allegiance to Al-Qaida and ISIL. There has also been a disturbing increase in the divisive rhetoric of certain political and religious leaders, which risks aggravating sectarian, regional divisions within Yemen and undermining the social fabric of Yemeni society.", "69. The prolonged duration of the conflict has strongly heightened the disastrous risk of a systemic collapse of Yemen. The resilience of the Yemeni people has been stretched beyond human limits. The international community, in its full range of political, legal and civil forces, has a legal and moral duty to take urgent steps to alleviate the appalling levels of human despair, protect the people in Yemen, allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need, promote measures to find a durable political solution, and ensure accountability for violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law.", "70.

For one thing, the U.S. is now badly compromised as a mediator in any diplomatic process because of the extensive and continuing support that the U.S. provides to the coalition. The U.S. is and is perceived to be on one side of the war, and so any arrangement that our government favors is bound to be viewed with suspicion by the Houthis and Saleh as well as millions of Yemenis. It isn\u2019t possible for the U.S. to be a credible broker between the warring parties when Washington has thrown its weight firmly behind the Saudis and their allies. Thatincludes the backing the U.S. has given the Saudis at the U.N. when they have stymied all efforts to have an independent investigation of war crimes by all parties to the conflict. Kerry is personally a terrible messenger because of his repeated public statements in support of the coalition. He was also reportedly the strongest advocate inside the administration for backing the Saudi-led war.", "Given all this, whatever plan the U.S. devises along with Britain, the Saudis, and the UAE won\u2019t be acceptable to Yemenis that have been living with the dire consequences of the Saudi-led, U.S.-backed intervention.", "If the U.S. and Britain were willing to pressure the coalition to halt or at least scale back their campaign, that might create an opening for a political compromise, but the administration has shown no desire to do this.

The US and UK might take a stand and reclaim some of the moral authority and independence they have lost through unconditional support for the Saudi-led aerial campaign. The alternative is more bloodshed -- and further loss of faith in the commitment of two founder members of the UN Security Council to International Humanitarian Law.", "For all that they would have us believe otherwise UK and US are not mere bystanders in this. Both countries have sold Saudi Arabia billions of dollars of weapons for use in Yemen since the war began.

With this in mind the Saudis, Yemenis opposed to the coup, and indeed Western officials, find it difficult to understand why so much attention is being paid to the Saudis' worst excesses. They aren't the bad guys, the argument goes.

Even if we stretch ourselves to limits and say that Saudi Arabia is fighting these \"terror groups\", the war in Yemen is certainly not about fighting \"terrorism.\" This is a war against the Houthis of Yemen who had been side-lined and excluded from the structures of economic and political power for decades and who have been now forced into raising an armed resistance against the atrocities they had been subjected to. The House of Saud is far from fighting A-Qaeda or any other real \"terror group\", it is fighting the people of Yemen and has killed thousands of civilians.  The Saudis are at war with the so-called Houthis. They're not going after Al-Qaeda despite the fact that the group Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP, was, for a long time considered the most dangerous and most likely to launch an international attack.  There is, therefore, a glaring double game the U.S. is playing in Yemen. Not only does it not have actually \"pulled out\" of Yemen, but also has not put any pressure on Saudi Arabia to either fight real terror groups or stop bombing innocent civilians. The news of \"pull out\" of U.S. personnel from Yemen, therefore, carries little to no significance in that it does not, in any way, signify a change in the U.S.' strategic orientation vis-\u00e0-vis Saudi Arabia.

The perpetuation of the conflict and its consequences on the population in Yemen are devastating. Almost 3,600 civilians have been killed and more than 6,000 injured. The humanitarian crisis has deepened, with at least 7.6 million people, including 3 million women and children, currently suffering from malnutrition according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. At least 2.8 million people, more than 400,000 families, have been forced to flee their homes in search of safety as their homes and livelihoods were being destroyed.", "68. The conflict has given rise to a growing number of allegations of violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law. The degeneration of the overall security situation has created security vacuums that are increasingly being exploited by armed groups, including groups pledging allegiance to Al-Qaida and ISIL. There has also been a disturbing increase in the divisive rhetoric of certain political and religious leaders, which risks aggravating sectarian, regional divisions within Yemen and undermining the social fabric of Yemeni society.", "69. The prolonged duration of the conflict has strongly heightened the disastrous risk of a systemic collapse of Yemen. The resilience of the Yemeni people has been stretched beyond human limits. The international community, in its full range of political, legal and civil forces, has a legal and moral duty to take urgent steps to alleviate the appalling levels of human despair, protect the people in Yemen, allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need, promote measures to find a durable political solution, and ensure accountability for violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law.", "70.

Even if we stretch ourselves to limits and say that Saudi Arabia is fighting these \"terror groups\", the war in Yemen is certainly not about fighting \"terrorism.\" This is a war against the Houthis of Yemen who had been side-lined and excluded from the structures of economic and political power for decades and who have been now forced into raising an armed resistance against the atrocities they had been subjected to. The House of Saud is far from fighting A-Qaeda or any other real \"terror group\", it is fighting the people of Yemen and has killed thousands of civilians.  The Saudis are at war with the so-called Houthis. They're not going after Al-Qaeda despite the fact that the group Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP, was, for a long time considered the most dangerous and most likely to launch an international attack.  There is, therefore, a glaring double game the U.S. is playing in Yemen. Not only does it not have actually \"pulled out\" of Yemen, but also has not put any pressure on Saudi Arabia to either fight real terror groups or stop bombing innocent civilians.

through my eyes, for you", "Our friend Ahmed Nusfaleal travelled more than 10 hours to reach Sanaa.One hundred and fifty km, in times of war and road blocks, check-points and madness of these days, meant a detour of additional, tiring hours. With no certainty to reach, safely, the Capital. Literally, a trip into the unknown.", "Still, when Ahmed reached Sanaa, he took these pictures to share with the world.", "He invites everyone to see Sanaa through his eyes: the people, the Old City, the markets, the sellers, the smiles. The herbs, the flowers, goat milk, As-Saylah (the wadi which \u2013 in monsoon season becomes a river), the centuries old architecture, people getting ready to celebrate weddings and that strong, unbeatable will to accept anything which happens and might come with dignity and strength (photos)", "https://thetalkingofthesoul.wordpress.com/2016/08/25/ahmed-nusfaleal-sanaa-through-my-eyes-for-you/", "16.8.2016 \u2013 TED X (**)", "Fossil Hunting in the Yemen: Archaeologists Without Borders", "In this hilarious and thought-provoking talk, National Geographic Explorer and stand\u00adup comic Ella Al-Shamahi explains why a huge part of the planet's potential contribution to science is being overlooked.

National Geographic Explorer and stand\u00adup comic Ella Al-Shamahi is a hilarious paleoanthropologist who specializes in Neanderthals. Much of her work involves fossil hunting in caves in dangerous locations such as Yemen.
