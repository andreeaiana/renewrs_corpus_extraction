Amnesty International has documented the experience of displaced civilians in Yemen and how persons with disabilities have been disproportionately impacted. In the report, Excluded: Living with disabilities in Yemen\u2019s armed conflict, the organization examined the situation of 31 persons with disabilities who had been displaced to the southern governorates of Aden, Lahj and Abyan.", "There is currently no reliable data available on the number of persons with disabilities in Yemen or their needs. The lack of capacity to collect data, especially during conflict, and accompanying challenges are reflected in the discrepancy of the data that does exist. While the latest statistics from the Arab region placed the number of persons with disabilities at the relatively low figure of 6.8% in Yemen, calculations based on global estimates by the World Health Organization suggest that as many as 4.5 million Yemenis are persons with disabilities.3 In contrast to assessments for other countries in crisis in the region, the UN\u2019s humanitarian needs overview for Yemen does not include qualitative data on persons with disabilities, but merely refers to them as a vulnerable group particularly at risk.", "Amnesty International viewed the form used by humanitarian workers involved in protection monitoring to register displaced persons and identify their needs. Under a section on \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d, the form seeks to collect data on persons with disabilities and disaggregate it by gender, age (0-4, 5-11, 12-17, 18-24, 25-59, 60+), and two broad categories of disability (mental and physical)", "EXPERIENCES OF IDPS WITH DISABILITIES (INCLUDING INTERSECTIONAL ANALYSIS)", "Amnesty International found that displaced persons with disabilities in Yemen encountered compounded difficulties, starting with their displacement journey. In some cases, the situation of civilians with disabilities was worsened by the failure of the parties to the conflict to give effective advance warning of attacks likely to affect the civilian population.7 Even after reaching shelter, such as an IDP camp, and despite efforts by the humanitarian community to be more inclusive of the rights of displaced persons with disabilities, they have struggled to obtain equal access to facilities and aid.", "Almost all those whose cases were documented had to be dependent on their family members during the trip, the vast majority of them travelling without any assistive devices such as wheelchairs and crutches.", "Amnesty International observed the general absence of the participation of persons with disabilities in camp or community governance and decision making. In only one out of five IDP sites visited by the organization \u2013 a camp in Aden \u2013 was there a person with a disability who appeared to be a co-ordinator with the site\u2019s management. Conditions varied in the different sites Amnesty International researchers visited, however all sites fell below providing an adequate standard of living for anyone, with particular challenges and significant access issues for persons with disabilities.", "Persons with disabilities who did have mattresses in their shelters had rather thin ones that looked neither durable, nor comfortable, let alone helpful in relieving bedsores for those with limited mobility. Overall, there was a noted shortage of assistive devices such as tricycles, wheelchairs, canes, crutches, and the government\u2019s existing distribution system was largely centralized, putting the onus on persons with disabilities to seek out devices and collect them. The majority of those who did have wheelchairs said the devices were handed out by wealthy individuals, not as part of an organized process, and without any accompanying guidance on usage for the recipients or their family members as per recommended global standards.8 Interviewees said the wheelchairs they had were not suitable for the rugged terrain in the camps, were generally of low quality and did not facilitate their autonomy and independence", "Many spoke of the inaccessibility of latrines and washing facilities. In all the sites visited by Amnesty International, there were no dedicated latrines for persons with disabilities or private facilities for those who cannot move around, and researchers observed the absence of handles, ropes or chairs that would enable persons with disabilities to use latrines", "In practically all the cases documented, persons with disabilities had to rely on their relatives to help them go to the latrines in the camps. The vast majority said they washed inside their tents, the conditions of housing and sanitation facilities having a clear impact on their ability to practise self-care and undermining their autonomy, privacy and inherent dignity.", "The majority of those whose cases were documented depended on their family members to collect aid \u2013 be it rations or cash-based assistance \u2013 on their behalf. Whether handed out off site or in distribution points in camps, the model is based on individuals having to go to these collection points, which poses a problem for people with limited or no mobility. Families said they had to incur additional transport costs to collect aid from off-site locations.", "https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde31/1822/2020/en/", "and full report. https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/MDE3118222020ENGLISH.pdf", "(** B P)", "Analysis: Tribal sheikhs and the war in Yemen", "Understanding how Yemeni tribes function and the role of tribal leaders is crucial to design effective programs to engage them", "There is a growing interest among donors and western diplomats to explore the role tribal leaders can play to end the war in Yemen. This is a major shift in attitude as, until very recently, there was so much resistance among donors to do any work with Yemeni tribes out of fear it would undermine the \"state.\"", "The role of tribal leaders is largely misunderstood among western observers and urban Yemenis alike. Their influence and power are often both oversimplified and exaggerated with assumptions that tribal leaders have absolute control and unchecked authority over their tribes. They are mistakenly described as \u201crulers,\u201d almost small dictators, who possess absolute power, over isolated territories. Tribesmen are often portrayed as mercenaries who follow their tribal leaders\u2019 orders.[1]", "In reality, tribes are egalitarian, not hierarchical, social institutions and as such do not have a command-and-control structure as often assumed. The authority of tribal leaders largely depends on their ability to provide for their tribes. They can influence and persuade but not force their tribesmen to take a certain course. Men from tribes involved in fighting in frontline have chosen to side with Houthis or the government, many times against the will of their tribal leaders.[2]", "Understanding how Yemeni tribes function and the role of tribal leaders is crucial to design effective programs to engage them. Overestimating the role of tribal leaders risks coming up with flawed interventions that might do more harm than good. Tribal leaders have much to offer but there are nevertheless major limitations to what they can do. This piece will look into the role of tribal leaders in areas where there is active fighting.", "The war's impact on tribal leaders", "Across Yemen, tribal leaders\u2019 influence was greatly undermined by the loss of allowances and financial assistance they used to receive form the government in Sana\u2019a and from the Saudis in 2014.[3] Some tribal leaders on both sides have embedded themselves into current patronage networks and have been enriched as a result. However, the majority remained sidelined and are struggling to deal with an increasingly challenging and complex situation that threatens them and their communities.", "Five years of war in Yemen has had a heavy impact on tribal leaders. Most fighters on the frontlines on both sides come from tribes and many of them were recruited directly or indirectly by tribal leaders. Tens of thousands of these men have been killed fighting in a seemingly endless war. Tribal leaders are responsible in front of their tribes for the fate of the fighters they recruited. There is also an expectation among tribes that tribal leaders will take care of the families of the dead and arrange medical care for the injured. As a result, there is a strong desire among tribal leaders to end the war. \u201cThe tribes have grown tired of fighting. We are bored of this war game that doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere. Tribes on both sides want an end to this and to stop the bleeding of their men,\u201d a tribal leader from Marib said", "Negative consequences of the war on tribal leaders are more prominent in Houthi-controlled areas where the rebel group has systematically worked to dismantle the tribal structure and subjugate the tribes. Houthis seek to weaken the tribes because they are aware that strong tribes can be a threat to their reign in the future.", "Recruitment of Fighters", "Tribal leaders play a key role in mobilizing fighters but the motives and circumstances differ.", "Tribal leaders\u2019 role in de-escalation", "De-escalation is embedded in tribal culture.Tribal leaders on both sides strive to maintain friendship and respect to each other despite political differences. That spirit of tolerance is rooted in tribal culture. On frontlines, tribal leaders sometimes successfully negotiate short ceasefires and safe exit for civilians.[17] They have successfully brokered deals that led to the exchange of thousands of prisoners between the Houthis and the government and between the Houthis and local tribes.[18]", "Tribal leaders have also prevented backlash after liberating certain areas from the Houthis. For example, When government forces retook the cities of Hareeb in Marib and Bayhan in Shabwa, the commander of the government force who is also a tribal leader, Mufarreh Behebeh, negotiated amnesty for tribal leaders and tribesmen who aided the Houthis in exchange for a commitment from them to not pick up arms against the government in the future.", "In Al-Baydha, Marib, Shabwa, and Al-Jawf, tribal leaders have put their tribal conflicts on hold so that they are not exacerbated by the war and to have a unified front against the Houthis. In some cases, this spirit of unity has created an opportunity to resolve long standing tribal feuds.", "Limitations and Risks of Engagement", "Despite what they offer, tribal leaders\u2019 ability to mitigate the war is limited when it comes to negotiating national-level conflicts or conflicts of a political nature in general. Tribal leaders try to avoid being entangled in power struggle among the political elite out of fear it would drag their tribes into violence and threaten the fragile stability the tribes are already struggling to maintain.[23]", "The strength of tribal mediation lies in the fact that they are apolitical by nature. Tribal leaders are effective in mediating agreements that lead to prisoner swaps, facilitation of humanitarian assistance, and protection of civilians. They can have valuable contributions to de-escalation and to monitoring ceasefires at the local level. Their incentive is to protect their communities from violence. Because it is largely based on forgiveness, accommodation, compromise, and a win-win approach, tribal mediation can also be effective in post war reconciliation.", "As the issue of engaging tribes is being discussed, it is important to realize that neither the tribal leaders nor the tribes offer a magic bullet. De-escalation remains entirely dependent on the political will of conflict parties and their regional backers to genuinely end the conflict. Tribal leaders don\u2019t have the leverage or power to influence that in a decisive way \u2013 by Nadwa Dawsari", "https://al-masdaronline.net/national/345", "My comment: Quite interesting, by an author well-known for this subject, but her anti-Houthis bias must be kept in mind.", "(** B H)", "Heuschreckenplage am Horn von Afrika \u2013 M\u00f6glicher Vorl\u00e4ufer einer epischen Hungersnot", "Im Schatten des Corona-Virus entwickelt sich, gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils an der Wahrnehmung der \u00d6ffentlichkeit vorbei, eine weitere Krise epidemischen Ausma\u00dfes.

In only one out of five IDP sites visited by the organization \u2013 a camp in Aden \u2013 was there a person with a disability who appeared to be a co-ordinator with the site\u2019s management. Conditions varied in the different sites Amnesty International researchers visited, however all sites fell below providing an adequate standard of living for anyone, with particular challenges and significant access issues for persons with disabilities.", "Persons with disabilities who did have mattresses in their shelters had rather thin ones that looked neither durable, nor comfortable, let alone helpful in relieving bedsores for those with limited mobility. Overall, there was a noted shortage of assistive devices such as tricycles, wheelchairs, canes, crutches, and the government\u2019s existing distribution system was largely centralized, putting the onus on persons with disabilities to seek out devices and collect them. The majority of those who did have wheelchairs said the devices were handed out by wealthy individuals, not as part of an organized process, and without any accompanying guidance on usage for the recipients or their family members as per recommended global standards.8 Interviewees said the wheelchairs they had were not suitable for the rugged terrain in the camps, were generally of low quality and did not facilitate their autonomy and independence", "Many spoke of the inaccessibility of latrines and washing facilities. In all the sites visited by Amnesty International, there were no dedicated latrines for persons with disabilities or private facilities for those who cannot move around, and researchers observed the absence of handles, ropes or chairs that would enable persons with disabilities to use latrines", "In practically all the cases documented, persons with disabilities had to rely on their relatives to help them go to the latrines in the camps. The vast majority said they washed inside their tents, the conditions of housing and sanitation facilities having a clear impact on their ability to practise self-care and undermining their autonomy, privacy and inherent dignity.", "The majority of those whose cases were documented depended on their family members to collect aid \u2013 be it rations or cash-based assistance \u2013 on their behalf. Whether handed out off site or in distribution points in camps, the model is based on individuals having to go to these collection points, which poses a problem for people with limited or no mobility.

This is a major shift in attitude as, until very recently, there was so much resistance among donors to do any work with Yemeni tribes out of fear it would undermine the \"state.\"", "The role of tribal leaders is largely misunderstood among western observers and urban Yemenis alike. Their influence and power are often both oversimplified and exaggerated with assumptions that tribal leaders have absolute control and unchecked authority over their tribes. They are mistakenly described as \u201crulers,\u201d almost small dictators, who possess absolute power, over isolated territories. Tribesmen are often portrayed as mercenaries who follow their tribal leaders\u2019 orders.[1]", "In reality, tribes are egalitarian, not hierarchical, social institutions and as such do not have a command-and-control structure as often assumed. The authority of tribal leaders largely depends on their ability to provide for their tribes. They can influence and persuade but not force their tribesmen to take a certain course. Men from tribes involved in fighting in frontline have chosen to side with Houthis or the government, many times against the will of their tribal leaders.[2]", "Understanding how Yemeni tribes function and the role of tribal leaders is crucial to design effective programs to engage them. Overestimating the role of tribal leaders risks coming up with flawed interventions that might do more harm than good. Tribal leaders have much to offer but there are nevertheless major limitations to what they can do. This piece will look into the role of tribal leaders in areas where there is active fighting.", "The war's impact on tribal leaders", "Across Yemen, tribal leaders\u2019 influence was greatly undermined by the loss of allowances and financial assistance they used to receive form the government in Sana\u2019a and from the Saudis in 2014.[3] Some tribal leaders on both sides have embedded themselves into current patronage networks and have been enriched as a result. However, the majority remained sidelined and are struggling to deal with an increasingly challenging and complex situation that threatens them and their communities.", "Five years of war in Yemen has had a heavy impact on tribal leaders. Most fighters on the frontlines on both sides come from tribes and many of them were recruited directly or indirectly by tribal leaders. Tens of thousands of these men have been killed fighting in a seemingly endless war. Tribal leaders are responsible in front of their tribes for the fate of the fighters they recruited. There is also an expectation among tribes that tribal leaders will take care of the families of the dead and arrange medical care for the injured. As a result, there is a strong desire among tribal leaders to end the war. \u201cThe tribes have grown tired of fighting. We are bored of this war game that doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere. Tribes on both sides want an end to this and to stop the bleeding of their men,\u201d a tribal leader from Marib said", "Negative consequences of the war on tribal leaders are more prominent in Houthi-controlled areas where the rebel group has systematically worked to dismantle the tribal structure and subjugate the tribes. Houthis seek to weaken the tribes because they are aware that strong tribes can be a threat to their reign in the future.", "Recruitment of Fighters", "Tribal leaders play a key role in mobilizing fighters but the motives and circumstances differ.", "Tribal leaders\u2019 role in de-escalation", "De-escalation is embedded in tribal culture.Tribal leaders on both sides strive to maintain friendship and respect to each other despite political differences. That spirit of tolerance is rooted in tribal culture. On frontlines, tribal leaders sometimes successfully negotiate short ceasefires and safe exit for civilians.[17] They have successfully brokered deals that led to the exchange of thousands of prisoners between the Houthis and the government and between the Houthis and local tribes.[18]", "Tribal leaders have also prevented backlash after liberating certain areas from the Houthis. For example, When government forces retook the cities of Hareeb in Marib and Bayhan in Shabwa, the commander of the government force who is also a tribal leader, Mufarreh Behebeh, negotiated amnesty for tribal leaders and tribesmen who aided the Houthis in exchange for a commitment from them to not pick up arms against the government in the future.", "In Al-Baydha, Marib, Shabwa, and Al-Jawf, tribal leaders have put their tribal conflicts on hold so that they are not exacerbated by the war and to have a unified front against the Houthis. In some cases, this spirit of unity has created an opportunity to resolve long standing tribal feuds.", "Limitations and Risks of Engagement", "Despite what they offer, tribal leaders\u2019 ability to mitigate the war is limited when it comes to negotiating national-level conflicts or conflicts of a political nature in general. Tribal leaders try to avoid being entangled in power struggle among the political elite out of fear it would drag their tribes into violence and threaten the fragile stability the tribes are already struggling to maintain.[23]", "The strength of tribal mediation lies in the fact that they are apolitical by nature. Tribal leaders are effective in mediating agreements that lead to prisoner swaps, facilitation of humanitarian assistance, and protection of civilians. They can have valuable contributions to de-escalation and to monitoring ceasefires at the local level. Their incentive is to protect their communities from violence. Because it is largely based on forgiveness, accommodation, compromise, and a win-win approach, tribal mediation can also be effective in post war reconciliation.", "As the issue of engaging tribes is being discussed, it is important to realize that neither the tribal leaders nor the tribes offer a magic bullet. De-escalation remains entirely dependent on the political will of conflict parties and their regional backers to genuinely end the conflict. Tribal leaders don\u2019t have the leverage or power to influence that in a decisive way \u2013 by Nadwa Dawsari", "https://al-masdaronline.net/national/345", "My comment: Quite interesting, by an author well-known for this subject, but her anti-Houthis bias must be kept in mind.", "(** B H)", "Heuschreckenplage am Horn von Afrika \u2013 M\u00f6glicher Vorl\u00e4ufer einer epischen Hungersnot", "Im Schatten des Corona-Virus entwickelt sich, gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils an der Wahrnehmung der \u00d6ffentlichkeit vorbei, eine weitere Krise epidemischen Ausma\u00dfes.
