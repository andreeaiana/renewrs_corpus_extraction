Airstrikes and shelling killed and wounded civilians, and hit schools, hospitals, healthcare facilities, and medical personnel. The armed group Ansar Allah (Houthis), UAE proxy forces, Yemeni government forces disappeared, tortured and arbitrarily detained scores. Saudi Arabia detained and abused Yemeni fishermen inside Saudi Arabia. The Houthi armed group laid anti-personnel mines. Both sides recruited children. US drone strikes killed and wounded civilians.

Blocking, obstructing and impeding humanitarian aid and critical life-saving goods has a particularly acute impact, given the millions of civilians already living under the threat of famine. Mwatana documented 74 cases of obstructing humanitarian access and aid\u2014with Ansar Allah (Houthis) responsible for the majority. Yemeni government and coalition forces also obstructed aid.", "People\u2019s ability to move freely inside and outside Yemen has decreased dramatically throughout the conflict.

The Saudi/UAE-led coalition still refuses to re-open Sanaa airport\u2014nearly three years after shuttering it.", "The failure to hold the Houthi armed group, the Saudi/UAE-led coalition and other armed actors accountable has meant that the same abuses Yemeni civilians suffered in the beginning of the conflict continue until this day. The Human Rights Council\u2019s creation of the Group of Eminent Experts in 2017 was an important step towards accountability, but the gravity of the human rights and humanitarian crises in Yemen requires more to be done, including the creation of a Commission of Inquiry.", "The Houthi armed group has laid antipersonnel and antivehicle landmines since the early days of the war. Mines have played a significant part in the battle for Yemen\u2019s western coast and have gravely impacted civilians across the country. In 2018 alone, Mwatana documented 52 landmines cases, killing at least 60 civilians, including 8 women and 26 children, and wounding at least 51 others, including 12 women and 21 children.", "Coalition airstrikes on civilians have not stopped. Mwatana documented about 150 coalition airstrikes in 11 governorates in 2018 that killed at least 375 civilians, including 165 children, and wounded 427 others, including 172 children. The attacks damaged private property and critical infrastructure, and struck residential neighborhoods, villages, roads, markets, commercial facilities, boats, and civilian vehicles.", "Both the Houthi armed group and forces loyal to the coalition and Yemeni government continued to launch indiscriminate ground attacks, and to recruit children. The Houthi armed group was responsible for the vast majority of the 1,117 child recruitment cases Mwatana documented in 2018, but Saudi/UAE-led coalition forces and forces loyal to President Hadi also used children. Coalition proxy forces have been implicated in a range of abuses\u2014from torture to sexual violence against kids. The US continued to carry out drone attacks in Yemen that killed and wounded civilians.", "Arbitrary detentions, disappearances and torture, in some cases, leading to death, continued across the country. People have been detained and tried in court for their religious beliefs, and others have been detained because of their media work. While the majority of victims of detention-related abuses were men, women have also been detained, mistreated, and sentenced to death following unfair trials. States should prioritize pressuring the warring parties to release the arbitrarily detained, to resolve disappearances and to improve detention conditions, Mwatana said.", "The space Yemenis had for expression, opposition, and voicing critical opinions before the conflict has been all but closed.

On the one hand, the Emirati move highlights serious problems in the continuing intervention there, pursued by the UAE and Saudi Arabia since March 2015. On the other hand, it points to differences in how the two countries perceive their four-year joint endeavor, one that they have considered pivotal in preventing a future Iranian sphere of influence in the Arabian Peninsula. These two considerations take on special significance today as the war appears stalemated and the Houthis seem to insist on bringing it to targets in Saudi Arabia itself, both military and civilian, and on occasion to the UAE.", "Considering the serious Houthi challenge on the border with Saudi Arabia, the UAE action cannot be a positive development for Saudi Arabia. In fact, Saudi officials are reported to have been disappointed and had \u201cintervened with the Emirati leaders to try to dissuade them from the drawdown.\u201d", "Additionally, withdrawing from Yemen\u2019s south exposes many of the militias the UAE nurtured and opens the possibility of competition and conflict among them. The Emirati intervention and conquest of Aden and other areas gave sustenance to the southern secessionists whose efforts had been stymied before. Today\u2019s Southern Transitional Council\u2014led by former Governor of Aden Aidarous al-Zubaidi, who was sacked by President Mansour Hadi in 2017\u2014has for all practical purposes taken over government functions in Aden and plans for self-determination. The UAE also supported militias like the Security Belt Forces and the Shabwani and Hadrami Elite Forces, all nominally part of the Yemeni Army, as well as the Salafi Amaliqa and Abu al-Abbas Brigades in addition to elements of the former People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY)", "The UAE\u2019s role in Yemen and its support for militias caused much consternation among the members of President Hadi\u2019s government who considered the UAE\u2019s actions an infringement on Yemeni sovereignty and a challenge to the president\u2019s legitimacy.", "This overall picture of UAE work in Yemen thus makes Abu Dhabi\u2019s decision to withdraw from Yemen an intriguing development. Important reasons must have necessitated it, given the significance of the Saudi-Emirati relationship and the level of investment the UAE has made in the war effort. These reasons include the following", "The Saudi Position", "One thing is sure after the UAE\u2019s decision: Saudi Arabia is in a bind. It cannot pursue an endless engagement in Yemen without reliable partners with military means like the UAE, and it cannot simply pack up and leave because that would amount to a strategic defeat that ensconces the Houthis in northern Yemen and in complete, unchallenged control. In essence, Saudi Arabia today may be rethinking the relationship that developed between its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the UAE\u2019s Mohammed bin Zayed as the influencer and supporter. Hard questions will emerge about this relationship, the value of the Saudi-Emirati alliance in Yemen, Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to cooperate with the UAE\u2019s friends in south Yemen, and several other issues on which the two countries have cooperated before.", "Be that as it may, the Saudi redeployment to areas vacated by the UAE in the southwest may arguably be a strategically necessary step pending other military or diplomatic developments.

In spite of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s close relationship with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, the U.S. Department of Defense recently pressured the UAE to allow an investigation into the abuse of detainees in Yemen. Backlash against the UAE\u2019s alleged arms shipments to al-Qaeda in Yemen and criticisms of the UAE\u2019s role in worsening Yemen\u2019s humanitarian crisis have also damaged the UAE\u2019s international reputation. As the UAE\u2019s geopolitical vision depends on blending hard and soft power, Abu Dhabi\u2019s withdrawal announcement was aimed, in part, at salvaging the UAE\u2019s tarnished reputation.", "As the Yemeni civil war drags on, UAE officials have also faced internal pressure to demonstrate that their involvement in Yemen is finite. Reservations about the sustainability of the UAE\u2019s military intervention first surfaced in official circles during the early stages of the conflict.", "Even though the UAE is downsizing its military presence, Abu Dhabi does not wish to surrender its influence in Yemen. To preserve its favorable strategic position, the UAE will selectively engage in counter-terrorism operations in Yemen, assist its proxies in their efforts to consolidate hegemony over southern Yemen, and expand its diplomatic involvement in Yemen. These actions will help ensure that UAE-Saudi Arabia relations are not severely damaged by Abu Dhabi\u2019s unilateral withdrawal and that the UAE will secure its interests in an eventual Yemeni peace settlement.", "In spite of the UAE\u2019s troop drawdown from Yemen, initial reports suggest that Abu Dhabi will maintain a military presence in its base on al-Mukalla, a former al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) stronghold that was overrun by the UAE in 2016.", "As Abu Dhabi\u2019s hegemony over Aden complements its rising military presence on the Red Sea and Horn of Africa, the UAE will ensure that its troop drawdown does not weaken its influence in southern Yemen. The Security Belt, a UAE-aligned south Yemeni paramilitary force, continues to maintain a formidable military presence throughout southern Yemen. The UAE has also reportedly directed the STC to establish a parallel army to the Hadi-controlled Yemeni military. Once this process is complete, the STC\u2019s military force will consist of an estimated 52,000 south Yemeni troops and sizable numbers of Emirati technical advisors. This level of military strength effectively prevents pro-Hadi or Houthi forces from expelling the UAE\u2019s proxies through military force.", "In order to repair its tarnished image and further its geopolitical agenda, the UAE will likely expand its involvement in the diplomatic resolution of the Yemeni civil war.", "Even though many international media outlets have conflated the UAE\u2019s troop reductions in Yemen with a military withdrawal, the UAE remains firmly committed to advancing its strategic interests in Yemen. The UAE is likely to preserve its hegemony over southern Yemen and could exert considerable influence over Yemen\u2019s future political trajectory.

These actions will help ensure that UAE-Saudi Arabia relations are not severely damaged by Abu Dhabi\u2019s unilateral withdrawal and that the UAE will secure its interests in an eventual Yemeni peace settlement.", "In spite of the UAE\u2019s troop drawdown from Yemen, initial reports suggest that Abu Dhabi will maintain a military presence in its base on al-Mukalla, a former al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) stronghold that was overrun by the UAE in 2016.", "As Abu Dhabi\u2019s hegemony over Aden complements its rising military presence on the Red Sea and Horn of Africa, the UAE will ensure that its troop drawdown does not weaken its influence in southern Yemen. The Security Belt, a UAE-aligned south Yemeni paramilitary force, continues to maintain a formidable military presence throughout southern Yemen. The UAE has also reportedly directed the STC to establish a parallel army to the Hadi-controlled Yemeni military. Once this process is complete, the STC\u2019s military force will consist of an estimated 52,000 south Yemeni troops and sizable numbers of Emirati technical advisors. This level of military strength effectively prevents pro-Hadi or Houthi forces from expelling the UAE\u2019s proxies through military force.", "In order to repair its tarnished image and further its geopolitical agenda, the UAE will likely expand its involvement in the diplomatic resolution of the Yemeni civil war.", "Even though many international media outlets have conflated the UAE\u2019s troop reductions in Yemen with a military withdrawal, the UAE remains firmly committed to advancing its strategic interests in Yemen. The UAE is likely to preserve its hegemony over southern Yemen and could exert considerable influence over Yemen\u2019s future political trajectory.

The Security Belt, a UAE-aligned south Yemeni paramilitary force, continues to maintain a formidable military presence throughout southern Yemen. The UAE has also reportedly directed the STC to establish a parallel army to the Hadi-controlled Yemeni military. Once this process is complete, the STC\u2019s military force will consist of an estimated 52,000 south Yemeni troops and sizable numbers of Emirati technical advisors.
