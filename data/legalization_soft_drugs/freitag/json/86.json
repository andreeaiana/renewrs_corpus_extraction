It finds that the protracted conflict has, on the one hand, pushed more women into the workforce and new labor markets, in some cases into professions previously dominated by men. While some women have established new enterprises, often home-based businesses, others have engaged in poorly paid physical work in response to the economic crisis and the loss of male breadwinners. On the other hand, the war has imposed new constraints on an already low women\u2019s participation rate.", "This policy brief recommends that micro-economic initiatives to bring women into the workforce must be accompanied by long-term efforts to address socio-economic structures that have historically constrained women\u2019s access to the workforce. Interventions must be guided by local consultations with women and men from all demographics, and must promote work that is fairly paid and provides security and social protection. Quota systems could ensure that women play an active role in recovery and reconstruction efforts; women must also be engaged at all decision-making levels in peace building efforts and in post-conflict Yemen.", "Introduction", "Yemen has one of the lowest female labor force participation rates in the world. The conflict-driven economic collapse has devastated Yemen\u2019s labor market, and available data suggest that working women were initially harder hit by the conflict than their male counterparts; proportionally, more women lost their jobs while women-owned businesses were more vulnerable to closing down. Subsequently, however, the prolonged war has pushed more women into the workforce, often through financial necessity due to the economic crisis and the loss of male breadwinners rather than any planned economic empowerment for women.", "During the conflict, women have started new enterprises, often home-based businesses, or entered professions like waitressing or retail which were previously dominated by men. The humanitarian response in Yemen has created new employment for women, while some women have been employed in security forces for parties to the conflict. Yemeni women have been pushed into poorly paid, informal physical labor like domestic work, while others have been forced into negative coping mechanisms such as begging.", "This policy brief surveys these emerging trends and introduces principles to guide efforts to sustain potential gains in women\u2019s labor force participation and to improve access to decent work for all women in post-conflict Yemen.", "Overview of the Labor Force in Yemen", "Yemen\u2019s labor force is largely uneducated and informal, with a low labor force participation rate.[1] It is characterized by a mismatch between workers\u2019 qualifications and their roles, and high unemployment.", "According to an ILO labor force survey conducted in 2013-2014, only 6 percent of women participated in the labor force prior to the conflict, while just 7 percent of jobs were held by women. In 2013, higher education levels were linked to greater workforce participation for women. Some 62.1 percent of women with a university education were part of the workforce in Yemen, compared with just 4.5 percent of those with a primary education or lower. The ILO survey found that of the 293,000 women employed before the conflict, around half worked in agriculture, either as dairy and livestock producers or field crop and vegetable growers, while around one third were employed in the service industry. More than one-third of women worked in family businesses, compared with less than one-tenth of men.", "Multiple factors have hindered women\u2019s entry into the workforce. Yemen has placed last in the Global Gender Gap report every year for the last decade, signalling the country\u2019s significant gender-based disparities.", "Cultural values limiting women\u2019s interaction with men outside the family have limited the types of work that women could perform, and women\u2019s employment options have been largely restricted to \u201cfeminine\u201d jobs such as clerks, secretaries, teachers and nurses.", "The Impact of War on Women in the Workforce", "The current conflict has devastated Yemen\u2019s economy, leaving millions of Yemenis unable to afford basic necessities; the economic collapse has driven the humanitarian catastrophe. Yemen\u2019s economy has contracted by an estimated 50 percent", "The conflict-driven challenges to the labor market have had multifaceted impacts on women. Research suggests that initially, the war affected a larger proportion of women in the labor force than men.

Despite speculation that such clashing agendas could lead to a major crack in the Arab coalition, that has not happened - at least not publicly.", "Weakness and division", "Iran and the Houthi rebels will likely further exploit the UAE\u2019s withdrawal for propaganda purposes. After several months of the Houthis demonstrating their advancements in drone and missile technology, proven by their attacks against strategic Saudi targets, the Iranians and Houthis will seek to portray the UAE\u2019s pullout as a sign of weakness and division on the Arab coalition\u2019s part.", "Ultimately, the UAE\u2019s withdrawal is informative of underlying divisions that were present in the Arab coalition from the outset. For Abu Dhabi, establishing a UAE-friendly administration in Aden has been more important than the question of Yemen\u2019s Houthi-controlled north.", "Yet, for Saudi Arabia, the prospects of the Houthis consolidating power in northern Yemen has direct implications for the kingdom\u2019s own border security - far more than for the UAE.", "Yet, with the UAE withdrawing most of its forces from Yemen, Abu Dhabi has left Riyadh with a major dilemma.

Abdulsalam reminded Trump of the U.S.\u2019 own involvement in Yemen", "For their part, the Houthis have never denied their political alliance with Iran, one of the few countries to consistently and openly challenge the legitimacy of the now more than four-year-old Saudi-led war on Yemen. Yet, the Houthis and the Iranian government both insist that Iran has never sent troops, military advisors or weapons to the Houthis and the Saudi-led Coalition \u2013 despite its control over large swaths of Yemen and the presence of its U.S-backed intelligence apparatus in the country \u2013 has never been able to provide hard evidence of an Iranian presence on the ground.", "As with any political alliance, a level of cooperation between Iran and the Houthis does exist. After the Houthis were successful in leading the movement to oust the Saudi-backed Hadi government from Yemen, Iran and the Houthisbrokered a deal to begin weekly passenger flights between the two countries. The flights, which only lasted for one week, drew the ire of Saudi Arabia who subsequently used military force put an end to flights between Tehran and Sana\u2019a and ultimately blockaded the Sana\u2019a Airport completely, leading to a crippling humanitarian crisis. Houthi government figures still occasionally fly to Iran to attend talks, and some are thought to own property in the county.", "A 2018 report by the United Nations Security Council accused Iran of illegally shipping fuel to the Houthi government in Yemen. The report claims that the fuel was then sold and the proceeds used to purchase weapons that the Houthis used in their fight against the Saudi-led coalition. UN experts say that by providing fuel to the Houthis, Iran is \u201cviolating a UN arms embargo\u201d and \u201cdirectly or indirectly providing missiles and drones to the Houthis.\u201d If Iran indeed did supply fuel to the Houthis, the move would be unlikely to change the balance of power in the Yemen war as Saudi Arabia spent over $80 billion on advanced weapons purchases from the United States in 2018 alone. They also enjoy U.S logistical and intelligence support in its war on the country.", "Houthi reliance on Tehran for weapons is also unnecessary as the country is so awash in weapons that the risk of attempting to smuggle them in from Iran would not only be a foolhardy venture for the Houthis, it would provide little benefit as the movement already has a sizable arsenal that it inherited from the government of former Houthi ally, the late Ali Abdullah Saleh.", "There is, undoubtedly, a convergence of interests between the Houthis and Iran", "Fiercely independent: the Houthis\u2019 grass roots", "The Houthis, who refer to themselves as Ansar Allah, have always been proud and fiercely independent.

It remains to be seen whether he would try to escalate our government\u2019s already illegal involvement in this war. To date, Trump has indulged the Saudi government on practically everything, and he has been echoing Saudi propaganda on Yemen for so many years that he may actually think that this has something to do with fighting Iran. It would be difficult to sell deeper U.S. involvement when even the UAE has decided that the war in northern Yemen isn\u2019t worth fighting. If it isn\u2019t important enough for the UAE, how could it possibly be important enough for the U.S.?", "The war on Yemen wasn\u2019t winnable for the Saudi coalition before, and now with the UAE\u2019s pullback it is certain that the coalition can\u2019t prevail", "The responsible thing for the U.S. to do is to take advantage of the Saudi coalition\u2019s weakness and use our leverage with Saudi Arabia to get a general ceasefire and peace negotiations.
