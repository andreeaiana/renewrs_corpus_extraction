The saga of this facility is a microcosm of the conflict between the Huthis and the internationally recognised government (IRG) on access to finance prioritising it over the welfare of citizens. It is yet another example of their shocking indifference for the life and welfare of people and their lack of concern about avoidable deaths and destruction.", "What is the FSO SAFER? It is a vessel which has been moored off Ras Issa in the Red Sea since 1988 and was used as an export terminal for the oil produced in Mareb. Since 2015 there have been no exports as this terminal is under Huthi control while the oil fields are under the control of the government. It contains 1.14 million barrels of crude oil in 34 storage compartments. For the past four years, it has been rusting and increasingly deteriorating, so the risk of explosion or rupturing and sinking has worsened daily. Conditions at sea accelerate the deterioration process and thus the risks.", "Such a spill would be a major threat to the marine environment, fisheries, desalination plants in the Red Sea, and coastal areas. It would cause major health risks to the population in the entire region and possibly close access to ports, let alone the impact on the livelihoods of all. In brief it would bring about a major humanitarian and environmental disaster throughout the states bordering the Red Sea, well beyond Yemen itself.", "The Huthis have asked the UN for help in assessing the situation and selling the oil; emptying the vessel would end the risks involved and prevent disaster. Each time agreement was about to be reached, discussions collapsed simply because the Huthis and the Hadi government failed to agree on the use of the funds from the sale of this oil. They prefer to risk the lives of the population and cause a major environmental disaster to losing this potential income. The result is that there is no income, Yemenis remain without salaries, and disaster could strike at any time. The issue was raised again at the January 2020 UNSC meeting, but there is no indication of action being taken. This could bring Yemen back to world headlines anytime.", "Small changes in the details of the water crisis.", "While the SAFER remains a potentially explosive issue, other environmental issues continue as \u2018normal.\u2019 In particular, access to domestic water supplies is mentioned in occasional media coverage, recalling that water scarcity is one of Yemen\u2019s main long-term issues.

Vielmehr nimmt das Land heute weit jenseits seiner eigenen Grenzen Einfluss und hat zuletzt durch seinen Teilabzug aus dem Jemen im Jahr 2019 gezeigt, dass es in der Lage ist, auch gegen\u00fcber Saudi-Arabien einen unabh\u00e4ngigen Kurs zu verfolgen.", "Aus diesen Beobachtungen ergibt sich jedoch die Frage nach den Grundlinien und Priorit\u00e4ten der emiratischen Au\u00dfenpolitik.

Die in dieser Studie vertretene These ist, dass die neue Regionalpolitik der Emirate trotz vieler reaktiver Elemente von drei deutlich erkennbaren Leitlinien gepr\u00e4gt ist:", "Erstens bek\u00e4mpfen die VAE die Islamisten in der Region, weil sie in der Muslimbruderschaft, der gr\u00f6\u00dften und wichtigsten Bewegung des politischen Islam in der arabischen Welt, eine ernsthafte Bedrohung f\u00fcr die Regimestabilit\u00e4t im eigenen Land ausgemacht haben.", "Zweitens richtet sich die neue emiratische Regionalpolitik gegen die iranische Expansion im Nahen Osten. Seit 2015, als die VAE und Saudi-Arabien einen Krieg gegen die lose mit dem Iran verb\u00fcndeten Huthi-Rebellen begannen, ist der Jemen aus Sicht Abu Dhabis der wichtigste Schauplatz dieses Konflikts. Die antiiranische Dimension der emiratischen Au\u00dfenpolitik ist aber deutlich schw\u00e4cher ausgepr\u00e4gt als die Abneigung gegen\u00fcber den Islamisten.", "Drittens ist Abu Dhabi an der Kontrolle der Seewege vom Golf von Aden in das Rote Meer gelegen. Zu diesem Zweck haben die VAE seit 2015 mehrere jemenitische H\u00e4fen und Inseln \u00fcbernommen und Basen in Assab in Eritrea und Berbera in Somaliland eingerichtet. Auf diese Weise haben sie ein kleines Seereich rund um den Golf von Oman gegr\u00fcndet und sich als eine Regionalmacht im S\u00fcdwesten der arabischen Halbinsel und am Horn von Afrika etabliert.", "Die Priorit\u00e4ten der F\u00fchrung in Abu Dhabi zeigten sich in aller Deutlichkeit im Juli 2019, als die VAE einen Gro\u00dfteil ihrer Truppen aus dem Jemen abzogen und die meisten Positionen lokalen Verb\u00fcndeten \u00fcberlie\u00dfen.

Bin Zayid ist seit 2003 zum Architekten der emiratischen Regionalmachtpolitik geworden. Zweitens wirkt sich eine inneremiratische Machtverschiebung aus, in deren Folge das vor allem kommerziell orientierte Dubai an Einfluss verlor und Abu Dhabi den au\u00dfen- und sicherheitspolitischen Entscheidungsprozess dominierte. Und drittens setzt die emiratische Regierung seit 2011 innenpolitisch auf Repression, so dass sie keinen internen Widerstand gegen ihre Au\u00dfenpolitik f\u00fcrchten muss.
