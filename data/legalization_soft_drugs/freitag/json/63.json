Lest we forget, Hadi was the vice-president of a corrupt and dictatorial regime that was toppled by the infliction of the Arab Spring, his 2-year interim appointment ran out in 2014 and was unduly extended by the National Dialogue Conference without the benefit of an election. Irrespective, the Saudi-led coalition, whose own history is rife with repeated palace coups and authoritarianism, used Hadi\u2019s call for external intervention against the Houthis to pulverize an entire nation", "The question for the Saudis now, who are still reeling by the negative results of their murder of the dissident Khashoggi in their consulate in Istanbul last October, is how they can continue business as usual with respect to Hadi, when in fact the mask has fallen and the man is increasingly a liability rather than an asset for Riyadh\u2019s objectives in Yemen? It is possible that the reported rifts between Saudi Arabia and UAE over Aden is to some extent exaggerated and that is why the Saudi forces did not rush to assist the government forces during the August 7-10 clashes in Aden, letting the chips fall where they may. Of course, the Saudis have to save face by pretending that they are still fully committed to the Hadi government, which in the best circumstance can survive by allowing a huge influx of STC and thus turning into the latter\u2019s Trojan horse.", "Another big question is how the changes in Aden affect the trajectory of war in Yemen? Can the South turn into an \u201cisland of peace and stability\u201d under the STC control, or will it simply sow the seeds of another north/south conflict down the road?", "From the vantage point of north Yemen, the resource-rich south Yemen should not be independent as this would exact a toll on the north\u2019s economy.

Today, the incoherence of their dual approach, in giving political support to a government of \u201cnational unity\u201d while aiding the separatists, has reaped a bitter harvest, which has been described by some as a \u201ccivil war within a civil war,\u201d although the basic problem with this description is overlooking that the Yemen war is first and foremost a war of aggression by a group of authoritarian oil monarchies against their poor yet defiant neighbor \u2013 by Kaveh L.

Such reporting from the kingdom\u2019s press platforms seems to suggest that the official narrative in Saudi Arabia is that Riyadh and Abu Dhabi\u2019s differences are merely tactical and that both GCC capitals remain close. It is difficult to predict how real differences in Emirati and Saudi foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis southern Yemen will impact Abu Dhabi and Riyadh\u2019s bilateral ties. Nonetheless, such division within the anti-Houthi front cannot be ignored, especially in light of recent events.", "Yemen\u2019s Southern Transition Council (STC) maintains that Muslim Brotherhood elements have infiltrated Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi\u2019s government.

Meanwhile, Hadi\u2019s loyalists depict the STC as having carried out an illegitimate coup against Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government. The extent to which there can be any common ground between these sides remains to be seen.", "Experts have noted that the southern separatists are attempting to appeal to the Saudi leadership. Their main means of doing so is emphasizing their anti-Houthi/anti-Iranian credentials, pointing to how forces in the south have played a central role in terms of working with the Arab coalition to fight the Tehran-sponsored insurgents. Nonetheless, it is difficult to imagine a common opposition to Ansurallah being the basis of a problem-free relationship between Riyadh and the Emirati-backed southern separatists.", "As long as the Saudis insist on maintaining Yemeni unity while the Emiratis support southern secessionists, there will be tension between them. Such competing agendas will inevitably create an increasingly complicated situation in the war-torn country.", "It will be important to look at how Abu Dhabi and Riyadh manage their conflicting interests in southern Yemen. One of the key factors that will determinate how such tensions evolve is the extent to which the Emirati leadership goes all out in terms of supporting the southern separatists in Aden.

These acts hindered restoring normal life and services, security and economic situations of our people, in spit of the generous support provided by the Arab Coalition.  \u2022 We declare our full support of all measures taken by the southern resistance to protect our people and restore security and stability all over Aden as a necessary measure to eliminate terrorism and extreme elements.  \u2022 We demand president Aidarous Kassem Al-Zubaidi, president of the Southern Transitional Council and Supreme Commander of Southern Resistance Forces, who was delegated publicly by Aden Historic Declaration on May 4th, 2017, to assume his historical responsibility delegated to him by the people to restore our independent state.  \u2022 We demand the international society and the Arab Coalition to turn the administration of the south to the southern transitional council as a representative of the southern people.  \u2022 We demand the international society and the Arab Coalition led by Saudi Arabia and UAE to respect the will of our southern people as a major partner with the Arab Coalition in facing the Iranian expansion in the region and fighting terrorism and to achieve the goals of the Arab Coalition in restoring stability of the region and the whole world.  \u2022 We welcome and appreciate the invitation of Saudi Arabia to the Southern Transitional Council to talk with the legitimacy as we actually appreciate this act.  \u2022 We demand all sectors of the southern society to preserve the gains and achievement of southern resistance in addition to preserving public and private properties and fostering the spirit and values of civil culture, peaceful coexistence and social security and safety.  \u2022 We appreciate the heroic deeds of our southern resistance and its glorious victories and achievements and we demand them to continue clearing off all southern territories from terrorism and occupation in Bihan, Hadhramaut valley, Mukiras and everywhere in our beloved south.", "We ask God for mercy to martyrs and quick healing to the injured Long Live the South, Free and Independent", "https://en.smanews.org/final-statement-issued-by-the_million_march_of_empowerment_and_persistnce-in-aden", "and", "(* A P)", "\"Constitutional Declaration\" in Aden.

Its creation upended the status quo that had dominated South Arabia for more than 1,000 years, pitting a new generation of revolutionaries against a staunchly conservative religious and tribal class.", "The original conflicts that precipitated the country\u2019s first civil war during the 1960s remain at the core of the current conflict between the Houthi movement and the Republic of Yemen.

It should also, of course, be seen in the context of the extrajudicial execution of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018. The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has recently concluded that this was a premeditated murder for which Saudi Arabia bears state responsibility, and that a number of high-level Saudi officials including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman are personally implicated. Accordingly, she has determined that the killing was a clear violation of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s right to life, and that the gruesome circumstances also amounted to a violation of the prohibitions on torture and on enforced and involuntary disappearances.4 Whilst this context is important, this report focuses on those who have recently been executed in Saudi Arabia itself, who are currently on death row in Saudi Arabia, or who are at real risk of being sentenced to death. In particular, this report draws attention to the plight of political activists and minors who have been executed or are the subject of threatened executions.", "In preparing this report, a number of persons directly affected by recent and threatened executions have been interviewed, including relatives and lawyers of victims. Whilst some are prepared for information and quotes to be attributed to them as set out below in Section E, a number wish to remain anonymous due to concerns for their safety and that of their family members. The individuals interviewed are willing to assist the international fact-finding mission which is the subject of Recommendation 4 below, as well as the relevant Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council.", "The evidence reviewed demonstrates frequent and heavy-handed recourse to the death penalty by Saudi Arabia in recent months. At least 149 people were executed in 2018, with at minimum 46 remaining on death row at the end of the year. It seems that many of those 46 individuals have now been executed, with at least 134 death sentences having been carried out between 1 January and 20 July 2019 alone.6 Should executions continue at this rate, the 2019 death toll will far exceed all previous recorded totals.", "A large number of deeply disturbing themes emerge from the evidence relating to the 2019 executions. 7 A significant proportion of those executed were political dissidents, and a number were children at the time of their alleged offending. Three were women. Many were arraigned on ill-defined charges of \u2018espionage\u2019 and \u2018terrorism\u2019 pursuant to unacceptably vague and broad laws. These, and many others, had been convicted only of non-violent or non-lethal crimes. Victims were frequently held incommunicado for prolonged periods and tortured, and the domestic proceedings against them were characterised by gross violations of the right to a fair trial. Some of those killed had been the subject of international media attention and/or communications by the Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council. In one particularly alarming case, an individual had been designated as \u2018no longer at risk\u2019 by the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions on the strength of assertions by the Saudi Arabian authorities, before ultimately being killed in the mass execution which took place on 23 April 2019. The mode of killing, too, is shocking. Executions are usually by way of public beheading, and have increasingly taken place en masse. In some cases, the mutilated bodies of those killed have been left on public display for extended periods, rather than being disposed of swiftly and with dignity. I was informed by those representing families that the remains of the deceased were routinely not returned to them, and they were frequently not even told where their loved ones had been buried.", "Each of these features connotes a grave violation of international human rights norms. Most pressingly, the execution of persons who were minors at the time of their alleged offences, or for the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, or following unfair trials, amounts to a clear violation of the right to life itself. Further, the mode of killing is frequently inconsistent with international law, rendering the execution arbitrary and in breach of the prohibition on cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.", "Dozens more are currently at imminent risk of execution, in circumstances where their killing would be clearly unlawful.", "It is important to note that Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent excessive use of the death penalty comes in the midst of a concerted campaign against human rights defenders and political activists.", "https://arabi21.com/UP/SEVEN%20Earth/KSA%20-%20Report%20on%20Use%20of%20the%20Death%20Penalty%202019%20.pdf", "cp1b Am wichtigsten: Kampf um Hodeidah / Most important: Hodeidah battle", "(A K pS)", "Houthi group targeted the villages of Tehtya district in Hodeida city, damaging a number of civilian houses and triggering fear and panic among the people.", "https://twitter.com/BelqeesRights/status/1162799868143910912", "(A K pS)", "Houthi militia targets civilian houses in Hodeida with mortar shells", "http://en.26sepnews.net/2019/08/17/1-47/", "(A K pS)", "Houthis target civilian and military areas in Hodeidah", "http://en.adenpress.news/news/13043", "(A K pH)", "Mass protests condemn UN silence on Durayhimi siege", "Protesters condemn \"UN complicity\" and call for decisive action to lift siege", "Residents of Hodeidah province have on Friday condemned what they deemed UN complicity in the siege imposed on Durayhimi city for almost two years, as well as the", "https://www.uprising.today/mass-protests-condemn-un-silence-on-durayhimi-siege/", "(A K pH)", "In Hodeidah, a civilian was injured in At-tohayta district.
