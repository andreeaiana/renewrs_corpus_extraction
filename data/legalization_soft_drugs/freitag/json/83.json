But to what extent are the Houthis able to target them?", "The sophistication, precision, and range (Abqaiq being 1,150 kilometres north of Yemen) of the September 14 attacks far exceed anything the Houthis have done before. Iran, however, is known to have been supplying and training the Houthis in using and managing drones. They operate primarily the Qasef-1 attack drone, which is identical to the Iranian Ababil-2/T, and can deliver a 45kg warhead up to 150 kilometres.", "Analysts have counted 58 Houthi drone strikes on Saudi Arabia, of which most targeted airports in nearby Abha, Najran and Jizan. But drone strikes on an airport in Abu Dhabi in July 2018 and on the East-West pipeline in May 2019 (over 800 kilometres away) show an upgrade in sophistication and range. In late 2018, the UN found the use of a new drone they named \u2018UAV-X\u2019 (which may be what the Houthis refer to as \u2018Samad-2/3\u2019), conceivably able to carry an 18 kg warhead with shrapnel up to 1,500 kilometres.", "Saudi officials have also reported 200 ballistic missile attacks, but the exact number is likely to be significantly higher.

Iran also provides advisers that assist in construction and tactics.", "Revenues from the Saudi oil industry accounts for 87% of budget revenues, 42% of GDP, and 90% of export earnings \u2013 this puts into perspective how sensitive Saudi Arabia is to disruptions in oil flows. A fact not lost on the Houthis. High-impact attacks, like the ones on Abqaiq and Khurais, are highly unlikely to become a regular event.", "However, it is highly likely that the Houthis will increasingly execute low-impact attacks on critical Saudi oil infrastructure. Saudi Arabia can compensate for disruption inflows as it holds a lot of oil in store, and has a lot of spare capacity in pipelines and stabilisation plants. But a large number of low-impact attacks would cause significant damage over the medium to long-term as cost of repairs and defences accumulate.
