Little is clear about the Houthi leadership, aside from the fact that Abdulmalik al-Houthi is the rebel group's current leader. Houthi field commanders do not seem to agree on key ideological and religious principles. The Houthis' numbers range from the hundreds to the thousands, though it is difficult to determine how many of these adhere to Houthi ideology and how many are tribesmen who have joined the Houthis' fight for other reasons. Numerous organizations have documented the Houthis' use of child soldiers, as well as violations of international humanitarian law such as looting, forced evacuations, and executions. Contrary to ROYG claims that Iran is arming the Houthis, most analysts report that the Houthis obtain their weapons from the Yemeni black market and even from the ROYG military itself.

(S/NF) Contrary to ROYG claims that Iran is arming the Houthis, most local political analysts report that the Houthis obtain their weapons from the Yemeni black market and even from the ROYG military itself. According to a British diplomat, there are numerous credible reports that ROYG military commanders were selling weapons to the Houthis in the run-up to the Sixth War. An ICG report on the Sa'ada conflict from May 2009 quoted NSB director Ali Mohammed al-Ansi saying, \"Iranians are not arming the Houthis. The weapons they use are Yemeni. Most actually come from fighters who fought against the socialists during the 1994 war and then sold them.\" Mohammed Azzan, presidential advisor for Sa'ada affairs, told PolOff on August 16 that the Houthis easily obtain weapons inside Yemen, either from battlefield captures or by buying them from corrupt military commanders and soldiers. Azzan said that the military \"covers up its failure\" by saying the weapons come from Iran. According to Jamal Abdullah al-Shami of the Democracy School, there is little external oversight of the military's large and increasing budget, so it is easy for members of the military to illegally sell weapons. 13. (S/NF) ROYG officials assert that the Houthis' possession and use of Katyusha rockets is evidence of support from Iran and Hizballah, arguing that these rockets are not available in Yemeni arms markets nor ROYG stockpiles. (Comment: Given Yemen's robust arms markets, especially in Sa'ada, it is possible that Katyushas are available on the black market even if they are not in ROYG stockpiles. According to sensitive reporting, there is at least one instance of Somali extremists purchasing Katyusha rockets in Yemen in 2007. End Comment.)

Ahmad al-Assiri told National Public Radio (NPR) in an interview that aired this morning. He was responding to a question about a March 15, 2016 airstrike on a market in the northern Yemeni town of Mastaba that killed at least 97 civilians. A colleague and I had visited the site in late March and found remnants of a United States-supplied 2,000 pound bomb, one of several used in the attack. We even shot a video in the demolished market. On camera I say, \u201cI am standing here in the remains of Mastaba market\u2026.\u201d", "Human Rights Watch published a report on our findings, calling on the Saudis to investigate the apparently unlawful attack \u2013 a possible war crime. It was one of the deadliest single attacks in the campaign by the Saudi-led coalition to oust northern Houthi rebels and their allies from the capital, Sanaa, and other areas. At least 3,000 civilians have died over the past year, most from airstrikes.", "NPR host Mary Louise Kelly pressed the general on Human Rights Watch\u2019s findings: \u201cThey went, they saw it.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d al-Assiri responded. \u201cNo one get[s] to Yemen without permission of the coalition.\u201d He added that he hopes \u201cHuman Right Watch and the other NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] come to the coalition for permission. We will send them down to investigate.\u201d", "In fact, this two-week trip was the fourth I had made to Yemen since the beginning of the war in March 2015. Given what I go through to get into Yemen, al-Assiri\u2019s statement was laughable. Since the war started, all Yemenia Airway flights to Sanaa touch down in Saudi Arabia, where Saudi immigration officers board the plane, search the baggage, and selectively question passengers. Each time, I was one of the only passengers to have my passport confiscated for the layover, without a word of explanation. The Saudis know every time I visit Yemen.", "But there\u2019s nothing laughable about the situation in Yemen. Over the course of my trips, I\u2019ve investigated dozens of airstrikes by the coalition that have killed at least 670 civilians, as well as other serious abuses by all the parties to the conflict. We and other human rights groups have been on the ground investigating them. Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners have an obligation under the laws of war to investigate alleged violations by their forces \u2013 but there\u2019s no indication they\u2019ve done so.", "General al-Assiri has been in Washington, DC this month, no doubt to drum up support for resupplying the bombs dropped on Mastaba and elsewhere, and other weapons. There\u2019s no reason to believe that what he says about alleged coalition atrocities is any more accurate than his portrayal of Human Rights Watch investigations.

Nonetheless, HRW and others have investigated the effects of the coalition\u2019s indiscriminate bombing campaign along with the crimes committed by all parties to the conflict. They have ample proof that the Saudi-led coalition has carried out numerous strikes on civilian areas in violation of international law.", "The Saudis have moved from brazenly denying that civilians were killed by their attacks to feigning concern for the victims, but it doesn\u2019t change that they have been working overtime to avoid accountability for their crimes over the last year.

The interviewer also asks whether the \u201cSaudi intervention has improved things,\u201d but that is the wrong question to ask.

Although salient, these cleavages cannot fully explain the complexity of the Yemeni scenario. For instance, the South is not a homogenous actor because there are regional and tribal identities to feed local agendas. In Yemen, the Civil War in 1994 and then the 2011 Arab uprising have exacerbated the dynamic yet convoluted conflict, which has compelled several Yemenis to call for regional autonomy. This complicated situation is particularly evident in south-eastern, Sunni-populated governorates of Hadhramaut and Al-Mahra.", "Yemen\u2019s \u2018far East\u2019 has always been marginalised by the central, northern-driven elite, especially on issues concerning revenue redistribution, economic opportunities, and political representation.

While the Houthis did not yet represent a military threat in that they were just a tribe of northern Yemen, it is their Zaidism, their determination to remain true to Yemen\u2019s religious tradition and their rejection of Wahhabism which prompted Riyadh\u2019s wrath.", "Al-Islah was always meant as a buffer against both President Saleh\u2019s power and Zaidism.", "Headed by al-Ahmar\u2019s tribe, al-Islah became an extension of Riyadh\u2019s power in Yemen, the contender in many ways to President Saleh\u2019s own tribe, and own family. While Saleh appointed his own family members to Yemen\u2019s key military and political positions, he still had to accommodate al-Islah and offer its leadership a share of the political pie.

It is often from chaos that new order can be shaped and moulded to existence. 2011 was meant to introduce a new order to Southern Arabia \u2026 If not for the arrival of the Houthis, Riyadh would have succeeded in bringing Yemen to kneel to its imperial will.", "But why would Riyadh want President Saleh gone when its officials did everything they could to protect him? Good question! Did they though \u2026. Who did they protect? The man, or the power he represented? You see while Riyadh might have cared little for Saleh\u2019s life, he was still the guardian of a legitimacy the kingdom could not accept to see threaten. More importantly President Saleh had been earmarked to transition Yemen into Riyadh\u2019s hands \u2013 Saudi Arabia understood only too well how quickly Yemen could have fallen into real chaos if not for a strong hand to hold it together. Chaos was only allowed if directed properly.", "While I will not claim to have been privy to Riyadh\u2019s political whispers, I will venture a theory on why Riyadh wanted to see Saleh gone. It wasn\u2019t so much President Saleh who represented a threat but his appointed successor: General Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh - the president\u2019s eldest son and head of the now-debunked Republican Guards. A central military figure, Gen. Ahmed Saleh was \u2026 and still is, a well-loved figure. Not only that but the man stands for a Yemen, millions would like to see manifest.", "If the general is very much his father\u2019s son in that he understands the inner and outer politics of Yemen, he is also a modern educated man who wants to see his country reclaim its leading position in Southern Arabia. Where President Saleh was in many ways a tribesman turned president, Gen. Ahmed Saleh is a military man ambitioning to turn Yemen into Arabia\u2019s first functioning republic by taming both tribalism and Wahhabism. Needless to say that the kingdom had an issue with that. Not only does Riyadh want to perpetuate Yemen\u2019s tribalism, since it allows for greater control, but it also wants to see Wahhabism becomes Yemen\u2019s state religion.", "The general\u2019s accession to the presidency would make all the above impossible \u2013 hence his fall from political and military grace.

Most actually come from fighters who fought against the socialists during the 1994 war and then sold them.\" Mohammed Azzan, presidential advisor for Sa'ada affairs, told PolOff on August 16 that the Houthis easily obtain weapons inside Yemen, either from battlefield captures or by buying them from corrupt military commanders and soldiers. Azzan said that the military \"covers up its failure\" by saying the weapons come from Iran. According to Jamal Abdullah al-Shami of the Democracy School, there is little external oversight of the military's large and increasing budget, so it is easy for members of the military to illegally sell weapons. 13.

A colleague and I had visited the site in late March and found remnants of a United States-supplied 2,000 pound bomb, one of several used in the attack. We even shot a video in the demolished market.

We will send them down to investigate.\u201d", "In fact, this two-week trip was the fourth I had made to Yemen since the beginning of the war in March 2015. Given what I go through to get into Yemen, al-Assiri\u2019s statement was laughable. Since the war started, all Yemenia Airway flights to Sanaa touch down in Saudi Arabia, where Saudi immigration officers board the plane, search the baggage, and selectively question passengers. Each time, I was one of the only passengers to have my passport confiscated for the layover, without a word of explanation. The Saudis know every time I visit Yemen.", "But there\u2019s nothing laughable about the situation in Yemen.

Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners have an obligation under the laws of war to investigate alleged violations by their forces \u2013 but there\u2019s no indication they\u2019ve done so.", "General al-Assiri has been in Washington, DC this month, no doubt to drum up support for resupplying the bombs dropped on Mastaba and elsewhere, and other weapons.

While the Houthis did not yet represent a military threat in that they were just a tribe of northern Yemen, it is their Zaidism, their determination to remain true to Yemen\u2019s religious tradition and their rejection of Wahhabism which prompted Riyadh\u2019s wrath.", "Al-Islah was always meant as a buffer against both President Saleh\u2019s power and Zaidism.", "Headed by al-Ahmar\u2019s tribe, al-Islah became an extension of Riyadh\u2019s power in Yemen, the contender in many ways to President Saleh\u2019s own tribe, and own family. While Saleh appointed his own family members to Yemen\u2019s key military and political positions, he still had to accommodate al-Islah and offer its leadership a share of the political pie. As the decades rolled in, Yemen came to be governed by both al-Ahmar, and the Saleh. Smack down in the middle was Yemen.", "Yemen 2011 uprising came to upset this balance of power. Yemen uprising was engineered to upset this balance of power, so that a new one could rise.

It is often from chaos that new order can be shaped and moulded to existence. 2011 was meant to introduce a new order to Southern Arabia \u2026 If not for the arrival of the Houthis, Riyadh would have succeeded in bringing Yemen to kneel to its imperial will.", "But why would Riyadh want President Saleh gone when its officials did everything they could to protect him? Good question! Did they though \u2026. Who did they protect? The man, or the power he represented? You see while Riyadh might have cared little for Saleh\u2019s life, he was still the guardian of a legitimacy the kingdom could not accept to see threaten. More importantly President Saleh had been earmarked to transition Yemen into Riyadh\u2019s hands \u2013 Saudi Arabia understood only too well how quickly Yemen could have fallen into real chaos if not for a strong hand to hold it together. Chaos was only allowed if directed properly.", "While I will not claim to have been privy to Riyadh\u2019s political whispers, I will venture a theory on why Riyadh wanted to see Saleh gone. It wasn\u2019t so much President Saleh who represented a threat but his appointed successor: General Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh - the president\u2019s eldest son and head of the now-debunked Republican Guards. A central military figure, Gen. Ahmed Saleh was \u2026 and still is, a well-loved figure. Not only that but the man stands for a Yemen, millions would like to see manifest.", "If the general is very much his father\u2019s son in that he understands the inner and outer politics of Yemen, he is also a modern educated man who wants to see his country reclaim its leading position in Southern Arabia. Where President Saleh was in many ways a tribesman turned president, Gen. Ahmed Saleh is a military man ambitioning to turn Yemen into Arabia\u2019s first functioning republic by taming both tribalism and Wahhabism. Needless to say that the kingdom had an issue with that. Not only does Riyadh want to perpetuate Yemen\u2019s tribalism, since it allows for greater control, but it also wants to see Wahhabism becomes Yemen\u2019s state religion.", "The general\u2019s accession to the presidency would make all the above impossible \u2013 hence his fall from political and military grace.

Why did the Saudi regime assembled a coalition to attack Yemen that included 10 Arab regimes and Senegal from Africa combined with massive supports from the US and UK?

And why did the Saudi-led coalition killed close to 10,000 Yemeni civilians and destroyed the country\u2019s infrastructures and historical sites if talks and negotiations from the beginning can resolve the disagreements? The right conclusion is that the Saudi regime assumed this new position due to its gross failure to realize its objectives through the war it imposed on Yemen, its present pathetic financial state and the growing discontent and dissent in Saudi Arabia. It is an open secret that the Saudi and its allied forces fought alongside AlQaeda and ISIS in Yemen against the brave and courageous Houthi freedom fighters but now they claimed they want to concentrate on the fight against Al-Qaeda and ISIS so as to give the US the pretext to station troops in Yemeni bases.

Once migrants/refugees landed in Yemen, they would be abducted and taken to smuggling dens for weeks on end, until they paid extortion fees to secure their release. If they were unable to pay they would be physically beaten, raped, tortured or put to work before eventually being released. Oftentimes migrants travelling further north after their release would be recaptured by other smugglers and go through a similar process.", "The threat of abduction and kidnapping for ransom remains a significant threat for those moving, and particularly Ethiopian nationals who are perceived to be able to pay ransoms more readily than their Somali counterparts.", "RMMS monthly summaries continue to include reports on the abduction of migrants/refugees arriving via the Red Sea coasts.

For Ethiopian migrants (who now account for 85 percent of people moving to Yemen) the Red Sea route is quicker, and cheaper, which may explain why so many still choose to use that passage.

This is a signal by the CBY for the market to show it is recognizing the problem of the scarcity of hard currencies and is willing to adapt in order to regain the trust of the market.", "While the foreign reserves of the CBY went down from $5.35 billion in 2013 to $4.6 billion in November 2014, the war and the cutting of sources of foreign currency \u2014 except for the remittances from Yemenis abroad \u2014 contributed in lowering the foreign reserves to $2.1 billion by the end of 2015, according to a report by Yemen's Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation.", "Although some might want to blame the depletion of foreign reserves entirely on the Houthi rebel group, which is in fact withdrawing substantial amounts of money from the CBY to finance its war efforts, the reason behind the dwindling foreign reserves is primarily the ever-rising demand for foreign currency in the country.", "The depletion of the CBY foreign reserves limits the range of anti-inflationary monetary policies the CBY can implement to stop a free fall of the value of the Yemeni rial. This limitation led the Houthis to arrest many owners of currency exchange shops who did not abide by the CBY\u2019s official exchange rate. If the CBY cannot stabilize the value of the Yemeni rial, more capital will leave the country for more stable economies, prices of basic commodities will go up beyond the 30% inflation rate the country witnessed in 2015, real wages and purchasing power will decline even if nominal wages were raised and the gap between the poor and rich, who own assets in foreign currencies, will drastically widen.", "Even if the CBY continues to set new policies to tackle rising inflation and the devaluation of the Yemeni rial, its policies will not be effective as long as there is no political will to stabilize the situation.
