However, on this occasion, I am writing to share with you a compilation of Amnesty International\u2019s published work on the Saudi Arabia-led Coalition\u2019s violations of international humanitarian law and of international human rights law in Yemen to date. The violations include disproportionate or otherwise indiscriminate attacks that have killed or injured civilians and destroyed or damaged civilian objects; and the use of banned weapons, such as cluster munitions.", "The work we are presenting to you is based on investigations carried out both in person and remotely. Between February 2015 and September 2019, Amnesty International conducted eight field missions in the north and south of Yemen, covering Sana\u2019a, Sa\u2019da, Amran, Hajjah, Hodeidah, Ibb, Ta\u2019iz, Dhale\u2019, Lahj, Abyan and Aden. When conducting investigations, Amnesty International gathers information by interviewing survivors, victims, witnesses, medical and NGO personnel, journalists, lawyers and government officials on the ground, either in person or by telecommunication. Amnesty International investigates and corroborates the circumstances and impact of attacks by examining satellite imagery, medical reports, physical evidence (such as remnants from munitions used in attacks), and photos and videos with the original metadata where available. Images of weapon remnants are analysed by weapons experts, and images of the impact site are sent for ballistic analysis where possible. In over half of these cases, we were able to access the sites in question.", "Since 2015, the Saudi Arabia-led Coalition has carried out scores of indiscriminate and disproportionate air strikes, hitting civilian objects on homes, schools, hospitals, markets, mosques, weddings, funerals and prisons. Amnesty International documented 42 Coalition air strikes that appear to have violated international humanitarian law, many of which could amount to war crimes. These have resulted in 518 civilian deaths and 433 civilians injured.", "Our attached report begins with a recent concerning case documented by Amnesty International, in which the Coalition carried out an aerial attack on 28 June 2019, using a US-manufactured Raytheon Paveway laser-guided bomb that struck a residential home in village of Warzan in the governorate of Ta\u2019iz. The double-tap air strike killed six civilians in what appeared to be an unlawful air strike. The six members of the al-Kindi family killed in the 28 June airstrike were: Abdelqawi Abdu Ahmed al-Kindi (aged 62), his wife Hayat Abdu Seif Mohamed (50), and their two sons - Ahmed Abdelqawi Abdu Ahmed al-Kindi (28), Hussein Abdelqawi Abdu Ahmed al-Kindi (12), and their two grandchildren - Hamza Abdelqawi Abdu Ahmed al-Kindi (9), Ayman Ali Abdelqawi Abdu Ahmed al-Kindi (6). Abdelqawi and his son Ahmed both worked as construction contractors. Witnesses told Amnesty International there were no fighters or military vehicles in the vicinity of the al-Kindi home at the time of the attack.", "In another case documented by Amnesty, on 25 August 2017, a US-manufactured Raytheon Paveway laser-guided bomb struck civilian homes in Yemen\u2019s largest city, Sana\u2019a. A five-year old girl was the sole survivor in her family; she lost five siblings aged 2 to 10 and both her parents. We would welcome a chance to meet with you to discuss this and other cases in more depth and answer any questions.", "The Coalition has also used cluster munitions, lethal explosive weapons banned under international law. When launched, cluster bombs release dozens \u2013 sometimes hundreds \u2013 of small \u201cbomblets,\u201d which often lie unexploded and can cause horrific injuries long after the initial attack.

When conducting investigations, Amnesty International gathers information by interviewing survivors, victims, witnesses, medical and NGO personnel, journalists, lawyers and government officials on the ground, either in person or by telecommunication. Amnesty International investigates and corroborates the circumstances and impact of attacks by examining satellite imagery, medical reports, physical evidence (such as remnants from munitions used in attacks), and photos and videos with the original metadata where available.
