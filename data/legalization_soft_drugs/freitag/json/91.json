What Iran has done in recent months (assuming it was responsible for the various attacks on shipping in the Gulf and on the oil installations in Saudi Arabia), is to demonstrate to Saudi Arabia and the UAE not only the reach of its bombing capability, but its determination to extend the war to the Arab Gulf countries if Iran is attacked by Israel or the U.S. This can explain the recent Saudi and Emirati overtures to the Iranian regime. Both are suddenly expressing concern over the cost of war, if it were to erupt in their region.", "Limited Choices", "Bin Salman\u2019s economic promises have also failed to bear fruit for the Saudi population. He may now be facing rising resentment within the royal family itself", "MbS has limited choices. He can\u2019t afford to antagonize Trump and nor can he influence Trump one way or another regarding U.S. policies toward Iran.", "His best hope is that war does not take place, and that Khashoggi will be forgotten. That is very unlikely given the recent publicity surrounding the first anniversary of the killing. A man who made arrogance a key part of his personality, has been humiliated by Khashoggi, a former member of the Saudi royal entourage.", "But then again, Western governments have short memories when it comes to war crimes, assassinations and human rights violations by despots who are loyal to Western agendas. Any rehabilitation that MbS can work out will require him to sacrifice much of his original agenda. It will mean curtailing his appetite for war in Yemen and elsewhere and to drop his plans to confront Iran on all fronts.

Ansar Allah\u2019s recent operation with effective results took place while Ansar Allah\u2019s military structure after a period of difficult situation due to severe battles, now has reached the stage to take offensive steps. Ansar Allah\u2019s military strength in drone, missile, air defense, etc. were very primitive in compared with Saudi coalition equipment and the war was managed using weapons left from Ali Abdullah Saleh era. However in the last 2 years we see a significant development in Ansar Allah\u2019s capabilities. Recent operations of Ansar Allah, such as attacking Aramco, are complicated ones. Considering Ansar Allah\u2019s situation and strength, operation \u2018Nasr Min Allah\u2018 is considered a large size operation but does not solve the war in Yemen alone.
