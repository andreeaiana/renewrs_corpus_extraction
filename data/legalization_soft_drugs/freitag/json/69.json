It also follows a depressingly predictable pattern in which accountability is dodged by blaming either the victims of an attack or malfunctions that relieve the SELC of any culpability.", "In another press conference held in January 2019, the JIAT attempted to shift responsibility for a June 2018 strike by the SELC onto MSF, falsely accusing the organisation of failing to take the appropriate steps to avoid being targeted. The strike resulted in the near total destruction of a newly-established Cholera Treatment Centre in Abs, which had been due to serve a catchment population of more than one1 million people.", "Despite repeated calls by humanitarian actors for credible investigations into such events, the JIAT has consistently failed to report promptly and transparently on its findings, leaving both humanitarian agencies and individual victims of SELC attacks with no recourse to justice or accountability.

With only half of health facilities in Yemen fully functional, more than 11 million people in acute need, and outbreaks of cholera and other easily preventable diseases occurring regularly across the country, access to medical facilities is crucial for the civilian population.", "MSF reiterates once again the urgent need for truly independent investigations, conducted in a transparent and timely manner and resulting in shared, written reports that enable real accountability.

Despite the amount of media attention given to key urban battles such as the siege of Taiz and the battle for Hodeidah, the disaggregation of data on incidents of conflict and displacement by type of location shows that 68 per cent of the former and 69 per cent of the latter take place in rural areas. This is in line with the rural nature of the country\u2019s population.", "Rural to rural and urban to urban displacement are the dominant patterns of movement. The importance of having social networks in areas of displacement and transferable education and skills cannot be overemphasised. The war has also rendered typical pull factors to cities, such as access to basic services and livelihood opportunities, all but irrelevant, meaning that rural to urban displacement is not as common as it might otherwise have been.", "Despite the impacts of war, internally displaced people (IDPs) in urban areas still have better access to basic services than their rural counterparts.", "Access to water and electricity was poor in urban areas before the war, and even worse in rural areas. The war has only widened such gaps across sectors and the country as a whole. Rural inhabitants, including IDPs, are forced to travel long distances to access markets and health and education services, a costly and time-consuming endeavour that urban IDPs do not face. Understanding pre-war trends, particularly the decline of rural life and the spread of informal settlements on urban peripheries, will be key in developing solutions to displacement. Urban IDPs join the ranks of the broader urban poor, living in areas where water and electricity supplies and sanitation are all but absent. Deteriorating rural conditions led to rural to urban migration before the war, and this is certain to increase as the conflict aggravates rural decline and leaves IDPs from rural areas nowhere to return to. Developing tailored local solutions that include the integration of urban IDPs into the urban economy will help mitigate the impacts of displacement on individuals and the urban ecosystem as a whole.", "This paper examines the urban and rural characteristics of displacement in Yemen, including the push and pull factors in both areas.

It also draws on 40 interviews conducted with Yemeni refugees in Europe and Djibouti in May and June 2019, many of whom were also from Aden and Taiz. National and international service providers working in the two cities were interviewed for triangulation and clarification purposes.", "Yemen\u2019s war has caused economic opportunities in cities to shrink, basic services to break down and prices to soar, rendering many of the usual draws to urban areas irrelevant. Rural to urban displacement has not been a prevalent pattern of movement as a result. The traditionally rural nature of Yemeni society is a further significant factor", "Last-resort hosting sites also tend to be in rural areas, which potentially acts as a draw for the most vulnerable IDPs. Respondents interviewed for this study, however, placed great importance on the relevance of their education, skills and social networks in areas of displacement, these factors acting as the primary pull to new locations.", "Cities have played a key role in Yemen\u2019s conflict, and not only as theatres of war and power struggles from which hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced. Despite their limitations as a result of the conflict, they have also served as relatively safe havens for people displaced from both rural and other urban areas and have continued to provide better access to services for its residents.", "Given the country\u2019s pre-war urbanisation trends and the steady decline of rural life before the war, increasing rural to urban migration and displacement is inevitable. As Yemeni cities still offer better access to basic services and livelihood opportunities for skilled workers and professionals than rural areas, they will be pivotal to the country\u2019s recovery and future development.", "Given people\u2019s general preference for sustainable support, especially in the form of establishing or re-establishing livelihoods, despite the emergency context, there is a need to reconsider different types of approaches to assistance. Cities, in particular, provide an opportunity to pilot new approaches, in which urban IDPs, along with the urban poor living on the peripheries, are integrated into the cities\u2019 economies in a sustainable way so as to reduce the impacts of displacement on future urbanisation and development.", "http://www.internal-displacement.org/publications/yemen-urban-displacement-in-a-rural-society", "(** B H)", "For migrants, stopover in Yemen often means rape and torture", "\u201cWhat will they do to us?\u201d Zahra thought.", "This story is part of an occasional series, \u201cOutsourcing Migrants,\u201d produced with the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.", "She and 300 other Africans had just endured six hours crammed in a wooden smuggling boat to cross the narrow strait between the Red Sea and the gulf.

Rural inhabitants, including IDPs, are forced to travel long distances to access markets and health and education services, a costly and time-consuming endeavour that urban IDPs do not face. Understanding pre-war trends, particularly the decline of rural life and the spread of informal settlements on urban peripheries, will be key in developing solutions to displacement. Urban IDPs join the ranks of the broader urban poor, living in areas where water and electricity supplies and sanitation are all but absent. Deteriorating rural conditions led to rural to urban migration before the war, and this is certain to increase as the conflict aggravates rural decline and leaves IDPs from rural areas nowhere to return to.

Understanding pre-war trends, particularly the decline of rural life and the spread of informal settlements on urban peripheries, will be key in developing solutions to displacement. Urban IDPs join the ranks of the broader urban poor, living in areas where water and electricity supplies and sanitation are all but absent. Deteriorating rural conditions led to rural to urban migration before the war, and this is certain to increase as the conflict aggravates rural decline and leaves IDPs from rural areas nowhere to return to.

This advances the goal of institutionally restoring Yemen's regional identity that was peacefully erased following their 1990 unification and then militantly enforced after the North's victory in the brief civil war that erupted in 1994 in an attempt by the South to reverse this decision upon feeling as though their counterparts took advantage of them and their resources during the intervening four years. This outcome wouldn't have been made possible had it not been for the August events, so it should still be seen as a step forward for the overall cause.", "Without the UAE's full support (held back partially out of concern that it would make the emerging rift with Saudi Arabia irreconcilable and thus create a strategic opening for the Ansarullah), the STC was unable to liberate the rest of South Yemen, hence why it was compelled to compromise.

This therefore puts the country on the path towards what may be its inevitable federalization back into its constituent Northern and Southern halves as part of an eventual peace deal between all sides that could potentially be mediated by Moscow. It's difficult to think of any other realistic solution to the stalled campaign that's failed to dislodge the Ansarullah from the North despite causing the world's worst humanitarian crisis in pursuit thereof, though the devil is obviously in the details and much more work would have to be done in that respect before Saudi Arabia would ever agreeing to anything like that.

Understanding pre-war trends, particularly the decline of rural life and the spread of informal settlements on urban peripheries, will be key in developing solutions to displacement. Urban IDPs join the ranks of the broader urban poor, living in areas where water and electricity supplies and sanitation are all but absent. Deteriorating rural conditions led to rural to urban migration before the war, and this is certain to increase as the conflict aggravates rural decline and leaves IDPs from rural areas nowhere to return to.

This advances the goal of institutionally restoring Yemen's regional identity that was peacefully erased following their 1990 unification and then militantly enforced after the North's victory in the brief civil war that erupted in 1994 in an attempt by the South to reverse this decision upon feeling as though their counterparts took advantage of them and their resources during the intervening four years.

This therefore puts the country on the path towards what may be its inevitable federalization back into its constituent Northern and Southern halves as part of an eventual peace deal between all sides that could potentially be mediated by Moscow. It's difficult to think of any other realistic solution to the stalled campaign that's failed to dislodge the Ansarullah from the North despite causing the world's worst humanitarian crisis in pursuit thereof, though the devil is obviously in the details and much more work would have to be done in that respect before Saudi Arabia would ever agreeing to anything like that.
