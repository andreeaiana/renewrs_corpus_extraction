The aim was to show that in the Middle East, Sunni and Shiite affiliations matter in the relationship between the regional powers and respective proxies, as opposing to realist statement that alliances, conflicts and political developments are only governed by pragmatic power interests. Additionally, the work examines whether religious national identities have impact on the dynamics of proxy conflicts. Overall, the objective was to establish comprehensive image of how ideational/constructivist and pragmatic/realist factors work in combination to influence alliances, enmities and conflicts in the Middle East. Using qualitative methods of research, religious (national) identities of Saudi Arabia, Iran and their allies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen were constructed so as to create ideational and realist points of departure, and then interlinked to show how convergence of religious identities helps in creating durable alliances if used in targeted manner as a strategic tool which can help safeguard national interests. The work shows notable differences in the use of this tool between Saudi Arabia and Iran, suggesting that it may influence foreign policy successes and failures. Additionally, support of religious convergence between Saudi Arabia, Iran and their respective proxies has direct impact on the dynamic of conflicts and political developments, as \"sectarianization\" affects formerly secular causes.", "3 .3 Yemen", "3.3.1 Iran and Houthi rebels", "All in all, since the beginning of the Houthi\u2013Yemeni government conflict around 2012, we can observe intensification of sectarian hatred in the places and contexts where it was not originally present. However, unlike Lebanon and Syria, Yemen seems to be for Iran a small backyard battlefield that only serves the purpose of keeping Riyadh distracted militarily, politically and economically. Such Iranian strategy is reflected in dynamic of the conflict \u2013 support is just enough to keep the conflict going, yet the profound religious convergence seems to be lacking, which is indicative of the fact that for Iran, Yemen is not a place of strategic interest. In other words, Iranians are not trying to forge deeper ties with Houthis that would be based on common Shiite identity and mutual affinity, which could suggest plans for long-term engagement. Thus, the effort to reach religious convergence \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 can serve as a clue indicating significance of Iranian strategic interest in the given area. Iran does not have influence over Houthi decision-making; Houthis are deciding about the next course of action on their own, which sometimes results into half-baked and reckless decisions. Apparently, Iranians are not willing to sink in the Yemeni quagmire like Saudis did. Direct vicinity of Yemen to SA makes it Saudi strategic interest, which implies any serious Iranian attempts to attack SA via Yemen could be extremely dangerous, as Riyadh would not tolerate Iranian influence on the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, Iran understands Houthi victory is not the goal, since presence inYemen is not considered Iranian strategic interest, but rather just a way to trouble Saudis.", "3.3.2 Saudi Arabia, Yemeni government and Yemeni Salafists", "To conclude, Saudi Arabia is in the case of war in Yemen trying to reinforce convergence of religious identity with Salafi and Islamist factions and corresponding segments of population, so as to secureSaudi influence in territory deemed strategically important. This is being done through financing of various religious establishments, charities and humanitarian organizations. Saudi humanitarian aid is often delivered with a religious message \u2013 the purpose of such action is to reinforce the aspect of help to \u201cSunni brothers\u201d inYemen. However, the problem with export of Saudi religious identity to Yemen is twofold: first, support of radical Salafi groups can negatively interfere into any future political arrangement because with financial and military backing their real power increases and they may demand substantial share of political power without the need to compromise with other parties of the conflict. Second, there is no targeted strategy and little oversight \u2013 just like in Syria, it seems like Salafi militias and the affiliated tribes that commit to fighting the Houthis are given money, arms and supplies without requirement for assurances. This leads to ineffectiveness, infighting and risk of weapons ending up with radical Jihadi strands or AQAP that could threaten SA once again in the future.

Since the Iranian revolution in 1979, the two states have become embroiled in an increasingly vitriolic rivalry that is shaped by geopolitical aspirations but given existential importance by claims to Islamic legitimacy, with repercussions felt across Muslim communities worldwide.", "As the rivalry took on a sectarian dimension it began to play out in divided societies such as those covered in this report, where domestic politics took place within the context of broader geopolitical events. The presence of allies and proxies across the region, often along sect-based lines, provided Riyadh and Tehran with the means of shaping political life and countering the influence of their rival.", "Regimes across the region have used sectarian language as a means of maintaining power, entrenching divisions within society.

The Houthi movement is often called as \u2018Twelver Shiites\u2019, \u2018the new Hizballah of the Arabian Peninsula\u2019 or an \u2018Iranian puppet\u2019.

Yet, local actors involved in the conflict have an interest in borrowing sectarian narratives to mobilize international support and resources by situating their struggle in the regional meta-narrative. President Hadi has adopted an anti-Shiite narrative in his confrontation with the Houthis to maintain the support from Gulf countries, who perceive the Iranian expansion in the region as the most dangerous threat. The Houthis would like more support from Iran by adopting slurs from the \u2018\u2019Twelver Shiite\u2019\u2019 vocabulary and using famous historical symbols,such as the name of Hussein. The Saudi Kingdom is also interested in providing legitimacy for its military operation, especially at home, and sectarianism provides a wide support for the operation. In short, sectarianism in Yemen remains alien to the local culture but has grown as a strategic war narrative used by local and international actors.", "Although Yemen lacks the sharp sectarian divides found in Iraq, Bahrain, and Syria, the sectarianisation of the political transition in Yemen generates distinct junctures, which are likely to have long-lasting implications onYemen and the region.
