So the attempt to use a rocket to attack a KSA Air Force base from which military aircraft fly for bombings was the classic answer from the side of the Zaydis. It indirectly confirms that the Houthis really did have serious losses as a result of the Saudi airstrikes. In this, during the entire period preceding the truce and consultations in Geneva, the parties at war in Yemen tried to cause each other the maximum loss and to establish (or at least to keep) control over the main strategic zones of the country.

This had a serious constraining effect. Losses of coalition forces appeared very significant, and attempts to disperse them with small groups in the mountain district, while minimizing losses, led to losing the tempo of the attack and leveled the advantage of using heavy equipment.

So the attempt to use a rocket to attack a KSA Air Force base from which military aircraft fly for bombings was the classic answer from the side of the Zaydis. It indirectly confirms that the Houthis really did have serious losses as a result of the Saudi airstrikes. In this, during the entire period preceding the truce and consultations in Geneva, the parties at war in Yemen tried to cause each other the maximum loss and to establish (or at least to keep) control over the main strategic zones of the country.

That tenet dictates that nations not only have a just cause for going to war but also resort to military force only after all other options have been exhausted. Despite Saudi claims to the contrary, the intervention is clearly not a case of self-defense. The notion that Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East (kept afloat primarily by Saudi funds), represents a military threat to Saudi Arabia is absurd. And to argue Saudi bombs are justified to prevent future terrorist attacks is to argue for preventive war, which violates just war theory and the UN Charter.", "The Saudis insist that their actions are legal because the legitimate Yemeni government invited military intervention. But the Hadi government hardly deserves the label legitimate. Hadi was elevated to the presidency after serving in Saleh's autocratic regime as vice president. Once president, Hadi used his position to consolidate power against the Houthis and Saleh loyalists all whilemisappropriating billions of dollars. A better description would be to call the Hadi government a tool of Saudi Arabia, since Saudi Arabia not only brokered the deal that allowed him to replace Saleh but also enabled him to return to Yemen after the Houthis drove him from the country.

So the attempt to use a rocket to attack a KSA Air Force base from which military aircraft fly for bombings was the classic answer from the side of the Zaydis. It indirectly confirms that the Houthis really did have serious losses as a result of the Saudi airstrikes. In this, during the entire period preceding the truce and consultations in Geneva, the parties at war in Yemen tried to cause each other the maximum loss and to establish (or at least to keep) control over the main strategic zones of the country.

Losses of coalition forces appeared very significant, and attempts to disperse them with small groups in the mountain district, while minimizing losses, led to losing the tempo of the attack and leveled the advantage of using heavy equipment.
