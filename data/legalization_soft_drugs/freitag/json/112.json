The devastating civil war is playing out in one of the most internally complex nations in the Middle East, Yemen's intricate mix of tribes, religious sects and decades-deep power struggles driving a conflict intensified by the outside intervention of regional rivals. The Saudi-led air military coalition, \"Operation Decisive Storm,\" has introduced some 100 warplanes and 100 thousand troops into the already volatile mix, with Egypt, Morroco, Jordan, Sudan, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and now even Colombia making war in one of the poorest, yet most culturally rich, countries in the region as they combat the Houthi movement, which has received some degree of support from Iran. Airstrikes have killed more than 1,100 people, the majority civlians, and devastated Yemen's already tenuous infrastucture, while at least one in four Yemenis was in need of humanitarian assistance even before Cyclone Chapala slammed Yemen's southern coast on November 4, adding thousands of fleeing coastal residents to the already nearly 1.5 million Yemenis internally displaced by the war.", "Yet, for all the outside intervention, this is not a proxy war, according to leading Yemeni scholar and conflict specialist Nadwa Al-Dawsari. The founder of Partners Yemen, the local affiliate center of Partners for Democratic Change International, Al-Dawsari's work has taken her deep into Yemen's tribal areas. Warscapes turns to her to better understand the deeper forces driving the seemingly hopeless conflict.", "Michael Bronner: Thanks again for doing this. Can you tell me a little bit about your area of expertise as we get started?", "Nadwa Dawsari: My main expertise is in the area of conflict and local security, mainly in tribal areas in Yemen. I have worked extensively with civil society and created a civil society organization in 2009. I have done research and field assessments on areas related to local security and justice, both formal and informal, and the relationships between the formal and informal justice and security mechanisms. I\u2019ve written articles and reports on tribes, tribal conflicts, security and justice, al-Qaeda, tribes and al-Qaeda, tribes and the Houthis, political issues in Yemen. My work on the ground involves spending a lot of time building relationships with locals.", "MB: And, of course, you\u2019re Yemeni. Which part of the country are you from?", "ND: I\u2019m from Taiz.", "MB: One of the most important cities in Yemen\u2026", "ND: Yes, it is. Taiz is important for different reasons. First, it\u2019s the highest-populated area in the country. Taiz is in the middle between former North Yemen and former South Yemen, so geographically, it has a very strategic location. But also, Taiz is very important in the political transition context, because Taizis are the ones who spearheaded the 2011 uprising that led to removing former president Ali Abdullah Saleh from power. It\u2019s also the area where people are the most educated in the country.", "MB: Things are pretty bad there now.", "ND: Yeah, it\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s just beyond brutal for Taizis \u2013 what they have to go through: the tight siege and the fact that medicine, and even water and food supplies, are not allowed into the city. Civilians are being bombed almost constantly on a daily basis and many children and women have been killed. There is a severe shortage of health and other key services. The situation deteriorates every day.", "MB: You\u2019ve come to the US only recently?", "ND: I grew up in the suburbs of Taiz, in the countryside. I did my Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature in Sanaa, and lived and worked in Sanaa until mid-2012, when I moved to the States.", "MB: Your expertise is Yemen\u2019s tribes \u2013 the country\u2019s tribal structure. You always hear, in the most basic descriptions of Yemen, that it\u2019s a \u201ctribal society.\u201d What does that really mean in the Yemeni context?", "ND: Some 70 percent of the population lives in rural areas, and most of these are tribal areas. The state and the government have very little presence, if any. So, in the Yemeni context, strong tribes mean that a mechanism exists that has, in the absence of the state, provided local people with key services, particularly related to justice and security. People tend to cherish their tribal identity and be proud of it, especially in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country. That\u2019s because the tribes provide them with protection, with the sense of community and support. That doesn\u2019t mean that local people in tribal areas don\u2019t have aspirations to see functioning state institutions. It is actually the opposite, according to my research. The tribal system has grown weaker over the past decades, and it\u2019s become much less effective than it used to be in terms of its ability to address conflicts, which led to more conflicts and more security problems. That is why tribal people have a strong desire to see courts and a security presence established in their areas.", "MB: Just to step back, when were the prospects best for Yemen? When did things really work smoothly? You can go back as far as you want.", "ND: Well, let me talk about modern Yemen. (In the old times, of course, you\u2019re talking about the Queen of Sheba, and then Queen Arwa \u2013 but that\u2019s a long time ago!) In the modern history, I think Yemen was relatively stable and better off during the \u201880s, when oil was just discovered and there was a large Yemeni diaspora in the Gulf countries, particularly in Saudi Arabia \u2013 Yemenis who were sending money back home. So the economy was blooming back in the \u201880s, and I think those were, relatively speaking, the happiest days of modern Yemen.", "MB: The US became heavily involved with Yemen after 9/11, but through a very narrow focus on counterterrorism. What effect did that have on the fabric of government and the fabric of the tribal society?", "ND: Yes, the US has focused mainly on security and counterterrorism. That\u2019s why the US was supportive of Ali Abdullah Saleh, a dictator who abused his power and who was extremely corrupt. He was manipulating al-Qaeda all along and was using the militant group for political gain, which has been confirmed in recent reports. US assistance to Saleh helped him solidify his regime and strengthen his and his family\u2019s grip over power and resources. A lot of the military aid that US provided went to army and security units that were led by his son and nephews. This undermined governance and contributed to corruption, both were and have been strong causes of conflict in the country, including tribal areas, and a factor in the cause of the current war.", "MB: I spent time in Yemen in early 2002, shortly after 9/11, when the US was exerting tremendous pressure on Saleh to conform to US counterterrorism policies. The American Ambassador, who was a counterterrorism figure at the State Department before he became ambassador, told me at the time that there were basically maybe six people in the whole country \u2013 six people tied to al-Qaeda \u2013 that they were very worried about. Just six! But since that time, during the period of cooperation with Saleh, there have been literally hundreds of drone strikes and al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula has become a force. How do you account for this sense now that Yemen is full of al-Qaeda?", "ND: The assumption has always been that a strong central government is crucial to counterterrorism, which is quite misleading in the context of Yemen, where the central government is pretty corrupt. In other words, the problem was not in the fact that the central government was weak. The problem was in the fact that the government was too centralized and too corrupt. What Yemen needed was strong local security. Yemen needed local police. Yemen needed local institutions that are accountable and transparent, that can provide services to the people. Because local institutions were underdeveloped and often hijacked by the central government, corruption prevailed and grievances increased. It\u2019s because of corruption that unemployment and poverty increased, and people grew very frustrated with the government. A lot of these young people who have no jobs have fought: Some of them joined al-Qaeda and other armed groups, not because they believe in the ideology, but because they\u2019re too frustrated with the government. The same thing was true, for example, in the South, when the government fought al-Qaeda in early 2014. Some members of the Southern Movement [who support a dissolution of the single state into the pre-1990 South and North Yemen] fought with al-Qaeda. These are secular people. But they fought with al-Qaeda because they\u2019re fighting a common enemy, which is a Yemeni government that they see as illegitimate.", "MB: If you\u2019re thinking about the war right now, we\u2019re seeing horrible images not only from Taiz, but also from Sanaa, the capital. Are these representations emblematic of the situation across the country \u2013 is it all in turmoil \u2013 or does it vary?", "ND: The country is in turmoil, but certain areas are definitely worse than others. They\u2019re all bad, but Taiz definitely the most affected. You also have areas like Sa\u2019ada which has been severely bombed by airstrikes. The South is a time bomb. The security situation in the South is very alarming and continues to deteriorate everyday. You hear reports about the spread of al-Qaeda and other extremist elements. There are different southern factions that are deeply divided and now armed. The governor of Shebwa [governorate], in an interview last week, said al-Qaeda is planning to take over Shebwa and Abyan. If that happens, two major governorates will be under the control of al-Qaeda. The government is absent in the South, and at the same time there is an unprecedented influx of arms that are falling into the hands of al-Qaeda, tribes and local groups. This is a recipe for prolonged and widespread conflict.", "MB: If you were to trace the deeper roots of the war that\u2019s raging now, how far back would you go?", "ND: The root cause of this war is the fact that the Northern elite have always had a monopoly over resources and power while the rest of the country is marginalized. This was the case for the thousand years during which the Zaydi Imams ruled the country, and continued after they were toppled in 1962. When Saleh came to power, the Northern elite continued to control power and resources. It was Saleh\u2019s family; Saleh\u2019s extended tribe, Sanhan; his allies from the powerful tribal Ahmar family; and his patronage network of tribal and religious leaders and other influential figures across the country. What we have seen over the past two decades, and in particular since 2011, is the manifestation of a power struggle among these Northern elite alliance players who have since become enemies because of competition over who controls reseources in Yemen. Now, add the Houthis, who are an extension of the Zaydi Hashimites that have morphed into a rebel group. So the root cause is essentially the chronic power struggle among the Northern political elites coupled with the systematic marginalization of the rest of the country.", "MB: But there are a lot of outside forces at play as well, obviously.", "ND: Yes, that\u2019s true. The Saudis are involved, and now the Iranians are involved too. The Qataris are involved. The Emiratis are involved. All these outside forces have backed up different parties of the conflict, but the conflict is Yemeni. The Houthis are not fighting with Hadi [Yemen\u2019s president] because Iran asked them to fight Hadi. The same holds true with forces fighting the Houthis and Saleh: They\u2019re not fighting because the Saudis gave them money to fight. The struggle is Yemeni versus Yemeni. The conflict is Yemeni versus Yemeni. Outside forces are only contributing to the conflict, and are making it worse.", "MB: Can we just go through some of the players? In the most basic terms, tell me what they want in this war, starting with the Houthis.", "ND: The Houthis emerged back in the early \u201890s, and they weren\u2019t named Houthis back then. They were a newly-formed cultural movement called the Believing Youth. The purpose of the movement was to revive the Zaydi tradition in Sa\u2019ada, which was made in response to the strong presence of an extreme Salafi institute in Sa\u2019ada, the Dar al-Hadith Center, which was preaching anti-Zaidism [Zaidism is an early sect of Shi\u2019a Islam \u2013 comprising some 35-40 percent of Yemen\u2019s Muslim population \u2013 that emerged in the 8th century]. But then the movement grew and it changed in nature. Hussein Bader Al-Deen Al-Houthi, who was one of sons of the founders of the Believing Youth, turned it into a rebel movement in the early 2000s. They fought six wars with the government between 2004 and 2010. The Houthis took part in the 2011 uprising and they took part in the National Dialogue Conference. But then they allied with former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and they staged a coup in September 2014.", "MB: Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, who was Saleh\u2019s vice president, was essentially Saleh\u2019s hand-picked successor. What happened, and how did it help precipitate the war?", "ND: I think Saleh was okay with Hadi taking his place because Hadi was Saleh\u2019s man for sixteen years. And so, Saleh thought that he could still rule Yemen through Hadi. But then, Hadi broke away from Saleh\u2019s control.", "MB: In terms of Hadi\u2019s anti-corruption measures \u2013 things like that?", "ND: When Hadi started removing Saleh\u2019s relatives from key positions \u2013 including Saleh\u2019s son, nephew and brother \u2013 it became clear to Saleh that Hadi is no longer \u201cunder the influence\u201d of Saleh\u2019s control. Saleh then started mobilizing against Hadi and the government, allying with Houthis and supporting them militarily and financially, which helped them sweep through Amran and eventually take the capital city, Sanaa, by force.", "MB: Another key player is Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, the former general and business tycoon\u2026", "ND: Ali Mohsen was Saleh\u2019s confidant and companion for 30-something years. They were partners. Saleh could not have done what he did \u2013 meaning establishing himself in power \u2013 without Ali Mohsen\u2019s support. He was his right hand man. The two were on good terms until the early 2000s, when Saleh established the Republican Guard and made his son the commander. And so, it became clear to Ali Mohsen, and to the al-Ahmar family, Saleh\u2019s key allies since he came to power \u2013 that Saleh was preparing his son to become the next president. An official or a written agreement between the three \u2013 Ali Abdullah Saleh, Ali Mohsen and the al-Ahmar family \u2013 was that they would rule together and agree on arrangements on how to do that. But then, when Saleh started preparing his son to become the next president, that\u2019s where the relationship went sour between Ali Mohsen, Ali Saleh and the al-Ahmars and that is when power struggle started.", "MB: How, from this internal power struggle, did the Saudis come to begin the current bombing campaign in Yemen?", "ND: The Saudis have had heavy influence in Yemen since the \u201870s. Saleh was a Saudi puppet, as was his regime. That includes Ali Mohsen and al-Ahmars. The Saudis have always feared Yemen. In particular, they\u2019ve always feared that any development or progress in Yemen towards democracy would incite calls for political reforms in their country. Through supporting Saleh and his regime, the Saudis helped maintain corruption and limit the chances for a genuine democracy to take place. When the Houthis suddenly emerged as a political and military force, the Saudis felt threatened because the Houthis were close to their regional rival, Iran. When Hadi\u2019s government failed to stop the Houthis and eventually collapsed, the Saudis decided to intervene to prevent an any potential Iranian control in its backyard, Yemen.", "MB: Would you say that, in the past, the Saudis\u2019 control had been fairly agile? They understand Yemen and the powers at play, and in the past, they\u2019ve controlled them fairly adeptly?", "ND: They did, but it was short-sighted because they thought that they could control Yemen forever despite the growing turmoil. Again, the Saudis \u2013 and it\u2019s the same thing with the US, and the international community more broadly \u2013 always look at national actors. The Saudis thought that they could perpetually control Yemen through the Saleh regime, and they did for a while. But that didn\u2019t last because the regime itself started losing control. Widespread corruption and systematic marginalization fueled local grievances over the years leading to the 2011 uprising that pushed Saleh out of power. Then comes the GCC sponsored UN-US-backed transition deal, which had major flaws. It sort of recycled Saleh\u2019s regime while granting him immunity, and no substantial political reforms happened because of that. Tension continues to build up, and if you look at Yemen today, you will see that many local forces have taken up arms and fought as they\u2019ve grown tired of national actors and the Northern elite\u2019s hegemony. Those cannot be \u201ctamed\u201d with another deal that maintains national actors, be it the Houthis or Saleh\u2019s allies, or even Hadi and his government. No one can control all of Yemen anymore.", "MB: Would you say the same is true for the US and its short involvement in Yemen \u2013 that the US misunderstood the flows of power?", "ND: Yes, definitely. The US government and the international community have always looked at Yemen through the lens of Sanaa and the lens of national actors. First it was the Saleh government, then Hadi. The US and the international community continued to overlook the local dynamics and local conflicts that are increasingly shaping the conflict and are the key to the solution.", "MB: If you consider the current bombing \u2013 the Saudi air strikes, which have wrought such havoc, and also US drone strikes, which are ongoing \u2013 it\u2019s hard to figure out what the purpose is. It doesn\u2019t seem like there's very much to bomb that might resolve anything in Yemen.", "ND: That is true. The country\u2019s infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, bridges, you name it, has been destroyed. Thousands of civilians have been killed. It didn\u2019t change much except that the situation worsened and continues to deteriorate.", "MB: Insofar as the US is currently supporting the Saudis and the coalition, how is the US role perceived right now?", "ND: Among the Houthis and their supporters, and those who are most affected by the air strikes, there is resentment. Last month, the US signed a $ 1 billion dollar arms agreement with the Saudi government. A proposal by the Netherlands to set up a committee to investigate into war crimes in Yemen was dropped because it didn\u2019t have sufficient backing from key countries including the US. It gives the impression that the US is complicit in supporting war crimes committed by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. On the other hand, the US government was reluctant at the beginning to condemn the Houthi/Saleh take-over of the capital by force. In October last year, US drone strikes in Radaa targeted AlQaeda but also tribesmen who were fighting Houthis. This actually helped the Houthis control the town and surrounding areas. It created resentment towards t he US among local tribes that resisted the Houthis advance into their areas. As a result, there is a strong perception that the US is also in bed with Iran and hence Houthis.MB: To what extent would you credit, among the myriad of dynamics at play, the Saudi-Iranian animosity and a sense of proxy war?", "ND: I don\u2019t think Iran is dictating what the Houthis are doing, but Iran has certainly supported the Houthis a lot. Many Houthis \u2013 hundreds, if not thousands \u2013 were trained by Hezbollah in Lebanon, and trained in Iran as well. You can trace the influence of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard training in the way Houthis conduct their operations and how they go after their opponents, as well as in the way their security apparatus is functioning. When the Houthis took over before the Saudi\u2019s intervened, a Houthi delegation visited Iran and signed a deal with the Iranian government that includes operating fourteen flights per week between Sanaa and Tehran. They\u2019ve reinforced the Saudis\u2019 fears, valid or not, that Iran is utilizing the Houthis to disrupt Saudi Arabia. The Saudis also supported local actors to fight Houthis. The Houthis are not fighting on behalf of Iran, and local actors are not fighting on behalf of Saudi Arabia. Anti-Houthi local actors are using Saudi money and support to push the Houthis out of their regions. Same thing with the Houthis; they\u2019re using Iran\u2019s support to extend their power to as large an area as possible in the country.", "MB: Is it possible for anyone to win the war at this point?", "ND: I don\u2019t think so. The political process seems to be hitting a dead end. There are no signs of good will to enter into political negotiations whatsoever from wither side. The Houthis have increased their offensive in Taiz and Mareb. In Taiz, they\u2019ve been enforcing a tight siege, preventing medicine, food and even water from entering the city. They\u2019ve been bombing the city every day, killing dozens of civilians. At the same time, the airstrikes intensified especially in the areas under Houthi control in the North, and many civilians were killed because of that. It seems that the Houthis, and the Saudis, are more interested in resolving this militarily. But when you look at the military operations, you see that for the past months, it\u2019s been more or less a stalemate. The Houthis advance, and then pro-Hadi government and local forces push them out, and then the Houthis advance again and so on and so forth. It\u2019s been pretty much stagnant. I think it\u2019s going to be a long war, unless somehow, miraculously, conflict sides agree to negotiations in good faith.", "MB: Just to go back to the protests in 2011, which is the most immediate spark to the current conflict, there\u2019s tendency to lump all of the different Arab countries\u2019 uprisings under the vague category of Arab Spring. In Yemen, what were the particular dynamics at play, and how do these fit in the path towards war?", "ND: In 2011, yes, the protesters were inspired by what happened in Tunisia and Egypt. But then, Yemenis have been protesting since the early 2000s against the government. Yemeni activists were protesting in front of the cabinet and in front of the Presidential Palace against corruption, injustice and human rights abuses. Yemen\u2019s uprising was driven by 20 years of political marginalization and unaddressed local grievances. But, like other Arab Spring countries, the uprising in Yemen was about ending the control by a small political elite over power and wealth; it was about revolting against marginalization, corruption, injustice and human rights abuses. It was about the desire to end tyranny.", "MB: The period that you just described \u2013 the early 2000s into 2011 \u2013 is the exact same period that the US has partnered with Saleh and counter terrorism\u2026", "ND: Yes. The US government has turned a blind eye to Saleh\u2019s human rights abuses and his corruption, simply because he was an ally in the war on terror.", "MB: Is it fair to say that the resources his government received from the US enabled him to enrich his family?", "ND: I think it is fair to say that. Saleh used the counter terrorism assistance to strengthen his and his family\u2019s grip over power. His son was the head of the Special Forces and nephew was the head of Central Security Forces, the two armed units that received extensive training and support from the US as part of the CT partnership. After a decade of support, Saleh\u2019s family\u2019s grip on power became stronger, and in reaction, Yemen\u2019s al-Qaeda faction did too.", "MB: The Houthis, who have fought six wars with Saleh\u2019s government, are now allied with Saleh (now that he\u2019s out of power). What is the timetable for this about-face?", "ND: It\u2019s hard to track in definite terms, but we could see patterns beginning in 2011 when the Houthis started fighting with the tribes in Al Jawf and Marib. It was clear that the Houthis had access to arms \u2013 heavy arms \u2013 that they wouldn\u2019t have access to unless somebody gave it to them, and that was Saleh. Their dramatic expansion across Yemen in 2014 was also facilitated by tribal leaders who are loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh.", "MB: To what do you describe the growth of ISIS? Similar to what Al-Qaeda experienced in the early 2000s?", "ND: In my opinion, it is hard to confirm the presence of ISIS in Yemen. Are there individuals who are sympathetic with ISIS? Probably yes. But does ISIS exist as a group? I don\u2019t think that there is enough evidence to confirm that yet. ISIS does not have any documented presence in Yemen. With Al-Qaeda, we know who they are. We know the names of their leaders .We know which tribes they come from and which ones they interact with. We know which areas they control. With ISIS, there\u2019s none of that. They clearly don\u2019t control any areas. Tweets, videos and photos of masked men with pick-up trucks, guns and black flags cannot be assumed to be evidence of an ISIS existence. ISIS could be part of the propaganda, or it could comprise an attempt by some local armed groups, extremist or otherwise, to brand themselves. Having said that, it is a problem by itself and debating whether it is ISIS or not is not as relevant as is the need to bring functioning government institutions to the entire country and establish security to prevent further deterioration.", "MB: But al-Qaeda has grown as a result of the conflict. What\u2019s the main reason for that?", "ND: Let\u2019s take the South, for example. During the fighting since March, police stations have closed down. Security forces withdrew from most governorates. The courts closed. Most of the South remained with no functioning police and security forces, no functioning courts, no functioning government. Al-Qaeda can come into any city when there is no government in place that can stop them. There has also been an influx of weapons and heavy arms everywhere because of the looting of army bases over the past few years. Local governments don\u2019t have the capacity to stand up to al-Qaeda. Same thing with the tribes. Let\u2019s take Al Bayda, where the tribes in the past have successfully limited al-Qaeda\u2019s presence and activities. In 2014, when these tribes were pushed to fight the Houthis, they joined hands with al-Qaeda. They\u2019re not trying to limit al-Qaeda\u2019s presence anymore, because they want help in pushing the Houthis out of their areas. The government collapsed and violent conflicts spread in many parts of the country. This chaos offers the perfect environment for al-Qaeda to recruit and operate. But, the failure of the transition government to bring in most needed governance and security reforms also was also a major contributor to the conflict and, as a result, the spread of AlQaeda.", "MB: Thanks very much for doing this.", "ND: Thank you. \u2013 by Nadwa Al-Dawsari and Michael Bronner", "Michael Bronner is Editor-at-large for Warscapes magazine. Nadwa Al-Dawsari is a conflict specialist and civil society leader, originating from Yemen", "http://www.warscapes.com/conversations/proxies-aside-closer-look-war-yemen", "Comment: Very interesting analysis of the situation in Yemen and the background of the war. I want to thank Michael Bronner for the permission to use this article.", "One critical point has to be added: Nadwa Al-Dawsari mentioned that hundreds or even thousands of Houthi fighters would have been trained by Hizbollah in Libanon. Where does she know this from? When this should have happened? Are there any sources she has for that? There must be great doubts at that. Who has seen them in Libanon? It hardly could have been possible to overlook them. And: How should they have got there and back? Hard to imagine. By land: The only way is leading through Saudi Arabia. How they should have managed this by the thousands, even by the hundreds? Saudi Arabia blocked its southern frontier to Yemen even before the war. By sea?

It was the very unpopular Hadi who reneged on the deal and fled first to Aden and then to Riyadh and asked Saudi to start bombing his own country and people. Secondly the issue of the siege. All Yemen is under blockade and some stuff is getting into Taiz reported by aid organisations, in the background of the speaker you see cars, people and children walking around and not looking like skeletons. Some areas like Saada have a worse humanitarian situation. Thirdly all militias and fighting forces are killing people in Taiz; it is the most brutal part of a terrible, terrible war. I do have sympathy with Taiz - in effect they don't have sympathy with either the old South Yemen or the rest of the North, so they are isolated in their suffering; North and South deride them and deny what they are going through. They also are not supported by UAE as the majority of their fighters are Islah and that is seen as a terrorist organisation by UAE. And of course, the people in Taiz itself are split - many fighting with the Houthi-Saleh alliance against what they see as the invasion by a foreign force. The Islah supporters are the most polarised in Yemen and see only a military victory as a possible outcome; they have long animosity against Saleh for historical reasons. And the southerners remember the Islah militias from Taiz in the 1994 war who so brutally suppressed their hopes of an independent South and hence their animosity. These supporters of Islah don't acknowledge the sufferings of the rest of Yemen, and they don't ever acknowledge the deaths from the Saudi led coalition in Taiz though there is heavy aerial bombardment there. If they did it would be easier somehow to get Yemenis to unite for peace. As it is, many in the rest of Yemen say that there is no problem in Taiz and they cry crocodile tears.

First, it\u2019s the highest-populated area in the country. Taiz is in the middle between former North Yemen and former South Yemen, so geographically, it has a very strategic location. But also, Taiz is very important in the political transition context, because Taizis are the ones who spearheaded the 2011 uprising that led to removing former president Ali Abdullah Saleh from power. It\u2019s also the area where people are the most educated in the country.", "MB: Things are pretty bad there now.", "ND: Yeah, it\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s just beyond brutal for Taizis \u2013 what they have to go through: the tight siege and the fact that medicine, and even water and food supplies, are not allowed into the city. Civilians are being bombed almost constantly on a daily basis and many children and women have been killed. There is a severe shortage of health and other key services. The situation deteriorates every day.", "MB: You\u2019ve come to the US only recently?", "ND: I grew up in the suburbs of Taiz, in the countryside. I did my Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature in Sanaa, and lived and worked in Sanaa until mid-2012, when I moved to the States.", "MB: Your expertise is Yemen\u2019s tribes \u2013 the country\u2019s tribal structure. You always hear, in the most basic descriptions of Yemen, that it\u2019s a \u201ctribal society.\u201d What does that really mean in the Yemeni context?", "ND: Some 70 percent of the population lives in rural areas, and most of these are tribal areas. The state and the government have very little presence, if any. So, in the Yemeni context, strong tribes mean that a mechanism exists that has, in the absence of the state, provided local people with key services, particularly related to justice and security. People tend to cherish their tribal identity and be proud of it, especially in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country. That\u2019s because the tribes provide them with protection, with the sense of community and support. That doesn\u2019t mean that local people in tribal areas don\u2019t have aspirations to see functioning state institutions. It is actually the opposite, according to my research. The tribal system has grown weaker over the past decades, and it\u2019s become much less effective than it used to be in terms of its ability to address conflicts, which led to more conflicts and more security problems. That is why tribal people have a strong desire to see courts and a security presence established in their areas.", "MB: Just to step back, when were the prospects best for Yemen? When did things really work smoothly? You can go back as far as you want.", "ND: Well, let me talk about modern Yemen. (In the old times, of course, you\u2019re talking about the Queen of Sheba, and then Queen Arwa \u2013 but that\u2019s a long time ago!) In the modern history, I think Yemen was relatively stable and better off during the \u201880s, when oil was just discovered and there was a large Yemeni diaspora in the Gulf countries, particularly in Saudi Arabia \u2013 Yemenis who were sending money back home. So the economy was blooming back in the \u201880s, and I think those were, relatively speaking, the happiest days of modern Yemen.", "MB: The US became heavily involved with Yemen after 9/11, but through a very narrow focus on counterterrorism. What effect did that have on the fabric of government and the fabric of the tribal society?", "ND: Yes, the US has focused mainly on security and counterterrorism. That\u2019s why the US was supportive of Ali Abdullah Saleh, a dictator who abused his power and who was extremely corrupt. He was manipulating al-Qaeda all along and was using the militant group for political gain, which has been confirmed in recent reports. US assistance to Saleh helped him solidify his regime and strengthen his and his family\u2019s grip over power and resources. A lot of the military aid that US provided went to army and security units that were led by his son and nephews. This undermined governance and contributed to corruption, both were and have been strong causes of conflict in the country, including tribal areas, and a factor in the cause of the current war.", "MB: I spent time in Yemen in early 2002, shortly after 9/11, when the US was exerting tremendous pressure on Saleh to conform to US counterterrorism policies. The American Ambassador, who was a counterterrorism figure at the State Department before he became ambassador, told me at the time that there were basically maybe six people in the whole country \u2013 six people tied to al-Qaeda \u2013 that they were very worried about. Just six! But since that time, during the period of cooperation with Saleh, there have been literally hundreds of drone strikes and al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula has become a force. How do you account for this sense now that Yemen is full of al-Qaeda?", "ND: The assumption has always been that a strong central government is crucial to counterterrorism, which is quite misleading in the context of Yemen, where the central government is pretty corrupt. In other words, the problem was not in the fact that the central government was weak. The problem was in the fact that the government was too centralized and too corrupt. What Yemen needed was strong local security. Yemen needed local police. Yemen needed local institutions that are accountable and transparent, that can provide services to the people. Because local institutions were underdeveloped and often hijacked by the central government, corruption prevailed and grievances increased. It\u2019s because of corruption that unemployment and poverty increased, and people grew very frustrated with the government. A lot of these young people who have no jobs have fought: Some of them joined al-Qaeda and other armed groups, not because they believe in the ideology, but because they\u2019re too frustrated with the government. The same thing was true, for example, in the South, when the government fought al-Qaeda in early 2014. Some members of the Southern Movement [who support a dissolution of the single state into the pre-1990 South and North Yemen] fought with al-Qaeda. These are secular people. But they fought with al-Qaeda because they\u2019re fighting a common enemy, which is a Yemeni government that they see as illegitimate.", "MB: If you\u2019re thinking about the war right now, we\u2019re seeing horrible images not only from Taiz, but also from Sanaa, the capital. Are these representations emblematic of the situation across the country \u2013 is it all in turmoil \u2013 or does it vary?", "ND: The country is in turmoil, but certain areas are definitely worse than others. They\u2019re all bad, but Taiz definitely the most affected. You also have areas like Sa\u2019ada which has been severely bombed by airstrikes. The South is a time bomb. The security situation in the South is very alarming and continues to deteriorate everyday. You hear reports about the spread of al-Qaeda and other extremist elements. There are different southern factions that are deeply divided and now armed. The governor of Shebwa [governorate], in an interview last week, said al-Qaeda is planning to take over Shebwa and Abyan. If that happens, two major governorates will be under the control of al-Qaeda. The government is absent in the South, and at the same time there is an unprecedented influx of arms that are falling into the hands of al-Qaeda, tribes and local groups. This is a recipe for prolonged and widespread conflict.", "MB: If you were to trace the deeper roots of the war that\u2019s raging now, how far back would you go?", "ND: The root cause of this war is the fact that the Northern elite have always had a monopoly over resources and power while the rest of the country is marginalized. This was the case for the thousand years during which the Zaydi Imams ruled the country, and continued after they were toppled in 1962. When Saleh came to power, the Northern elite continued to control power and resources. It was Saleh\u2019s family; Saleh\u2019s extended tribe, Sanhan; his allies from the powerful tribal Ahmar family; and his patronage network of tribal and religious leaders and other influential figures across the country. What we have seen over the past two decades, and in particular since 2011, is the manifestation of a power struggle among these Northern elite alliance players who have since become enemies because of competition over who controls reseources in Yemen. Now, add the Houthis, who are an extension of the Zaydi Hashimites that have morphed into a rebel group. So the root cause is essentially the chronic power struggle among the Northern political elites coupled with the systematic marginalization of the rest of the country.", "MB: But there are a lot of outside forces at play as well, obviously.", "ND: Yes, that\u2019s true. The Saudis are involved, and now the Iranians are involved too. The Qataris are involved. The Emiratis are involved. All these outside forces have backed up different parties of the conflict, but the conflict is Yemeni. The Houthis are not fighting with Hadi [Yemen\u2019s president] because Iran asked them to fight Hadi. The same holds true with forces fighting the Houthis and Saleh: They\u2019re not fighting because the Saudis gave them money to fight. The struggle is Yemeni versus Yemeni. The conflict is Yemeni versus Yemeni. Outside forces are only contributing to the conflict, and are making it worse.", "MB: Can we just go through some of the players? In the most basic terms, tell me what they want in this war, starting with the Houthis.", "ND: The Houthis emerged back in the early \u201890s, and they weren\u2019t named Houthis back then. They were a newly-formed cultural movement called the Believing Youth. The purpose of the movement was to revive the Zaydi tradition in Sa\u2019ada, which was made in response to the strong presence of an extreme Salafi institute in Sa\u2019ada, the Dar al-Hadith Center, which was preaching anti-Zaidism [Zaidism is an early sect of Shi\u2019a Islam \u2013 comprising some 35-40 percent of Yemen\u2019s Muslim population \u2013 that emerged in the 8th century]. But then the movement grew and it changed in nature. Hussein Bader Al-Deen Al-Houthi, who was one of sons of the founders of the Believing Youth, turned it into a rebel movement in the early 2000s. They fought six wars with the government between 2004 and 2010. The Houthis took part in the 2011 uprising and they took part in the National Dialogue Conference. But then they allied with former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and they staged a coup in September 2014.", "MB: Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, who was Saleh\u2019s vice president, was essentially Saleh\u2019s hand-picked successor. What happened, and how did it help precipitate the war?", "ND: I think Saleh was okay with Hadi taking his place because Hadi was Saleh\u2019s man for sixteen years. And so, Saleh thought that he could still rule Yemen through Hadi. But then, Hadi broke away from Saleh\u2019s control.", "MB: In terms of Hadi\u2019s anti-corruption measures \u2013 things like that?", "ND: When Hadi started removing Saleh\u2019s relatives from key positions \u2013 including Saleh\u2019s son, nephew and brother \u2013 it became clear to Saleh that Hadi is no longer \u201cunder the influence\u201d of Saleh\u2019s control. Saleh then started mobilizing against Hadi and the government, allying with Houthis and supporting them militarily and financially, which helped them sweep through Amran and eventually take the capital city, Sanaa, by force.", "MB: Another key player is Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, the former general and business tycoon\u2026", "ND: Ali Mohsen was Saleh\u2019s confidant and companion for 30-something years. They were partners. Saleh could not have done what he did \u2013 meaning establishing himself in power \u2013 without Ali Mohsen\u2019s support. He was his right hand man. The two were on good terms until the early 2000s, when Saleh established the Republican Guard and made his son the commander. And so, it became clear to Ali Mohsen, and to the al-Ahmar family, Saleh\u2019s key allies since he came to power \u2013 that Saleh was preparing his son to become the next president. An official or a written agreement between the three \u2013 Ali Abdullah Saleh, Ali Mohsen and the al-Ahmar family \u2013 was that they would rule together and agree on arrangements on how to do that. But then, when Saleh started preparing his son to become the next president, that\u2019s where the relationship went sour between Ali Mohsen, Ali Saleh and the al-Ahmars and that is when power struggle started.", "MB: How, from this internal power struggle, did the Saudis come to begin the current bombing campaign in Yemen?", "ND: The Saudis have had heavy influence in Yemen since the \u201870s. Saleh was a Saudi puppet, as was his regime. That includes Ali Mohsen and al-Ahmars. The Saudis have always feared Yemen. In particular, they\u2019ve always feared that any development or progress in Yemen towards democracy would incite calls for political reforms in their country. Through supporting Saleh and his regime, the Saudis helped maintain corruption and limit the chances for a genuine democracy to take place. When the Houthis suddenly emerged as a political and military force, the Saudis felt threatened because the Houthis were close to their regional rival, Iran. When Hadi\u2019s government failed to stop the Houthis and eventually collapsed, the Saudis decided to intervene to prevent an any potential Iranian control in its backyard, Yemen.", "MB: Would you say that, in the past, the Saudis\u2019 control had been fairly agile? They understand Yemen and the powers at play, and in the past, they\u2019ve controlled them fairly adeptly?", "ND: They did, but it was short-sighted because they thought that they could control Yemen forever despite the growing turmoil. Again, the Saudis \u2013 and it\u2019s the same thing with the US, and the international community more broadly \u2013 always look at national actors. The Saudis thought that they could perpetually control Yemen through the Saleh regime, and they did for a while. But that didn\u2019t last because the regime itself started losing control. Widespread corruption and systematic marginalization fueled local grievances over the years leading to the 2011 uprising that pushed Saleh out of power. Then comes the GCC sponsored UN-US-backed transition deal, which had major flaws. It sort of recycled Saleh\u2019s regime while granting him immunity, and no substantial political reforms happened because of that. Tension continues to build up, and if you look at Yemen today, you will see that many local forces have taken up arms and fought as they\u2019ve grown tired of national actors and the Northern elite\u2019s hegemony. Those cannot be \u201ctamed\u201d with another deal that maintains national actors, be it the Houthis or Saleh\u2019s allies, or even Hadi and his government. No one can control all of Yemen anymore.", "MB: Would you say the same is true for the US and its short involvement in Yemen \u2013 that the US misunderstood the flows of power?", "ND: Yes, definitely. The US government and the international community have always looked at Yemen through the lens of Sanaa and the lens of national actors. First it was the Saleh government, then Hadi. The US and the international community continued to overlook the local dynamics and local conflicts that are increasingly shaping the conflict and are the key to the solution.", "MB: If you consider the current bombing \u2013 the Saudi air strikes, which have wrought such havoc, and also US drone strikes, which are ongoing \u2013 it\u2019s hard to figure out what the purpose is. It doesn\u2019t seem like there's very much to bomb that might resolve anything in Yemen.", "ND: That is true. The country\u2019s infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, bridges, you name it, has been destroyed. Thousands of civilians have been killed. It didn\u2019t change much except that the situation worsened and continues to deteriorate.", "MB: Insofar as the US is currently supporting the Saudis and the coalition, how is the US role perceived right now?", "ND: Among the Houthis and their supporters, and those who are most affected by the air strikes, there is resentment. Last month, the US signed a $ 1 billion dollar arms agreement with the Saudi government. A proposal by the Netherlands to set up a committee to investigate into war crimes in Yemen was dropped because it didn\u2019t have sufficient backing from key countries including the US. It gives the impression that the US is complicit in supporting war crimes committed by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. On the other hand, the US government was reluctant at the beginning to condemn the Houthi/Saleh take-over of the capital by force. In October last year, US drone strikes in Radaa targeted AlQaeda but also tribesmen who were fighting Houthis. This actually helped the Houthis control the town and surrounding areas. It created resentment towards t he US among local tribes that resisted the Houthis advance into their areas. As a result, there is a strong perception that the US is also in bed with Iran and hence Houthis.MB: To what extent would you credit, among the myriad of dynamics at play, the Saudi-Iranian animosity and a sense of proxy war?", "ND: I don\u2019t think Iran is dictating what the Houthis are doing, but Iran has certainly supported the Houthis a lot. Many Houthis \u2013 hundreds, if not thousands \u2013 were trained by Hezbollah in Lebanon, and trained in Iran as well. You can trace the influence of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard training in the way Houthis conduct their operations and how they go after their opponents, as well as in the way their security apparatus is functioning. When the Houthis took over before the Saudi\u2019s intervened, a Houthi delegation visited Iran and signed a deal with the Iranian government that includes operating fourteen flights per week between Sanaa and Tehran. They\u2019ve reinforced the Saudis\u2019 fears, valid or not, that Iran is utilizing the Houthis to disrupt Saudi Arabia. The Saudis also supported local actors to fight Houthis. The Houthis are not fighting on behalf of Iran, and local actors are not fighting on behalf of Saudi Arabia. Anti-Houthi local actors are using Saudi money and support to push the Houthis out of their regions. Same thing with the Houthis; they\u2019re using Iran\u2019s support to extend their power to as large an area as possible in the country.", "MB: Is it possible for anyone to win the war at this point?", "ND: I don\u2019t think so. The political process seems to be hitting a dead end. There are no signs of good will to enter into political negotiations whatsoever from wither side. The Houthis have increased their offensive in Taiz and Mareb. In Taiz, they\u2019ve been enforcing a tight siege, preventing medicine, food and even water from entering the city. They\u2019ve been bombing the city every day, killing dozens of civilians. At the same time, the airstrikes intensified especially in the areas under Houthi control in the North, and many civilians were killed because of that. It seems that the Houthis, and the Saudis, are more interested in resolving this militarily. But when you look at the military operations, you see that for the past months, it\u2019s been more or less a stalemate. The Houthis advance, and then pro-Hadi government and local forces push them out, and then the Houthis advance again and so on and so forth. It\u2019s been pretty much stagnant. I think it\u2019s going to be a long war, unless somehow, miraculously, conflict sides agree to negotiations in good faith.", "MB: Just to go back to the protests in 2011, which is the most immediate spark to the current conflict, there\u2019s tendency to lump all of the different Arab countries\u2019 uprisings under the vague category of Arab Spring. In Yemen, what were the particular dynamics at play, and how do these fit in the path towards war?", "ND: In 2011, yes, the protesters were inspired by what happened in Tunisia and Egypt. But then, Yemenis have been protesting since the early 2000s against the government. Yemeni activists were protesting in front of the cabinet and in front of the Presidential Palace against corruption, injustice and human rights abuses. Yemen\u2019s uprising was driven by 20 years of political marginalization and unaddressed local grievances. But, like other Arab Spring countries, the uprising in Yemen was about ending the control by a small political elite over power and wealth; it was about revolting against marginalization, corruption, injustice and human rights abuses. It was about the desire to end tyranny.", "MB: The period that you just described \u2013 the early 2000s into 2011 \u2013 is the exact same period that the US has partnered with Saleh and counter terrorism\u2026", "ND: Yes. The US government has turned a blind eye to Saleh\u2019s human rights abuses and his corruption, simply because he was an ally in the war on terror.", "MB: Is it fair to say that the resources his government received from the US enabled him to enrich his family?", "ND: I think it is fair to say that. Saleh used the counter terrorism assistance to strengthen his and his family\u2019s grip over power. His son was the head of the Special Forces and nephew was the head of Central Security Forces, the two armed units that received extensive training and support from the US as part of the CT partnership. After a decade of support, Saleh\u2019s family\u2019s grip on power became stronger, and in reaction, Yemen\u2019s al-Qaeda faction did too.", "MB: The Houthis, who have fought six wars with Saleh\u2019s government, are now allied with Saleh (now that he\u2019s out of power). What is the timetable for this about-face?", "ND: It\u2019s hard to track in definite terms, but we could see patterns beginning in 2011 when the Houthis started fighting with the tribes in Al Jawf and Marib. It was clear that the Houthis had access to arms \u2013 heavy arms \u2013 that they wouldn\u2019t have access to unless somebody gave it to them, and that was Saleh. Their dramatic expansion across Yemen in 2014 was also facilitated by tribal leaders who are loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh.", "MB: To what do you describe the growth of ISIS? Similar to what Al-Qaeda experienced in the early 2000s?", "ND: In my opinion, it is hard to confirm the presence of ISIS in Yemen. Are there individuals who are sympathetic with ISIS? Probably yes. But does ISIS exist as a group? I don\u2019t think that there is enough evidence to confirm that yet. ISIS does not have any documented presence in Yemen. With Al-Qaeda, we know who they are. We know the names of their leaders .We know which tribes they come from and which ones they interact with. We know which areas they control. With ISIS, there\u2019s none of that. They clearly don\u2019t control any areas. Tweets, videos and photos of masked men with pick-up trucks, guns and black flags cannot be assumed to be evidence of an ISIS existence. ISIS could be part of the propaganda, or it could comprise an attempt by some local armed groups, extremist or otherwise, to brand themselves. Having said that, it is a problem by itself and debating whether it is ISIS or not is not as relevant as is the need to bring functioning government institutions to the entire country and establish security to prevent further deterioration.", "MB: But al-Qaeda has grown as a result of the conflict. What\u2019s the main reason for that?", "ND: Let\u2019s take the South, for example. During the fighting since March, police stations have closed down. Security forces withdrew from most governorates. The courts closed. Most of the South remained with no functioning police and security forces, no functioning courts, no functioning government. Al-Qaeda can come into any city when there is no government in place that can stop them. There has also been an influx of weapons and heavy arms everywhere because of the looting of army bases over the past few years. Local governments don\u2019t have the capacity to stand up to al-Qaeda. Same thing with the tribes. Let\u2019s take Al Bayda, where the tribes in the past have successfully limited al-Qaeda\u2019s presence and activities. In 2014, when these tribes were pushed to fight the Houthis, they joined hands with al-Qaeda. They\u2019re not trying to limit al-Qaeda\u2019s presence anymore, because they want help in pushing the Houthis out of their areas. The government collapsed and violent conflicts spread in many parts of the country. This chaos offers the perfect environment for al-Qaeda to recruit and operate. But, the failure of the transition government to bring in most needed governance and security reforms also was also a major contributor to the conflict and, as a result, the spread of AlQaeda.", "MB: Thanks very much for doing this.", "ND: Thank you. \u2013 by Nadwa Al-Dawsari and Michael Bronner", "Michael Bronner is Editor-at-large for Warscapes magazine.

I want to thank Michael Bronner for the permission to use this article.", "One critical point has to be added: Nadwa Al-Dawsari mentioned that hundreds or even thousands of Houthi fighters would have been trained by Hizbollah in Libanon. Where does she know this from? When this should have happened? Are there any sources she has for that? There must be great doubts at that. Who has seen them in Libanon? It hardly could have been possible to overlook them. And: How should they have got there and back? Hard to imagine. By land: The only way is leading through Saudi Arabia. How they should have managed this by the thousands, even by the hundreds? Saudi Arabia blocked its southern frontier to Yemen even before the war. By sea? The Houthis did not control any port before late 2014. And where to go by boat? Going ashore in Jordan, without having been detected? Or by air plane? From which Yemeni air port such lots of fighters should have started? The Houthis did not control Sanaa and its airport before September, 2014.", "Yemen is a very militarised society. Alreadywhen resisting to the Egyptians in the 1960ies Yemen war, northern Yemeni tribal fighters have shown how well they can fight . They would not be in need of Hizbollah training. What the Houthis seem to have learned from Hizbollah are methods of propaganda - but you do not need any fighters for that.", "11.2.2016 \u2013 Der Standard (** B K)", "Jemen: \"Es gibt keine Guten in diesem Krieg\"", "Von den westlichen Medien weitgehend unbeachtet bombardiert eine von Saudi-Arabien angef\u00fchrte Milit\u00e4rkoalition seit \u00fcber zehn Monaten Rebellen im den Jemen.

With all this, they intended to show that if conditions and provisions of Riyadh are not accepted, they must pay on the battlefield.", "Regardless of what is happening between Riyadh and Ansarol\u00e1, too, there is a large discrepancy between these actors and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). While the Emirati forces have the largest representation among the ground forces of the so-called Saudi coalition against Yemen, there are many differences between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh about the Yemeni political map. In fact, Saudi Arabia, along with forces loyal to Mansur Hadi*, is fighting against the troops of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh; while, on the other hand, the UAE opposes to fight Saleh followers and has even given refuge to members of his family.", "Likewise, the UAE outrightly opposes the Yemeni party \u201cAl Islah\u201d, which has close links to the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia.

There are reports that show that the United Arab Emirates are to sign an agreement with Mahfoudh Khaled Bahah, Yemen\u2019s former Vice President, according to whom, Bahah may empower the southern provinces. Of course, this caused a harsh reaction from Mansur Hadi and the Saudis.", "Now, the different positions of the US and Saudi Arabia about what is happening in Yemen, have triggered concerns around a probable division of the country, like before 1990. The Saudis themselves are concerned that, if this partition occurs, once again, the southern region would be in hands of their opponents.", "Besides all these factors that have prolonged the Saudi war against Yemen, there is also uncertainty that has arisen about the future of Saudi Arabia. When the Saudis attacked Yemen they did not expect such a strong resistance of the Yemeni people\u2019s committees, so Riyadh, which is considered sponsor of takfiri** groups, led ISIS terrorists to this country, and today, these extremists are operating in different parts.", "Thus, if war ended without the annihilation of these terrorists, there is a risk that they would also spread to Saudi Arabia itself and become a threat to the Arab kingdom, perpetuating instability and insecurity in the country.", "However, it should be mentioned that the Saudi invasion of Yemen was a strategic mistake that highlighted the immaturity of leaders in the foreign policy area. Since the era of classical style \u2018land warfare campaigns\u2019 has passed today, it is less common for a country or a government to resort to a military action of this size to achieve their goals.", "In modern times, not even the most powerful countries advocate the armed force option, because of its negative impact on the military, economic and social field; but, what else can we expect from Saudi Arabia that doesn\u2019t even have a powerful army and lacks a thriving defense industry.", "The Saudis, who are eager to appear before the world as a regional power, now, to maintain their reputation, are forced to continue the invasion until they find a favorable alternative. However, this strategic error has staked its existence, especially in the current economic situation, together with the political war that is goung on within its own borders.", "It can be said that with its war against Yemen, the Saudis have committed to an act of political suicide, because apart from the internal affairs they have faced, at the international level they have placed themselves in the focus of criticism from human rights organizations, because of the slaughter of thousands of innocent Yemenis and the total destruction of the country\u2019s infrastructure \u2013 by Rasoul Goudarzi", "**A takfiri is a Sunni Muslim who accuses another Muslim (or an adherent of another Abrahamic faith) of apostasy", "http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/02/10/why-does-saudi-war-against-yemen-not-come-to-an-end/ = (Espanol) http://www.hispantv.com/newsdetail/terrorismo/203905/invasion-arabia-saudita-yemen-ansarullah", "Comment: This is a very interesting piece of writing, outlining and explaining the challenges and tensions between UAE and Saudi (who are meant to be allies); between Islah and UAE; and the problems that Saudi faces as it is trapped in a war that has to have a favourable resolution before it can exit.

So this man is saying it as it is for him. But point one - the Houthis are against government. They are against the present government but they had agreed with the UN envoy Jamal Benomar for a five man ruling team headed by Hadi until elections - and they knew they would not win elections. It was the very unpopular Hadi who reneged on the deal and fled first to Aden and then to Riyadh and asked Saudi to start bombing his own country and people. Secondly the issue of the siege. All Yemen is under blockade and some stuff is getting into Taiz reported by aid organisations, in the background of the speaker you see cars, people and children walking around and not looking like skeletons. Some areas like Saada have a worse humanitarian situation. Thirdly all militias and fighting forces are killing people in Taiz; it is the most brutal part of a terrible, terrible war. I do have sympathy with Taiz - in effect they don't have sympathy with either the old South Yemen or the rest of the North, so they are isolated in their suffering; North and South deride them and deny what they are going through. They also are not supported by UAE as the majority of their fighters are Islah and that is seen as a terrorist organisation by UAE. And of course, the people in Taiz itself are split - many fighting with the Houthi-Saleh alliance against what they see as the invasion by a foreign force. The Islah supporters are the most polarised in Yemen and see only a military victory as a possible outcome; they have long animosity against Saleh for historical reasons. And the southerners remember the Islah militias from Taiz in the 1994 war who so brutally suppressed their hopes of an independent South and hence their animosity. These supporters of Islah don't acknowledge the sufferings of the rest of Yemen, and they don't ever acknowledge the deaths from the Saudi led coalition in Taiz though there is heavy aerial bombardment there. If they did it would be easier somehow to get Yemenis to unite for peace. As it is, many in the rest of Yemen say that there is no problem in Taiz and they cry crocodile tears.

My work on the ground involves spending a lot of time building relationships with locals.", "MB: And, of course, you\u2019re Yemeni. Which part of the country are you from?", "ND: I\u2019m from Taiz.", "MB: One of the most important cities in Yemen\u2026", "ND: Yes, it is. Taiz is important for different reasons. First, it\u2019s the highest-populated area in the country. Taiz is in the middle between former North Yemen and former South Yemen, so geographically, it has a very strategic location. But also, Taiz is very important in the political transition context, because Taizis are the ones who spearheaded the 2011 uprising that led to removing former president Ali Abdullah Saleh from power. It\u2019s also the area where people are the most educated in the country.", "MB: Things are pretty bad there now.", "ND: Yeah, it\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s just beyond brutal for Taizis \u2013 what they have to go through: the tight siege and the fact that medicine, and even water and food supplies, are not allowed into the city. Civilians are being bombed almost constantly on a daily basis and many children and women have been killed. There is a severe shortage of health and other key services. The situation deteriorates every day.", "MB: You\u2019ve come to the US only recently?", "ND: I grew up in the suburbs of Taiz, in the countryside. I did my Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature in Sanaa, and lived and worked in Sanaa until mid-2012, when I moved to the States.", "MB: Your expertise is Yemen\u2019s tribes \u2013 the country\u2019s tribal structure. You always hear, in the most basic descriptions of Yemen, that it\u2019s a \u201ctribal society.\u201d What does that really mean in the Yemeni context?", "ND: Some 70 percent of the population lives in rural areas, and most of these are tribal areas. The state and the government have very little presence, if any. So, in the Yemeni context, strong tribes mean that a mechanism exists that has, in the absence of the state, provided local people with key services, particularly related to justice and security. People tend to cherish their tribal identity and be proud of it, especially in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country. That\u2019s because the tribes provide them with protection, with the sense of community and support. That doesn\u2019t mean that local people in tribal areas don\u2019t have aspirations to see functioning state institutions. It is actually the opposite, according to my research. The tribal system has grown weaker over the past decades, and it\u2019s become much less effective than it used to be in terms of its ability to address conflicts, which led to more conflicts and more security problems. That is why tribal people have a strong desire to see courts and a security presence established in their areas.", "MB: Just to step back, when were the prospects best for Yemen? When did things really work smoothly? You can go back as far as you want.", "ND: Well, let me talk about modern Yemen. (In the old times, of course, you\u2019re talking about the Queen of Sheba, and then Queen Arwa \u2013 but that\u2019s a long time ago!) In the modern history, I think Yemen was relatively stable and better off during the \u201880s, when oil was just discovered and there was a large Yemeni diaspora in the Gulf countries, particularly in Saudi Arabia \u2013 Yemenis who were sending money back home. So the economy was blooming back in the \u201880s, and I think those were, relatively speaking, the happiest days of modern Yemen.", "MB: The US became heavily involved with Yemen after 9/11, but through a very narrow focus on counterterrorism. What effect did that have on the fabric of government and the fabric of the tribal society?", "ND: Yes, the US has focused mainly on security and counterterrorism. That\u2019s why the US was supportive of Ali Abdullah Saleh, a dictator who abused his power and who was extremely corrupt. He was manipulating al-Qaeda all along and was using the militant group for political gain, which has been confirmed in recent reports. US assistance to Saleh helped him solidify his regime and strengthen his and his family\u2019s grip over power and resources. A lot of the military aid that US provided went to army and security units that were led by his son and nephews. This undermined governance and contributed to corruption, both were and have been strong causes of conflict in the country, including tribal areas, and a factor in the cause of the current war.", "MB: I spent time in Yemen in early 2002, shortly after 9/11, when the US was exerting tremendous pressure on Saleh to conform to US counterterrorism policies. The American Ambassador, who was a counterterrorism figure at the State Department before he became ambassador, told me at the time that there were basically maybe six people in the whole country \u2013 six people tied to al-Qaeda \u2013 that they were very worried about. Just six! But since that time, during the period of cooperation with Saleh, there have been literally hundreds of drone strikes and al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula has become a force. How do you account for this sense now that Yemen is full of al-Qaeda?", "ND: The assumption has always been that a strong central government is crucial to counterterrorism, which is quite misleading in the context of Yemen, where the central government is pretty corrupt. In other words, the problem was not in the fact that the central government was weak. The problem was in the fact that the government was too centralized and too corrupt. What Yemen needed was strong local security. Yemen needed local police. Yemen needed local institutions that are accountable and transparent, that can provide services to the people. Because local institutions were underdeveloped and often hijacked by the central government, corruption prevailed and grievances increased. It\u2019s because of corruption that unemployment and poverty increased, and people grew very frustrated with the government. A lot of these young people who have no jobs have fought: Some of them joined al-Qaeda and other armed groups, not because they believe in the ideology, but because they\u2019re too frustrated with the government. The same thing was true, for example, in the South, when the government fought al-Qaeda in early 2014. Some members of the Southern Movement [who support a dissolution of the single state into the pre-1990 South and North Yemen] fought with al-Qaeda. These are secular people. But they fought with al-Qaeda because they\u2019re fighting a common enemy, which is a Yemeni government that they see as illegitimate.", "MB: If you\u2019re thinking about the war right now, we\u2019re seeing horrible images not only from Taiz, but also from Sanaa, the capital. Are these representations emblematic of the situation across the country \u2013 is it all in turmoil \u2013 or does it vary?", "ND: The country is in turmoil, but certain areas are definitely worse than others. They\u2019re all bad, but Taiz definitely the most affected. You also have areas like Sa\u2019ada which has been severely bombed by airstrikes. The South is a time bomb. The security situation in the South is very alarming and continues to deteriorate everyday. You hear reports about the spread of al-Qaeda and other extremist elements. There are different southern factions that are deeply divided and now armed. The governor of Shebwa [governorate], in an interview last week, said al-Qaeda is planning to take over Shebwa and Abyan. If that happens, two major governorates will be under the control of al-Qaeda. The government is absent in the South, and at the same time there is an unprecedented influx of arms that are falling into the hands of al-Qaeda, tribes and local groups. This is a recipe for prolonged and widespread conflict.", "MB: If you were to trace the deeper roots of the war that\u2019s raging now, how far back would you go?", "ND: The root cause of this war is the fact that the Northern elite have always had a monopoly over resources and power while the rest of the country is marginalized. This was the case for the thousand years during which the Zaydi Imams ruled the country, and continued after they were toppled in 1962. When Saleh came to power, the Northern elite continued to control power and resources. It was Saleh\u2019s family; Saleh\u2019s extended tribe, Sanhan; his allies from the powerful tribal Ahmar family; and his patronage network of tribal and religious leaders and other influential figures across the country. What we have seen over the past two decades, and in particular since 2011, is the manifestation of a power struggle among these Northern elite alliance players who have since become enemies because of competition over who controls reseources in Yemen. Now, add the Houthis, who are an extension of the Zaydi Hashimites that have morphed into a rebel group. So the root cause is essentially the chronic power struggle among the Northern political elites coupled with the systematic marginalization of the rest of the country.", "MB: But there are a lot of outside forces at play as well, obviously.", "ND: Yes, that\u2019s true. The Saudis are involved, and now the Iranians are involved too. The Qataris are involved. The Emiratis are involved. All these outside forces have backed up different parties of the conflict, but the conflict is Yemeni. The Houthis are not fighting with Hadi [Yemen\u2019s president] because Iran asked them to fight Hadi. The same holds true with forces fighting the Houthis and Saleh: They\u2019re not fighting because the Saudis gave them money to fight. The struggle is Yemeni versus Yemeni. The conflict is Yemeni versus Yemeni. Outside forces are only contributing to the conflict, and are making it worse.", "MB: Can we just go through some of the players? In the most basic terms, tell me what they want in this war, starting with the Houthis.", "ND: The Houthis emerged back in the early \u201890s, and they weren\u2019t named Houthis back then. They were a newly-formed cultural movement called the Believing Youth. The purpose of the movement was to revive the Zaydi tradition in Sa\u2019ada, which was made in response to the strong presence of an extreme Salafi institute in Sa\u2019ada, the Dar al-Hadith Center, which was preaching anti-Zaidism [Zaidism is an early sect of Shi\u2019a Islam \u2013 comprising some 35-40 percent of Yemen\u2019s Muslim population \u2013 that emerged in the 8th century]. But then the movement grew and it changed in nature. Hussein Bader Al-Deen Al-Houthi, who was one of sons of the founders of the Believing Youth, turned it into a rebel movement in the early 2000s. They fought six wars with the government between 2004 and 2010. The Houthis took part in the 2011 uprising and they took part in the National Dialogue Conference. But then they allied with former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and they staged a coup in September 2014.", "MB: Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, who was Saleh\u2019s vice president, was essentially Saleh\u2019s hand-picked successor. What happened, and how did it help precipitate the war?", "ND: I think Saleh was okay with Hadi taking his place because Hadi was Saleh\u2019s man for sixteen years. And so, Saleh thought that he could still rule Yemen through Hadi. But then, Hadi broke away from Saleh\u2019s control.", "MB: In terms of Hadi\u2019s anti-corruption measures \u2013 things like that?", "ND: When Hadi started removing Saleh\u2019s relatives from key positions \u2013 including Saleh\u2019s son, nephew and brother \u2013 it became clear to Saleh that Hadi is no longer \u201cunder the influence\u201d of Saleh\u2019s control. Saleh then started mobilizing against Hadi and the government, allying with Houthis and supporting them militarily and financially, which helped them sweep through Amran and eventually take the capital city, Sanaa, by force.", "MB: Another key player is Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, the former general and business tycoon\u2026", "ND: Ali Mohsen was Saleh\u2019s confidant and companion for 30-something years. They were partners. Saleh could not have done what he did \u2013 meaning establishing himself in power \u2013 without Ali Mohsen\u2019s support. He was his right hand man. The two were on good terms until the early 2000s, when Saleh established the Republican Guard and made his son the commander. And so, it became clear to Ali Mohsen, and to the al-Ahmar family, Saleh\u2019s key allies since he came to power \u2013 that Saleh was preparing his son to become the next president. An official or a written agreement between the three \u2013 Ali Abdullah Saleh, Ali Mohsen and the al-Ahmar family \u2013 was that they would rule together and agree on arrangements on how to do that. But then, when Saleh started preparing his son to become the next president, that\u2019s where the relationship went sour between Ali Mohsen, Ali Saleh and the al-Ahmars and that is when power struggle started.", "MB: How, from this internal power struggle, did the Saudis come to begin the current bombing campaign in Yemen?", "ND: The Saudis have had heavy influence in Yemen since the \u201870s. Saleh was a Saudi puppet, as was his regime. That includes Ali Mohsen and al-Ahmars. The Saudis have always feared Yemen. In particular, they\u2019ve always feared that any development or progress in Yemen towards democracy would incite calls for political reforms in their country. Through supporting Saleh and his regime, the Saudis helped maintain corruption and limit the chances for a genuine democracy to take place. When the Houthis suddenly emerged as a political and military force, the Saudis felt threatened because the Houthis were close to their regional rival, Iran. When Hadi\u2019s government failed to stop the Houthis and eventually collapsed, the Saudis decided to intervene to prevent an any potential Iranian control in its backyard, Yemen.", "MB: Would you say that, in the past, the Saudis\u2019 control had been fairly agile? They understand Yemen and the powers at play, and in the past, they\u2019ve controlled them fairly adeptly?", "ND: They did, but it was short-sighted because they thought that they could control Yemen forever despite the growing turmoil. Again, the Saudis \u2013 and it\u2019s the same thing with the US, and the international community more broadly \u2013 always look at national actors. The Saudis thought that they could perpetually control Yemen through the Saleh regime, and they did for a while. But that didn\u2019t last because the regime itself started losing control. Widespread corruption and systematic marginalization fueled local grievances over the years leading to the 2011 uprising that pushed Saleh out of power. Then comes the GCC sponsored UN-US-backed transition deal, which had major flaws. It sort of recycled Saleh\u2019s regime while granting him immunity, and no substantial political reforms happened because of that. Tension continues to build up, and if you look at Yemen today, you will see that many local forces have taken up arms and fought as they\u2019ve grown tired of national actors and the Northern elite\u2019s hegemony. Those cannot be \u201ctamed\u201d with another deal that maintains national actors, be it the Houthis or Saleh\u2019s allies, or even Hadi and his government. No one can control all of Yemen anymore.", "MB: Would you say the same is true for the US and its short involvement in Yemen \u2013 that the US misunderstood the flows of power?", "ND: Yes, definitely. The US government and the international community have always looked at Yemen through the lens of Sanaa and the lens of national actors. First it was the Saleh government, then Hadi. The US and the international community continued to overlook the local dynamics and local conflicts that are increasingly shaping the conflict and are the key to the solution.", "MB: If you consider the current bombing \u2013 the Saudi air strikes, which have wrought such havoc, and also US drone strikes, which are ongoing \u2013 it\u2019s hard to figure out what the purpose is. It doesn\u2019t seem like there's very much to bomb that might resolve anything in Yemen.", "ND: That is true. The country\u2019s infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, bridges, you name it, has been destroyed. Thousands of civilians have been killed. It didn\u2019t change much except that the situation worsened and continues to deteriorate.", "MB: Insofar as the US is currently supporting the Saudis and the coalition, how is the US role perceived right now?", "ND: Among the Houthis and their supporters, and those who are most affected by the air strikes, there is resentment. Last month, the US signed a $ 1 billion dollar arms agreement with the Saudi government. A proposal by the Netherlands to set up a committee to investigate into war crimes in Yemen was dropped because it didn\u2019t have sufficient backing from key countries including the US. It gives the impression that the US is complicit in supporting war crimes committed by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. On the other hand, the US government was reluctant at the beginning to condemn the Houthi/Saleh take-over of the capital by force. In October last year, US drone strikes in Radaa targeted AlQaeda but also tribesmen who were fighting Houthis. This actually helped the Houthis control the town and surrounding areas. It created resentment towards t he US among local tribes that resisted the Houthis advance into their areas. As a result, there is a strong perception that the US is also in bed with Iran and hence Houthis.MB: To what extent would you credit, among the myriad of dynamics at play, the Saudi-Iranian animosity and a sense of proxy war?", "ND: I don\u2019t think Iran is dictating what the Houthis are doing, but Iran has certainly supported the Houthis a lot. Many Houthis \u2013 hundreds, if not thousands \u2013 were trained by Hezbollah in Lebanon, and trained in Iran as well. You can trace the influence of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard training in the way Houthis conduct their operations and how they go after their opponents, as well as in the way their security apparatus is functioning. When the Houthis took over before the Saudi\u2019s intervened, a Houthi delegation visited Iran and signed a deal with the Iranian government that includes operating fourteen flights per week between Sanaa and Tehran. They\u2019ve reinforced the Saudis\u2019 fears, valid or not, that Iran is utilizing the Houthis to disrupt Saudi Arabia. The Saudis also supported local actors to fight Houthis. The Houthis are not fighting on behalf of Iran, and local actors are not fighting on behalf of Saudi Arabia. Anti-Houthi local actors are using Saudi money and support to push the Houthis out of their regions. Same thing with the Houthis; they\u2019re using Iran\u2019s support to extend their power to as large an area as possible in the country.", "MB: Is it possible for anyone to win the war at this point?", "ND: I don\u2019t think so. The political process seems to be hitting a dead end. There are no signs of good will to enter into political negotiations whatsoever from wither side. The Houthis have increased their offensive in Taiz and Mareb. In Taiz, they\u2019ve been enforcing a tight siege, preventing medicine, food and even water from entering the city. They\u2019ve been bombing the city every day, killing dozens of civilians. At the same time, the airstrikes intensified especially in the areas under Houthi control in the North, and many civilians were killed because of that. It seems that the Houthis, and the Saudis, are more interested in resolving this militarily. But when you look at the military operations, you see that for the past months, it\u2019s been more or less a stalemate. The Houthis advance, and then pro-Hadi government and local forces push them out, and then the Houthis advance again and so on and so forth. It\u2019s been pretty much stagnant. I think it\u2019s going to be a long war, unless somehow, miraculously, conflict sides agree to negotiations in good faith.", "MB: Just to go back to the protests in 2011, which is the most immediate spark to the current conflict, there\u2019s tendency to lump all of the different Arab countries\u2019 uprisings under the vague category of Arab Spring. In Yemen, what were the particular dynamics at play, and how do these fit in the path towards war?", "ND: In 2011, yes, the protesters were inspired by what happened in Tunisia and Egypt. But then, Yemenis have been protesting since the early 2000s against the government. Yemeni activists were protesting in front of the cabinet and in front of the Presidential Palace against corruption, injustice and human rights abuses. Yemen\u2019s uprising was driven by 20 years of political marginalization and unaddressed local grievances. But, like other Arab Spring countries, the uprising in Yemen was about ending the control by a small political elite over power and wealth; it was about revolting against marginalization, corruption, injustice and human rights abuses. It was about the desire to end tyranny.", "MB: The period that you just described \u2013 the early 2000s into 2011 \u2013 is the exact same period that the US has partnered with Saleh and counter terrorism\u2026", "ND: Yes. The US government has turned a blind eye to Saleh\u2019s human rights abuses and his corruption, simply because he was an ally in the war on terror.", "MB: Is it fair to say that the resources his government received from the US enabled him to enrich his family?", "ND: I think it is fair to say that. Saleh used the counter terrorism assistance to strengthen his and his family\u2019s grip over power. His son was the head of the Special Forces and nephew was the head of Central Security Forces, the two armed units that received extensive training and support from the US as part of the CT partnership. After a decade of support, Saleh\u2019s family\u2019s grip on power became stronger, and in reaction, Yemen\u2019s al-Qaeda faction did too.", "MB: The Houthis, who have fought six wars with Saleh\u2019s government, are now allied with Saleh (now that he\u2019s out of power). What is the timetable for this about-face?", "ND: It\u2019s hard to track in definite terms, but we could see patterns beginning in 2011 when the Houthis started fighting with the tribes in Al Jawf and Marib. It was clear that the Houthis had access to arms \u2013 heavy arms \u2013 that they wouldn\u2019t have access to unless somebody gave it to them, and that was Saleh. Their dramatic expansion across Yemen in 2014 was also facilitated by tribal leaders who are loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh.", "MB: To what do you describe the growth of ISIS? Similar to what Al-Qaeda experienced in the early 2000s?", "ND: In my opinion, it is hard to confirm the presence of ISIS in Yemen. Are there individuals who are sympathetic with ISIS? Probably yes. But does ISIS exist as a group? I don\u2019t think that there is enough evidence to confirm that yet. ISIS does not have any documented presence in Yemen. With Al-Qaeda, we know who they are. We know the names of their leaders .We know which tribes they come from and which ones they interact with. We know which areas they control. With ISIS, there\u2019s none of that. They clearly don\u2019t control any areas. Tweets, videos and photos of masked men with pick-up trucks, guns and black flags cannot be assumed to be evidence of an ISIS existence. ISIS could be part of the propaganda, or it could comprise an attempt by some local armed groups, extremist or otherwise, to brand themselves. Having said that, it is a problem by itself and debating whether it is ISIS or not is not as relevant as is the need to bring functioning government institutions to the entire country and establish security to prevent further deterioration.", "MB: But al-Qaeda has grown as a result of the conflict. What\u2019s the main reason for that?", "ND: Let\u2019s take the South, for example. During the fighting since March, police stations have closed down. Security forces withdrew from most governorates. The courts closed. Most of the South remained with no functioning police and security forces, no functioning courts, no functioning government. Al-Qaeda can come into any city when there is no government in place that can stop them. There has also been an influx of weapons and heavy arms everywhere because of the looting of army bases over the past few years. Local governments don\u2019t have the capacity to stand up to al-Qaeda. Same thing with the tribes. Let\u2019s take Al Bayda, where the tribes in the past have successfully limited al-Qaeda\u2019s presence and activities. In 2014, when these tribes were pushed to fight the Houthis, they joined hands with al-Qaeda. They\u2019re not trying to limit al-Qaeda\u2019s presence anymore, because they want help in pushing the Houthis out of their areas. The government collapsed and violent conflicts spread in many parts of the country. This chaos offers the perfect environment for al-Qaeda to recruit and operate. But, the failure of the transition government to bring in most needed governance and security reforms also was also a major contributor to the conflict and, as a result, the spread of AlQaeda.", "MB: Thanks very much for doing this.", "ND: Thank you. \u2013 by Nadwa Al-Dawsari and Michael Bronner", "Michael Bronner is Editor-at-large for Warscapes magazine.

Where does she know this from? When this should have happened? Are there any sources she has for that? There must be great doubts at that. Who has seen them in Libanon? It hardly could have been possible to overlook them. And: How should they have got there and back? Hard to imagine. By land: The only way is leading through Saudi Arabia. How they should have managed this by the thousands, even by the hundreds? Saudi Arabia blocked its southern frontier to Yemen even before the war. By sea? The Houthis did not control any port before late 2014. And where to go by boat? Going ashore in Jordan, without having been detected? Or by air plane? From which Yemeni air port such lots of fighters should have started? The Houthis did not control Sanaa and its airport before September, 2014.", "Yemen is a very militarised society. Alreadywhen resisting to the Egyptians in the 1960ies Yemen war, northern Yemeni tribal fighters have shown how well they can fight . They would not be in need of Hizbollah training.

And of course, the people in Taiz itself are split - many fighting with the Houthi-Saleh alliance against what they see as the invasion by a foreign force. The Islah supporters are the most polarised in Yemen and see only a military victory as a possible outcome; they have long animosity against Saleh for historical reasons. And the southerners remember the Islah militias from Taiz in the 1994 war who so brutally suppressed their hopes of an independent South and hence their animosity. These supporters of Islah don't acknowledge the sufferings of the rest of Yemen, and they don't ever acknowledge the deaths from the Saudi led coalition in Taiz though there is heavy aerial bombardment there.

These Saudi-funded and promoted institutions have been the wellspring of militant ideology embodied in al Qaeda and now Islamic State (IS), which is causing havoc, starting with the al Qaeda-linked 9/11 attacks in the US and now by IS militants in a number of countries. With no demonstrable popular support at home by way of periodic elections or in any other way, the Saudi monarchy has sought to establish legitimacy by championing Islamic orthodoxy combined with the custodianship of the Islamic faith\u2019s holiest sites. Its strategic and economic ties with the US underwrote its security and continue to do so. Saudi Arabia\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest oil producer and the US\u2019s increasing dependence on oil imports from it during much of the last century, created a symbiotic relationship between the two countries that seemed to override other considerations.", "However, things are changing slowly, creating even greater nervousness in the Kingdom.

Washington seemed to be exploring ways of dealing within the region outside the box to give its policy some flexibility, however limited. In other words, Saudi Arabia was still an important element of its Middle Eastern policy but it seemed to be losing its veto power. And the Saudis have reacted badly to it, having never believed in the efficacy of diplomacy to deal with contentious regional issues because that is indicative of weakness and vulnerability.", "On the surface, they must show strength against their enemies at home and abroad. And that was unequivocally demonstrated with the execution of the prominent Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr for alleged terrorism offences. This seemed to have been done without consulting the US as Washington was taken aback, counselling both Iran, where anti-Saudi protesters vandalized the Saudi embassy in the midst of strong protests, and Saudi Arabia to exercise restraint. Riyadh seemed keen to demonstrate its strength and resolve to crush any kind of dissidence as terrorism. At the same time, this sounded like the dangerous tantrums of a child used to having its own way.

Aided in part by satellite TV channels, guest lectures, and his powerful presence on social media, the preacher has been embraced, sometimes physically, by religious and political elites in all five of the Sunni-ruled Arab Gulf states.", "In an era of harsh sectarian warfare and military gains by the Islamic State, the Gulf is desperately in need of more love, brotherhood and tolerance. But achieving this requires America\u2019s Arab Gulf allies to stop granting state privileges to prominent preachers of such obvious intolerance, including Moghamsy.
