Still following Smith, it is also wise to attend to the \u201cvile maxim\u201d to which the \u201cmasters of mankind\u201d are dedicated: \u201cAll for ourselves and nothing for other people\u201d -- a doctrine known otherwise as bitter and incessant class war, often one-sided, much to the detriment of the people of the home country and the world.", "In the contemporary global order, the institutions of the masters hold enormous power, not only in the international arena but also within their home states, on which they rely to protect their power and to provide economic support by a wide variety of means. When we consider the role of the masters of mankind, we turn to such state policy priorities of the moment as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the investor-rights agreements mislabeled \u201cfree-trade agreements\u201d in propaganda and commentary.", "The Second Superpower", "The neoliberal programs of the past generation have concentrated wealth and power in far fewer hands while undermining functioning democracy, but they have aroused opposition as well", "The rising opposition to the neoliberal assault highlights another crucial aspect of the standard convention: it sets aside the public, which often fails to accept the approved role of \u201cspectators\u201d (rather than \u201cparticipants\u201d) assigned to it in liberal democratic theory.", "There is far more to say, of course, about the factors in determining state policy that are put to the side when we adopt the standard convention that states are the actors in international affairs. But with such nontrivial caveats as these, let us nevertheless adopt the convention, at least as a first approximation to reality. Then the question of who rules the world leads at once to such concerns as China\u2019s rise to power and its challenge to the United States and \u201cworld order,\u201d the new cold war simmering in eastern Europe, the Global War on Terror, American hegemony and American decline, and a range of similar considerations.", "Western Power Under Pressure", "There is far more to say, of course, about the factors in determining state policy that are put to the side when we adopt the standard convention that states are the actors in international affairs.

Bush declared in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attack. To be more accurate, re-declared. The GWOT was declared by the Reagan administration when it took office, with fevered rhetoric about a \u201cplague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself\u201d (as Reagan put it) and a \u201creturn to barbarism in the modern age\u201d (the words of George Shultz, his secretary of state). The original GWOT has been quietly removed from history. It very quickly turned into a murderous and destructive terrorist war afflicting Central America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, with grim repercussions to the present, even leading to condemnation of the United States by the World Court (which Washington dismissed). In any event, it is not the right story for history, so it is gone.", "The success of the Bush-Obama version of GWOT can readily be evaluated on direct inspection. When the war was declared, the terrorist targets were confined to a small corner of tribal Afghanistan. They were protected by Afghans, who mostly disliked or despised them, under the tribal code of hospitality -- which baffled Americans when poor peasants refused \u201cto turn over Osama bin Laden for the, to them, astronomical sum of $25 million.\u201d", "There are good reasons to believe that a well-constructed police action, or even serious diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban, might have placed those suspected of the 9/11 crimes in American hands for trial and sentencing. But such options were off the table. Instead, the reflexive choice was large-scale violence -- not with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban (that came later) but to make clear U.S. contempt for tentative Taliban offers of the possible extradition of bin Laden. How serious these offers were we do not know, since the possibility of exploring them was never entertained. Or perhaps the United States was just intent on \u201ctrying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don\u2019t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose.\u201d", "That was the judgment of the highly respected anti-Taliban leader Abdul Haq, one of the many oppositionists who condemned the American bombing campaign launched in October 2001 as \"a big setback\" for their efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within, a goal they considered within their reach. His judgment is confirmed by Richard A. Clarke, who was chairman of the Counterterrorism Security Group at the White House under President George W. Bush when the plans to attack Afghanistan were made. As Clarke describes the meeting, when informed that the attack would violate international law, \"the President yelled in the narrow conference room, \u2018I don\u2019t care what the international lawyers say, we are going to kick some ass.'\" The attack was also bitterly opposed by the major aid organizations working in Afghanistan, who warned that millions were on the verge of starvation and that the consequences might be horrendous.", "The consequences for poor Afghanistan years later need hardly be reviewed.", "The next target of the sledgehammer was Iraq. The U.S.-UK invasion, utterly without credible pretext, is the major crime of the twenty-first century. The invasion led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people in a country where the civilian society had already been devastated by American and British sanctions that were regarded as \u201cgenocidal\u201d by the two distinguished international diplomats who administered them, and resigned in protest for this reason. The invasion also generated millions of refugees, largely destroyed the country, and instigated a sectarian conflict that is now tearing apart Iraq and the entire region. It is an astonishing fact about our intellectual and moral culture that in informed and enlightened circles it can be called, blandly, \u201cthe liberation of Iraq.\u201d", "Pentagon and British Ministry of Defense polls found that only 3% of Iraqis regarded the U.S. security role in their neighborhood as legitimate, less than 1% believed that \u201ccoalition\u201d (U.S.-UK) forces were good for their security, 80% opposed the presence of coalition forces in the country, and a majority supported attacks on coalition troops. Afghanistan has been destroyed beyond the possibility of reliable polling, but there are indications that something similar may be true there as well. Particularly in Iraq the United States suffered a severe defeat, abandoning its official war aims, and leaving the country under the influence of the sole victor, Iran.", "The sledgehammer was also wielded elsewhere, notably in Libya, where the three traditional imperial powers (Britain, France, and the United States) procured Security Council resolution 1973 and instantly violated it, becoming the air force of the rebels. The effect was to undercut the possibility of a peaceful, negotiated settlement; sharply increase casualties (by at least a factor of 10, according to political scientist Alan Kuperman); leave Libya in ruins, in the hands of warring militias; and, more recently, to provide the Islamic State with a base that it can use to spread terror beyond. Quite sensible diplomatic proposals by the African Union, accepted in principle by Libya\u2019s Muammar Qaddafi, were ignored by the imperial triumvirate, as Africa specialist Alex de Waal reviews. A huge flow of weapons and jihadis has spread terror and violence from West Africa (now the champion for terrorist murders) to the Levant, while the NATO attack also sent a flood of refugees from Africa to Europe.", "Yet another triumph of \u201chumanitarian intervention,\u201d and, as the long and often ghastly record reveals, not an unusual one, going back to its modern origins four centuries ago \u2013 by Noam Chomsky", "http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176137/", "10.5.2016 \u2013 Tom Dispatch (*** B K P T)", "Masters of Mankind: the Costs of Violence", "[This piece, the second of two parts, is excerpted from Noam Chomsky\u2019s new book, Who Rules the World? (Metropolitan Books). Part 1 can be found by clicking here.]", "In brief, the Global War on Terror sledgehammer strategy has spread jihadi terror from a tiny corner of Afghanistan to much of the world, from Africa through the Levant and South Asia to Southeast Asia. It has also incited attacks in Europe and the United States. The invasion of Iraq made a substantial contribution to this process, much as intelligence agencies had predicted. Terrorism specialists Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank estimate that the Iraq War \u201cgenerated a stunning sevenfold increase in the yearly rate of fatal jihadist attacks, amounting to literally hundreds of additional terrorist attacks and thousands of civilian lives lost; even when terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan is excluded, fatal attacks in the rest of the world have increased by more than one-third.\u201d Other exercises have been similarly productive.", "More generally, studies carried out by the Oslo Peace Research Institute show that two-thirds of the region\u2019s conflict fatalities were produced in originally internal disputes where outsiders imposed their solutions. In such conflicts, 98% of fatalities were produced only after outsiders had entered the domestic dispute with their military might.", "The evidence reviewed by political scientist Timo Kivim\u00e4ki indicates that the \u201cprotection wars [fought by \u2018coalitions of the willing\u2019] have become the main source of violence in the world, occasionally contributing over 50% of total conflict fatalities.\u201d Furthermore, in many of these cases, including Syria, as he reviews, there were opportunities for diplomatic settlement that were ignored. That has also been true in other horrific situations, including the Balkans in the early 1990s, the first Gulf War, and of course the Indochina wars, the worst crime since World War II. In the case of Iraq the question does not even arise. There surely are some lessons here.", "The general consequences of resorting to the sledgehammer against vulnerable societies comes as little surprise. William Polk\u2019s careful study of insurgencies, Violent Politics, should be essential reading for those who want to understand today\u2019s conflicts.", "Polk reveals a pattern that has been replicated over and over. The invaders \u2014 perhaps professing the most benign motives \u2014 are naturally disliked by the population, who disobey them, at first in small ways, eliciting a forceful response, which increases opposition and support for resistance. The cycle of violence escalates until the invaders withdraw \u2014 or gain their ends by something that may approach genocide.", "Obama\u2019s global drone assassination campaign, a remarkable innovation in global terrorism, exhibits the same patterns. By most accounts, it is generating terrorists more rapidly than it is murdering those suspected of someday intending to harm us.", "Another characteristic feature of such interventions is the belief that the insurgency will be overcome by eliminating its leaders. But when such an effort succeeds, the reviled leader is regularly replaced by someone younger, more determined, more brutal, and more effective.", "Careful studies of al-Qaeda and ISIS have shown that the United States and its allies are following their game plan with some precision. Their goal is to \u201cdraw the West as deeply and actively as possible into the quagmire\u201d and \u201cto perpetually engage and enervate the United States and the West in a series of prolonged overseas ventures\u201d in which they will undermine their own societies, expend their resources, and increase the level of violence, setting off the dynamic that Polk reviews.", "And if we continue to wield the sledgehammer, tacitly following the jihadi script, the likely effect is even more violent jihadism with broader appeal. The record, Atran advises, \u201cshould inspire a radical change in our counter-strategies.\u201d", "Repeated Western interventions since then in the Middle East and Africa have exacerbated the tensions, conflicts, and disruptions that have shattered the societies. The end result is a \u201crefugee crisis\u201d that the innocent West can scarcely endure.", "Returning to the opening question \u201cWho rules the world?\u201d we might also want to pose another question: \u201cWhat principles and values rule the world?\u201d That question should be foremost in the minds of the citizens of the rich and powerful states, who enjoy an unusual legacy of freedom, privilege, and opportunity thanks to the struggles of those who came before them, and who now face fateful choices as to how to respond to challenges of great human import \u2013 by Noam Chomsky", "http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176138/tomgram%3A_noam_chomsky%2C_what_principles_rule_the_world = http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/05/10/masters-of-mankind-the-costs-of-violence/", "This is like a comment to this article: US lies for war - from Vietnam to Syria.

We can look at Iraq, we can look at Afghanistan, we can look at the situation in Libya and also the situation in Syria, and of course in Yemen. The US some 14 months ago withdrew special forces; they evacuated their embassy in Yemen. That signaled the Saudi and Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] coalition to begin a bombing campaign, which has continued for over the last 14 months not against Al-Qaeda and other Islamist extremist organizations, but against the [Jund] Ansar Allah. The Houthi movement\u2026 is in alliance with Islamic Republic of Iran \u2013 their objective is to stop the Houthi movement across Yemen. If you look at the alliances that were formed against the advances of the Houthi, [they] have nothing to do with the fight against Al-Qaeda.

But what contributed to this instability in the first place?", "AA: It\u2019s been a failed US policy in Yemen. It\u2019s been several years that they have been carrying out this so-called targeted associations against Al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula. But mostly people who have been killed were not the Al-Qaeda operatives \u2013 many of them were innocent civilians, or people who could not be directly linked to Al-Qaeda. What we have in Yemen is a representation of a failed US policy throughout the region. It\u2019s absurd for Peter Cook, the spokesperson for the Pentagon, to even suggest that this redeployment of US forces has anything to do with fighting Al-Qaeda. Their main objectives there are to prevent and contain the influence of Iran. This ties in with their foreign policy in Syria, where they\u2019ve backed these extremist organizations which have caused tremendous death and destruction in Syria, and of course they are reentering Iraq. They have deployed additional troops to Syria. As well, they are jockeying for another deployment into Libya in North Africa. So this is a representation of the same policy that emanates from successive US administrations \u2013 both Democratic, as well as Republican.", "RT: The news about sending the military into Yemen quietly emerged on Friday evening.

What was frustrating for me as a paediatrician was to see children with deteriorating health condition that could have been avoided if these children had earlier access to primary healthcare when they needed it. The results were fatal sometimes. I remember receiving some children who had chest infections, which spread to the brain to become meningitis.

This ends a year of occupation and brings to a close what is effectively the third emirate or statelet AQAP has either set up or attempted to set up in Yemen since 2011.

Much to Bin Ladin\u2019s disappointment, the Yemeni population bought into Yemeni unification and the tribal and patronage networks of the new system.

Al-Wuhayshi, al-Qaeda\u2019s general manager as well as AQAP\u2019s leader, understood that the project in Yemen had gone wrong. On 21 May 2012, weeks before AQAP was ejected from Ja\u2019ar and its statelet disbanded, al-Wuhayshi wrote to Abdelmalik Droukdel (Abu Musab Abdul Wadud), the leader of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which had invaded northern Mali in January 2012 and received an enormous boost after the military overthrew the government in March, leaving Bamako a shambles as the jihadists dug in. Still, al-Wuhayshi sensed danger, warning AQIM of the need to \u201ckeep the [media] message under control,\u201d and cautioning that AQAP had learned lessons from its mistakes that had now united tribes, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Salafists against them.", "The themes of al-Qaeda\u2019s new model were sharpening into view: Muslim societies had been stripped of real religious understanding (the notion of Sayyid Qutb that this was a new age of jahiliya, ignorance and paganism) and therefore had to be led gradually back into it; applying the full shari\u2019a immediately would lead to a rejection of the jihadists and their ideas, not least because so many enemies were waiting for the jihadists to falter in order to take advantage and extinguish the true Islam; and the key to success was to make the population and al-Qaeda co-dependent\u2014al-Qaeda would solve the population\u2019s most pressing needs (whether that was fighting the government or social services) so that population felt its interests were coterminous with al-Qaeda\u2019s and would protect the group, providing a bodyguard and durable roots for al-Qaeda\u2019s global agenda.", "These lessons had been assimilated when AQAP overran al-Mukalla on 3 April 2015, capturing large amounts of American-supplied equipment, the day after AQAP had systematically seized key facilities, including Hadramut Province\u2019s security headquarters, the local police station, provincial administrative offices, a branch of the central bank, and the Central Prison, breaking free more than three-hundred people, including Khaled al-Batarfi, an AQAP military operations chief for Abyan and Baydah Provinces when he was captured in March 2011. This time, AQAP would \u201cpose as a local protector-savior rather than an overlord in Mukalla,\u201d as Yemen researcher Elisabeth Kendall noted. AQAP\u2019s ideology was not widely shared in the areas it captured, but the creation of a pseudo-state where \u201ceven its detractors grudgingly acknowledged that AQAP was approachable, had some sense of justice and got things done,\u201d meant AQAP \u201csucceed in building tolerance for [its presence], if not outright support,\u201d Kendall adds.", "AQAP\u2019s capture of al-Mukalla came just over a week after a Saudi-led coalition launched Operation DECISIVE STORM on 25 March 2015, which was designed to push back the Houthis and restore the political process. With other priorities, the Saudi-led forces had, until April 2016, essentially ignored AQAP and AQAP had kept very quiet about its holdings, not claiming any kind of state or emirate, and worked to embed itself within the wider insurgent movement in Yemen. AQAP is not as powerful as al-Qaeda\u2019s Syrian branch, Jabhat al-Nusra, the self-conscious culmination of al-Qaeda\u2019s refinement to its model of durable governance, but AQAP has made itself virtually indistinguishable from large sections of the Yemeni insurgency.", "Moreover, when AQAP was removed from al-Mukalla on 24 April 2016, it is more precise to say it removed itself. There was a major ground operation of more than 2,000 foreign troops and local forces led by the United Arab Emirates into al-Mukalla, but while the Coalition claimed that 800 AQAP jihadists had been killed, the real figure is probably closer to sixty. AQAP itself said that it had withdrawn\u2014ostensibly to protect civilians\u2014rather than having been routed. In short, after a year of controlling the city, embedding itself into social networks, proselytizing, collecting taxes, looting arms munitions and banks, AQAP pulled out of al-Mukalla and lived to fight another day. Thus, the suggestion this is as big a victory as if IS had been driven from Mosul or Raqqa is at best misleading.", "The DECISIVE STORM operation now seems to have moved against al-Qaeda, as well as Iran\u2019s instruments in Yemen, but how sustained that effort will be\u2014and how successful, given how powerful AQAP was allowed to become\u2014remains to be seen \u2013 by Kyle Orton", "https://kyleorton1991.wordpress.com/2016/05/10/yemen-and-al-qaedas-long-term-strategy/", "cp2 Allgemein / General", "11.5.2016 \u2013 Alwaght (A K P)", "Saudi Arabia to Perform Major Military Operation with Direct Support of US: Yemeni Commander", "A senior Yemeni Commander has reported that Saudi Regime is preparing for a major military operation with direct support of America.", "Mohamad Salman al-Salman, Yemeni commander, in a talk with Fars News Agency announced the preparation of Saudis for a major military operation with US direct backup.", "Considering the deployment of hundreds of American forces to Yemen\u2019s south, Mohamad Salman al-Salman said that the presence of US forces caused a surge in growth of terrorists and mercenary soldiers in regions adjacent to their Basement.", "Also on Monday Sadeq abu-Shwareb, the member of Yemen\u2019s Supreme Revolutionary Committee, stressed the Support of US for spreading terrorism in the region and in an interview with Alwaght said: \u201cthe US intervention in Yemen is not to confront Al-Qaeda; they have created Al-Qaeda and they have empowered it in some parts of Yemen\u2019s southern and eastern provinces, and I repeat that the reason is to cover up the scandal of the US as it backed the Saudi regime militarily and logistically and also by intelligence assistance.\u201d", "http://alwaght.com/en/News/53325", "cp3 Humanit\u00e4re Lage / Humanitarian situation", "12.5.2016 \u2013 ICRC (A H)", "Children can keep their childhood thanks to Red Crescent volunteers in Yemen", "Life has forever changed for Yemenis and non-Yemenis in the country, and for children, coping with the situation has been particularly difficult.

Moreover, those who presented a civilian ID were released and those who failed to present any ID or had a military/security IDs were sent out of the city to their home towns.  The raids targeted gatherings of daily workers who lived in garages, workshops and motels.

This caused them to panic and raid some areas, in order to expel anyone not in possession of a legitimate ID or proof of residence.", "While I am not a security expert, plain common sense is enough to see this is a bad move. And finally, the most important aspect of security, I believe, is public trust.

Moreover, condemnation on the part of the president and prime minister - both of whom are residents of Aden - of the conduct of Aden's governor and chief of security, sends a strong message that the two groups are not working together, an even more disturbing prospect than having Saleh's sleeping cells in the city \u2013 by Nadia al-Sakkaf", "https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2016/5/12/ethnic-hatred-in-yemen", "11.5.2016 \u2013 Almanar (* A K P)", "Y\u00e9men: Qui est derri\u00e8re l\u2019\u00e9puration ethnique et confessionnelle \u00e0 Aden ?", "L\u2019observatoire y\u00e9m\u00e9nite des droits de l\u2019Homme a condamn\u00e9 dans un communiqu\u00e9 officiel publi\u00e9 ce mercredi les pratiques des forces de l\u2019ordre y\u00e9m\u00e9nite alli\u00e9s \u00e0 la coalition, dont entre autres : le transfert forc\u00e9 des y\u00e9m\u00e9nites qui ne sont pas originaires d\u2019Aden vers les provinces de Taez et les autres villes du nord.", "\u00ab Des centaines de citoyens y\u00e9m\u00e9nites ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entass\u00e9s comme les animaux dans des bus et dans les coffres des camions \u00bb, s\u2019est indign\u00e9 le r\u00e9dacteur en chef du journal panarabe Rai al-Yom, Abdel Bari Atwan.", "\u00ab Le pr\u00e9texte avanc\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s proche la coalition c\u2019est que ces citoyens y\u00e9m\u00e9nites ne portent pas de carte d\u2019identit\u00e9.

Bush declared in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attack. To be more accurate, re-declared. The GWOT was declared by the Reagan administration when it took office, with fevered rhetoric about a \u201cplague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself\u201d (as Reagan put it) and a \u201creturn to barbarism in the modern age\u201d (the words of George Shultz, his secretary of state). The original GWOT has been quietly removed from history. It very quickly turned into a murderous and destructive terrorist war afflicting Central America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, with grim repercussions to the present, even leading to condemnation of the United States by the World Court (which Washington dismissed). In any event, it is not the right story for history, so it is gone.", "The success of the Bush-Obama version of GWOT can readily be evaluated on direct inspection. When the war was declared, the terrorist targets were confined to a small corner of tribal Afghanistan. They were protected by Afghans, who mostly disliked or despised them, under the tribal code of hospitality -- which baffled Americans when poor peasants refused \u201cto turn over Osama bin Laden for the, to them, astronomical sum of $25 million.\u201d", "There are good reasons to believe that a well-constructed police action, or even serious diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban, might have placed those suspected of the 9/11 crimes in American hands for trial and sentencing. But such options were off the table. Instead, the reflexive choice was large-scale violence -- not with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban (that came later) but to make clear U.S. contempt for tentative Taliban offers of the possible extradition of bin Laden. How serious these offers were we do not know, since the possibility of exploring them was never entertained. Or perhaps the United States was just intent on \u201ctrying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don\u2019t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose.\u201d", "That was the judgment of the highly respected anti-Taliban leader Abdul Haq, one of the many oppositionists who condemned the American bombing campaign launched in October 2001 as \"a big setback\" for their efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within, a goal they considered within their reach. His judgment is confirmed by Richard A. Clarke, who was chairman of the Counterterrorism Security Group at the White House under President George W. Bush when the plans to attack Afghanistan were made. As Clarke describes the meeting, when informed that the attack would violate international law, \"the President yelled in the narrow conference room, \u2018I don\u2019t care what the international lawyers say, we are going to kick some ass.'\" The attack was also bitterly opposed by the major aid organizations working in Afghanistan, who warned that millions were on the verge of starvation and that the consequences might be horrendous.", "The consequences for poor Afghanistan years later need hardly be reviewed.", "The next target of the sledgehammer was Iraq. The U.S.-UK invasion, utterly without credible pretext, is the major crime of the twenty-first century. The invasion led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people in a country where the civilian society had already been devastated by American and British sanctions that were regarded as \u201cgenocidal\u201d by the two distinguished international diplomats who administered them, and resigned in protest for this reason. The invasion also generated millions of refugees, largely destroyed the country, and instigated a sectarian conflict that is now tearing apart Iraq and the entire region. It is an astonishing fact about our intellectual and moral culture that in informed and enlightened circles it can be called, blandly, \u201cthe liberation of Iraq.\u201d", "Pentagon and British Ministry of Defense polls found that only 3% of Iraqis regarded the U.S. security role in their neighborhood as legitimate, less than 1% believed that \u201ccoalition\u201d (U.S.-UK) forces were good for their security, 80% opposed the presence of coalition forces in the country, and a majority supported attacks on coalition troops. Afghanistan has been destroyed beyond the possibility of reliable polling, but there are indications that something similar may be true there as well. Particularly in Iraq the United States suffered a severe defeat, abandoning its official war aims, and leaving the country under the influence of the sole victor, Iran.", "The sledgehammer was also wielded elsewhere, notably in Libya, where the three traditional imperial powers (Britain, France, and the United States) procured Security Council resolution 1973 and instantly violated it, becoming the air force of the rebels. The effect was to undercut the possibility of a peaceful, negotiated settlement; sharply increase casualties (by at least a factor of 10, according to political scientist Alan Kuperman); leave Libya in ruins, in the hands of warring militias; and, more recently, to provide the Islamic State with a base that it can use to spread terror beyond. Quite sensible diplomatic proposals by the African Union, accepted in principle by Libya\u2019s Muammar Qaddafi, were ignored by the imperial triumvirate, as Africa specialist Alex de Waal reviews. A huge flow of weapons and jihadis has spread terror and violence from West Africa (now the champion for terrorist murders) to the Levant, while the NATO attack also sent a flood of refugees from Africa to Europe.", "Yet another triumph of \u201chumanitarian intervention,\u201d and, as the long and often ghastly record reveals, not an unusual one, going back to its modern origins four centuries ago \u2013 by Noam Chomsky", "http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176137/", "10.5.2016 \u2013 Tom Dispatch (*** B K P T)", "Masters of Mankind: the Costs of Violence", "[This piece, the second of two parts, is excerpted from Noam Chomsky\u2019s new book, Who Rules the World?

Terrorism specialists Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank estimate that the Iraq War \u201cgenerated a stunning sevenfold increase in the yearly rate of fatal jihadist attacks, amounting to literally hundreds of additional terrorist attacks and thousands of civilian lives lost; even when terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan is excluded, fatal attacks in the rest of the world have increased by more than one-third.\u201d Other exercises have been similarly productive.", "More generally, studies carried out by the Oslo Peace Research Institute show that two-thirds of the region\u2019s conflict fatalities were produced in originally internal disputes where outsiders imposed their solutions. In such conflicts, 98% of fatalities were produced only after outsiders had entered the domestic dispute with their military might.", "The evidence reviewed by political scientist Timo Kivim\u00e4ki indicates that the \u201cprotection wars [fought by \u2018coalitions of the willing\u2019] have become the main source of violence in the world, occasionally contributing over 50% of total conflict fatalities.\u201d Furthermore, in many of these cases, including Syria, as he reviews, there were opportunities for diplomatic settlement that were ignored. That has also been true in other horrific situations, including the Balkans in the early 1990s, the first Gulf War, and of course the Indochina wars, the worst crime since World War II. In the case of Iraq the question does not even arise. There surely are some lessons here.", "The general consequences of resorting to the sledgehammer against vulnerable societies comes as little surprise.

The invaders \u2014 perhaps professing the most benign motives \u2014 are naturally disliked by the population, who disobey them, at first in small ways, eliciting a forceful response, which increases opposition and support for resistance. The cycle of violence escalates until the invaders withdraw \u2014 or gain their ends by something that may approach genocide.", "Obama\u2019s global drone assassination campaign, a remarkable innovation in global terrorism, exhibits the same patterns.

We can look at Iraq, we can look at Afghanistan, we can look at the situation in Libya and also the situation in Syria, and of course in Yemen. The US some 14 months ago withdrew special forces; they evacuated their embassy in Yemen.

If you look at the alliances that were formed against the advances of the Houthi, [they] have nothing to do with the fight against Al-Qaeda.

But mostly people who have been killed were not the Al-Qaeda operatives \u2013 many of them were innocent civilians, or people who could not be directly linked to Al-Qaeda. What we have in Yemen is a representation of a failed US policy throughout the region. It\u2019s absurd for Peter Cook, the spokesperson for the Pentagon, to even suggest that this redeployment of US forces has anything to do with fighting Al-Qaeda. Their main objectives there are to prevent and contain the influence of Iran. This ties in with their foreign policy in Syria, where they\u2019ve backed these extremist organizations which have caused tremendous death and destruction in Syria, and of course they are reentering Iraq.

This ends a year of occupation and brings to a close what is effectively the third emirate or statelet AQAP has either set up or attempted to set up in Yemen since 2011. These projects offer some insights into al-Qaeda\u2019s methodology in getting to an Islamic state, including its rebranding in opposition to the Islamic State (IS).", "Bin Ladin\u2019s ancestral homeland is in Hadramut in southern Yemen and he had tried to foment Islamist revolution there since 1989-90. Al-Qaeda\u2019s first terrorist attack against America took place in Yemen on 29 December 1992, with the bombings in Aden of the Gold Mohur Hotel and the Aden M\u00f6venpick Hotel targeting American Marines\u2014who were on their way to Somalia to help alleviate the suffering of a (Muslim) population afflicted by famine and war. Much to Bin Ladin\u2019s disappointment, the Yemeni population bought into Yemeni unification and the tribal and patronage networks of the new system. With the hopes of an Islamist statelet in Yemen dashed, al-Qaeda nonetheless maintained Yemen connections as a throughway and fundraiser.", "Picking through the wreckage after al-Qaeda\u2019s attempts at state-management had ended in catastrophe in Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, and Mali, the change of direction Bin Ladin had been advocating in his final days now took hold among his subordinates. Al-Wuhayshi, al-Qaeda\u2019s general manager as well as AQAP\u2019s leader, understood that the project in Yemen had gone wrong. On 21 May 2012, weeks before AQAP was ejected from Ja\u2019ar and its statelet disbanded, al-Wuhayshi wrote to Abdelmalik Droukdel (Abu Musab Abdul Wadud), the leader of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which had invaded northern Mali in January 2012 and received an enormous boost after the military overthrew the government in March, leaving Bamako a shambles as the jihadists dug in. Still, al-Wuhayshi sensed danger, warning AQIM of the need to \u201ckeep the [media] message under control,\u201d and cautioning that AQAP had learned lessons from its mistakes that had now united tribes, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Salafists against them.", "The themes of al-Qaeda\u2019s new model were sharpening into view: Muslim societies had been stripped of real religious understanding (the notion of Sayyid Qutb that this was a new age of jahiliya, ignorance and paganism) and therefore had to be led gradually back into it; applying the full shari\u2019a immediately would lead to a rejection of the jihadists and their ideas, not least because so many enemies were waiting for the jihadists to falter in order to take advantage and extinguish the true Islam; and the key to success was to make the population and al-Qaeda co-dependent\u2014al-Qaeda would solve the population\u2019s most pressing needs (whether that was fighting the government or social services) so that population felt its interests were coterminous with al-Qaeda\u2019s and would protect the group, providing a bodyguard and durable roots for al-Qaeda\u2019s global agenda.", "These lessons had been assimilated when AQAP overran al-Mukalla on 3 April 2015, capturing large amounts of American-supplied equipment, the day after AQAP had systematically seized key facilities, including Hadramut Province\u2019s security headquarters, the local police station, provincial administrative offices, a branch of the central bank, and the Central Prison, breaking free more than three-hundred people, including Khaled al-Batarfi, an AQAP military operations chief for Abyan and Baydah Provinces when he was captured in March 2011. This time, AQAP would \u201cpose as a local protector-savior rather than an overlord in Mukalla,\u201d as Yemen researcher Elisabeth Kendall noted. AQAP\u2019s ideology was not widely shared in the areas it captured, but the creation of a pseudo-state where \u201ceven its detractors grudgingly acknowledged that AQAP was approachable, had some sense of justice and got things done,\u201d meant AQAP \u201csucceed in building tolerance for [its presence], if not outright support,\u201d Kendall adds.", "AQAP\u2019s capture of al-Mukalla came just over a week after a Saudi-led coalition launched Operation DECISIVE STORM on 25 March 2015, which was designed to push back the Houthis and restore the political process. With other priorities, the Saudi-led forces had, until April 2016, essentially ignored AQAP and AQAP had kept very quiet about its holdings, not claiming any kind of state or emirate, and worked to embed itself within the wider insurgent movement in Yemen. AQAP is not as powerful as al-Qaeda\u2019s Syrian branch, Jabhat al-Nusra, the self-conscious culmination of al-Qaeda\u2019s refinement to its model of durable governance, but AQAP has made itself virtually indistinguishable from large sections of the Yemeni insurgency.", "Moreover, when AQAP was removed from al-Mukalla on 24 April 2016, it is more precise to say it removed itself. There was a major ground operation of more than 2,000 foreign troops and local forces led by the United Arab Emirates into al-Mukalla, but while the Coalition claimed that 800 AQAP jihadists had been killed, the real figure is probably closer to sixty. AQAP itself said that it had withdrawn\u2014ostensibly to protect civilians\u2014rather than having been routed. In short, after a year of controlling the city, embedding itself into social networks, proselytizing, collecting taxes, looting arms munitions and banks, AQAP pulled out of al-Mukalla and lived to fight another day. Thus, the suggestion this is as big a victory as if IS had been driven from Mosul or Raqqa is at best misleading.", "The DECISIVE STORM operation now seems to have moved against al-Qaeda, as well as Iran\u2019s instruments in Yemen, but how sustained that effort will be\u2014and how successful, given how powerful AQAP was allowed to become\u2014remains to be seen \u2013 by Kyle Orton", "https://kyleorton1991.wordpress.com/2016/05/10/yemen-and-al-qaedas-long-term-strategy/", "cp2 Allgemein / General", "11.5.2016 \u2013 Alwaght (A K P)", "Saudi Arabia to Perform Major Military Operation with Direct Support of US: Yemeni Commander", "A senior Yemeni Commander has reported that Saudi Regime is preparing for a major military operation with direct support of America.", "Mohamad Salman al-Salman, Yemeni commander, in a talk with Fars News Agency announced the preparation of Saudis for a major military operation with US direct backup.", "Considering the deployment of hundreds of American forces to Yemen\u2019s south, Mohamad Salman al-Salman said that the presence of US forces caused a surge in growth of terrorists and mercenary soldiers in regions adjacent to their Basement.", "Also on Monday Sadeq abu-Shwareb, the member of Yemen\u2019s Supreme Revolutionary Committee, stressed the Support of US for spreading terrorism in the region and in an interview with Alwaght said: \u201cthe US intervention in Yemen is not to confront Al-Qaeda; they have created Al-Qaeda and they have empowered it in some parts of Yemen\u2019s southern and eastern provinces, and I repeat that the reason is to cover up the scandal of the US as it backed the Saudi regime militarily and logistically and also by intelligence assistance.\u201d", "http://alwaght.com/en/News/53325", "cp3 Humanit\u00e4re Lage / Humanitarian situation", "12.5.2016 \u2013 ICRC (A H)", "Children can keep their childhood thanks to Red Crescent volunteers in Yemen", "Life has forever changed for Yemenis and non-Yemenis in the country, and for children, coping with the situation has been particularly difficult.

Bush declared in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attack. To be more accurate, re-declared. The GWOT was declared by the Reagan administration when it took office, with fevered rhetoric about a \u201cplague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself\u201d (as Reagan put it) and a \u201creturn to barbarism in the modern age\u201d (the words of George Shultz, his secretary of state). The original GWOT has been quietly removed from history. It very quickly turned into a murderous and destructive terrorist war afflicting Central America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, with grim repercussions to the present, even leading to condemnation of the United States by the World Court (which Washington dismissed). In any event, it is not the right story for history, so it is gone.", "The success of the Bush-Obama version of GWOT can readily be evaluated on direct inspection. When the war was declared, the terrorist targets were confined to a small corner of tribal Afghanistan. They were protected by Afghans, who mostly disliked or despised them, under the tribal code of hospitality -- which baffled Americans when poor peasants refused \u201cto turn over Osama bin Laden for the, to them, astronomical sum of $25 million.\u201d", "There are good reasons to believe that a well-constructed police action, or even serious diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban, might have placed those suspected of the 9/11 crimes in American hands for trial and sentencing. But such options were off the table. Instead, the reflexive choice was large-scale violence -- not with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban (that came later) but to make clear U.S. contempt for tentative Taliban offers of the possible extradition of bin Laden. How serious these offers were we do not know, since the possibility of exploring them was never entertained. Or perhaps the United States was just intent on \u201ctrying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don\u2019t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose.\u201d", "That was the judgment of the highly respected anti-Taliban leader Abdul Haq, one of the many oppositionists who condemned the American bombing campaign launched in October 2001 as \"a big setback\" for their efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within, a goal they considered within their reach. His judgment is confirmed by Richard A. Clarke, who was chairman of the Counterterrorism Security Group at the White House under President George W. Bush when the plans to attack Afghanistan were made. As Clarke describes the meeting, when informed that the attack would violate international law, \"the President yelled in the narrow conference room, \u2018I don\u2019t care what the international lawyers say, we are going to kick some ass.'\" The attack was also bitterly opposed by the major aid organizations working in Afghanistan, who warned that millions were on the verge of starvation and that the consequences might be horrendous.", "The consequences for poor Afghanistan years later need hardly be reviewed.", "The next target of the sledgehammer was Iraq. The U.S.-UK invasion, utterly without credible pretext, is the major crime of the twenty-first century. The invasion led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people in a country where the civilian society had already been devastated by American and British sanctions that were regarded as \u201cgenocidal\u201d by the two distinguished international diplomats who administered them, and resigned in protest for this reason. The invasion also generated millions of refugees, largely destroyed the country, and instigated a sectarian conflict that is now tearing apart Iraq and the entire region. It is an astonishing fact about our intellectual and moral culture that in informed and enlightened circles it can be called, blandly, \u201cthe liberation of Iraq.\u201d", "Pentagon and British Ministry of Defense polls found that only 3% of Iraqis regarded the U.S. security role in their neighborhood as legitimate, less than 1% believed that \u201ccoalition\u201d (U.S.-UK) forces were good for their security, 80% opposed the presence of coalition forces in the country, and a majority supported attacks on coalition troops. Afghanistan has been destroyed beyond the possibility of reliable polling, but there are indications that something similar may be true there as well. Particularly in Iraq the United States suffered a severe defeat, abandoning its official war aims, and leaving the country under the influence of the sole victor, Iran.", "The sledgehammer was also wielded elsewhere, notably in Libya, where the three traditional imperial powers (Britain, France, and the United States) procured Security Council resolution 1973 and instantly violated it, becoming the air force of the rebels. The effect was to undercut the possibility of a peaceful, negotiated settlement; sharply increase casualties (by at least a factor of 10, according to political scientist Alan Kuperman); leave Libya in ruins, in the hands of warring militias; and, more recently, to provide the Islamic State with a base that it can use to spread terror beyond. Quite sensible diplomatic proposals by the African Union, accepted in principle by Libya\u2019s Muammar Qaddafi, were ignored by the imperial triumvirate, as Africa specialist Alex de Waal reviews. A huge flow of weapons and jihadis has spread terror and violence from West Africa (now the champion for terrorist murders) to the Levant, while the NATO attack also sent a flood of refugees from Africa to Europe.", "Yet another triumph of \u201chumanitarian intervention,\u201d and, as the long and often ghastly record reveals, not an unusual one, going back to its modern origins four centuries ago \u2013 by Noam Chomsky", "http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176137/", "10.5.2016 \u2013 Tom Dispatch (*** B K P T)", "Masters of Mankind: the Costs of Violence", "[This piece, the second of two parts, is excerpted from Noam Chomsky\u2019s new book, Who Rules the World?

Part 1 can be found by clicking here.]", "In brief, the Global War on Terror sledgehammer strategy has spread jihadi terror from a tiny corner of Afghanistan to much of the world, from Africa through the Levant and South Asia to Southeast Asia. It has also incited attacks in Europe and the United States. The invasion of Iraq made a substantial contribution to this process, much as intelligence agencies had predicted. Terrorism specialists Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank estimate that the Iraq War \u201cgenerated a stunning sevenfold increase in the yearly rate of fatal jihadist attacks, amounting to literally hundreds of additional terrorist attacks and thousands of civilian lives lost; even when terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan is excluded, fatal attacks in the rest of the world have increased by more than one-third.\u201d Other exercises have been similarly productive.", "More generally, studies carried out by the Oslo Peace Research Institute show that two-thirds of the region\u2019s conflict fatalities were produced in originally internal disputes where outsiders imposed their solutions. In such conflicts, 98% of fatalities were produced only after outsiders had entered the domestic dispute with their military might.", "The evidence reviewed by political scientist Timo Kivim\u00e4ki indicates that the \u201cprotection wars [fought by \u2018coalitions of the willing\u2019] have become the main source of violence in the world, occasionally contributing over 50% of total conflict fatalities.\u201d Furthermore, in many of these cases, including Syria, as he reviews, there were opportunities for diplomatic settlement that were ignored. That has also been true in other horrific situations, including the Balkans in the early 1990s, the first Gulf War, and of course the Indochina wars, the worst crime since World War II. In the case of Iraq the question does not even arise. There surely are some lessons here.", "The general consequences of resorting to the sledgehammer against vulnerable societies comes as little surprise. William Polk\u2019s careful study of insurgencies, Violent Politics, should be essential reading for those who want to understand today\u2019s conflicts.", "Polk reveals a pattern that has been replicated over and over. The invaders \u2014 perhaps professing the most benign motives \u2014 are naturally disliked by the population, who disobey them, at first in small ways, eliciting a forceful response, which increases opposition and support for resistance. The cycle of violence escalates until the invaders withdraw \u2014 or gain their ends by something that may approach genocide.", "Obama\u2019s global drone assassination campaign, a remarkable innovation in global terrorism, exhibits the same patterns. By most accounts, it is generating terrorists more rapidly than it is murdering those suspected of someday intending to harm us.", "Another characteristic feature of such interventions is the belief that the insurgency will be overcome by eliminating its leaders. But when such an effort succeeds, the reviled leader is regularly replaced by someone younger, more determined, more brutal, and more effective.", "Careful studies of al-Qaeda and ISIS have shown that the United States and its allies are following their game plan with some precision. Their goal is to \u201cdraw the West as deeply and actively as possible into the quagmire\u201d and \u201cto perpetually engage and enervate the United States and the West in a series of prolonged overseas ventures\u201d in which they will undermine their own societies, expend their resources, and increase the level of violence, setting off the dynamic that Polk reviews.", "And if we continue to wield the sledgehammer, tacitly following the jihadi script, the likely effect is even more violent jihadism with broader appeal. The record, Atran advises, \u201cshould inspire a radical change in our counter-strategies.\u201d", "Repeated Western interventions since then in the Middle East and Africa have exacerbated the tensions, conflicts, and disruptions that have shattered the societies.

We can look at Iraq, we can look at Afghanistan, we can look at the situation in Libya and also the situation in Syria, and of course in Yemen. The US some 14 months ago withdrew special forces; they evacuated their embassy in Yemen.

If you look at the alliances that were formed against the advances of the Houthi, [they] have nothing to do with the fight against Al-Qaeda.

But mostly people who have been killed were not the Al-Qaeda operatives \u2013 many of them were innocent civilians, or people who could not be directly linked to Al-Qaeda. What we have in Yemen is a representation of a failed US policy throughout the region. It\u2019s absurd for Peter Cook, the spokesperson for the Pentagon, to even suggest that this redeployment of US forces has anything to do with fighting Al-Qaeda. Their main objectives there are to prevent and contain the influence of Iran. This ties in with their foreign policy in Syria, where they\u2019ve backed these extremist organizations which have caused tremendous death and destruction in Syria, and of course they are reentering Iraq.

This ends a year of occupation and brings to a close what is effectively the third emirate or statelet AQAP has either set up or attempted to set up in Yemen since 2011. These projects offer some insights into al-Qaeda\u2019s methodology in getting to an Islamic state, including its rebranding in opposition to the Islamic State (IS).", "Bin Ladin\u2019s ancestral homeland is in Hadramut in southern Yemen and he had tried to foment Islamist revolution there since 1989-90. Al-Qaeda\u2019s first terrorist attack against America took place in Yemen on 29 December 1992, with the bombings in Aden of the Gold Mohur Hotel and the Aden M\u00f6venpick Hotel targeting American Marines\u2014who were on their way to Somalia to help alleviate the suffering of a (Muslim) population afflicted by famine and war. Much to Bin Ladin\u2019s disappointment, the Yemeni population bought into Yemeni unification and the tribal and patronage networks of the new system. With the hopes of an Islamist statelet in Yemen dashed, al-Qaeda nonetheless maintained Yemen connections as a throughway and fundraiser.", "Picking through the wreckage after al-Qaeda\u2019s attempts at state-management had ended in catastrophe in Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, and Mali, the change of direction Bin Ladin had been advocating in his final days now took hold among his subordinates. Al-Wuhayshi, al-Qaeda\u2019s general manager as well as AQAP\u2019s leader, understood that the project in Yemen had gone wrong. On 21 May 2012, weeks before AQAP was ejected from Ja\u2019ar and its statelet disbanded, al-Wuhayshi wrote to Abdelmalik Droukdel (Abu Musab Abdul Wadud), the leader of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which had invaded northern Mali in January 2012 and received an enormous boost after the military overthrew the government in March, leaving Bamako a shambles as the jihadists dug in. Still, al-Wuhayshi sensed danger, warning AQIM of the need to \u201ckeep the [media] message under control,\u201d and cautioning that AQAP had learned lessons from its mistakes that had now united tribes, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Salafists against them.", "The themes of al-Qaeda\u2019s new model were sharpening into view: Muslim societies had been stripped of real religious understanding (the notion of Sayyid Qutb that this was a new age of jahiliya, ignorance and paganism) and therefore had to be led gradually back into it; applying the full shari\u2019a immediately would lead to a rejection of the jihadists and their ideas, not least because so many enemies were waiting for the jihadists to falter in order to take advantage and extinguish the true Islam; and the key to success was to make the population and al-Qaeda co-dependent\u2014al-Qaeda would solve the population\u2019s most pressing needs (whether that was fighting the government or social services) so that population felt its interests were coterminous with al-Qaeda\u2019s and would protect the group, providing a bodyguard and durable roots for al-Qaeda\u2019s global agenda.", "These lessons had been assimilated when AQAP overran al-Mukalla on 3 April 2015, capturing large amounts of American-supplied equipment, the day after AQAP had systematically seized key facilities, including Hadramut Province\u2019s security headquarters, the local police station, provincial administrative offices, a branch of the central bank, and the Central Prison, breaking free more than three-hundred people, including Khaled al-Batarfi, an AQAP military operations chief for Abyan and Baydah Provinces when he was captured in March 2011. This time, AQAP would \u201cpose as a local protector-savior rather than an overlord in Mukalla,\u201d as Yemen researcher Elisabeth Kendall noted. AQAP\u2019s ideology was not widely shared in the areas it captured, but the creation of a pseudo-state where \u201ceven its detractors grudgingly acknowledged that AQAP was approachable, had some sense of justice and got things done,\u201d meant AQAP \u201csucceed in building tolerance for [its presence], if not outright support,\u201d Kendall adds.", "AQAP\u2019s capture of al-Mukalla came just over a week after a Saudi-led coalition launched Operation DECISIVE STORM on 25 March 2015, which was designed to push back the Houthis and restore the political process. With other priorities, the Saudi-led forces had, until April 2016, essentially ignored AQAP and AQAP had kept very quiet about its holdings, not claiming any kind of state or emirate, and worked to embed itself within the wider insurgent movement in Yemen. AQAP is not as powerful as al-Qaeda\u2019s Syrian branch, Jabhat al-Nusra, the self-conscious culmination of al-Qaeda\u2019s refinement to its model of durable governance, but AQAP has made itself virtually indistinguishable from large sections of the Yemeni insurgency.", "Moreover, when AQAP was removed from al-Mukalla on 24 April 2016, it is more precise to say it removed itself. There was a major ground operation of more than 2,000 foreign troops and local forces led by the United Arab Emirates into al-Mukalla, but while the Coalition claimed that 800 AQAP jihadists had been killed, the real figure is probably closer to sixty. AQAP itself said that it had withdrawn\u2014ostensibly to protect civilians\u2014rather than having been routed. In short, after a year of controlling the city, embedding itself into social networks, proselytizing, collecting taxes, looting arms munitions and banks, AQAP pulled out of al-Mukalla and lived to fight another day. Thus, the suggestion this is as big a victory as if IS had been driven from Mosul or Raqqa is at best misleading.", "The DECISIVE STORM operation now seems to have moved against al-Qaeda, as well as Iran\u2019s instruments in Yemen, but how sustained that effort will be\u2014and how successful, given how powerful AQAP was allowed to become\u2014remains to be seen \u2013 by Kyle Orton", "https://kyleorton1991.wordpress.com/2016/05/10/yemen-and-al-qaedas-long-term-strategy/", "cp2 Allgemein / General", "11.5.2016 \u2013 Alwaght (A K P)", "Saudi Arabia to Perform Major Military Operation with Direct Support of US: Yemeni Commander", "A senior Yemeni Commander has reported that Saudi Regime is preparing for a major military operation with direct support of America.", "Mohamad Salman al-Salman, Yemeni commander, in a talk with Fars News Agency announced the preparation of Saudis for a major military operation with US direct backup.", "Considering the deployment of hundreds of American forces to Yemen\u2019s south, Mohamad Salman al-Salman said that the presence of US forces caused a surge in growth of terrorists and mercenary soldiers in regions adjacent to their Basement.", "Also on Monday Sadeq abu-Shwareb, the member of Yemen\u2019s Supreme Revolutionary Committee, stressed the Support of US for spreading terrorism in the region and in an interview with Alwaght said: \u201cthe US intervention in Yemen is not to confront Al-Qaeda; they have created Al-Qaeda and they have empowered it in some parts of Yemen\u2019s southern and eastern provinces, and I repeat that the reason is to cover up the scandal of the US as it backed the Saudi regime militarily and logistically and also by intelligence assistance.\u201d", "http://alwaght.com/en/News/53325", "cp3 Humanit\u00e4re Lage / Humanitarian situation", "12.5.2016 \u2013 ICRC (A H)", "Children can keep their childhood thanks to Red Crescent volunteers in Yemen", "Life has forever changed for Yemenis and non-Yemenis in the country, and for children, coping with the situation has been particularly difficult.

Bush declared in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attack. To be more accurate, re-declared. The GWOT was declared by the Reagan administration when it took office, with fevered rhetoric about a \u201cplague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself\u201d (as Reagan put it) and a \u201creturn to barbarism in the modern age\u201d (the words of George Shultz, his secretary of state). The original GWOT has been quietly removed from history. It very quickly turned into a murderous and destructive terrorist war afflicting Central America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, with grim repercussions to the present, even leading to condemnation of the United States by the World Court (which Washington dismissed). In any event, it is not the right story for history, so it is gone.", "The success of the Bush-Obama version of GWOT can readily be evaluated on direct inspection. When the war was declared, the terrorist targets were confined to a small corner of tribal Afghanistan. They were protected by Afghans, who mostly disliked or despised them, under the tribal code of hospitality -- which baffled Americans when poor peasants refused \u201cto turn over Osama bin Laden for the, to them, astronomical sum of $25 million.\u201d", "There are good reasons to believe that a well-constructed police action, or even serious diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban, might have placed those suspected of the 9/11 crimes in American hands for trial and sentencing. But such options were off the table. Instead, the reflexive choice was large-scale violence -- not with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban (that came later) but to make clear U.S. contempt for tentative Taliban offers of the possible extradition of bin Laden. How serious these offers were we do not know, since the possibility of exploring them was never entertained. Or perhaps the United States was just intent on \u201ctrying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don\u2019t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose.\u201d", "That was the judgment of the highly respected anti-Taliban leader Abdul Haq, one of the many oppositionists who condemned the American bombing campaign launched in October 2001 as \"a big setback\" for their efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within, a goal they considered within their reach. His judgment is confirmed by Richard A. Clarke, who was chairman of the Counterterrorism Security Group at the White House under President George W. Bush when the plans to attack Afghanistan were made. As Clarke describes the meeting, when informed that the attack would violate international law, \"the President yelled in the narrow conference room, \u2018I don\u2019t care what the international lawyers say, we are going to kick some ass.'\" The attack was also bitterly opposed by the major aid organizations working in Afghanistan, who warned that millions were on the verge of starvation and that the consequences might be horrendous.", "The consequences for poor Afghanistan years later need hardly be reviewed.", "The next target of the sledgehammer was Iraq. The U.S.-UK invasion, utterly without credible pretext, is the major crime of the twenty-first century. The invasion led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people in a country where the civilian society had already been devastated by American and British sanctions that were regarded as \u201cgenocidal\u201d by the two distinguished international diplomats who administered them, and resigned in protest for this reason. The invasion also generated millions of refugees, largely destroyed the country, and instigated a sectarian conflict that is now tearing apart Iraq and the entire region. It is an astonishing fact about our intellectual and moral culture that in informed and enlightened circles it can be called, blandly, \u201cthe liberation of Iraq.\u201d", "Pentagon and British Ministry of Defense polls found that only 3% of Iraqis regarded the U.S. security role in their neighborhood as legitimate, less than 1% believed that \u201ccoalition\u201d (U.S.-UK) forces were good for their security, 80% opposed the presence of coalition forces in the country, and a majority supported attacks on coalition troops. Afghanistan has been destroyed beyond the possibility of reliable polling, but there are indications that something similar may be true there as well. Particularly in Iraq the United States suffered a severe defeat, abandoning its official war aims, and leaving the country under the influence of the sole victor, Iran.", "The sledgehammer was also wielded elsewhere, notably in Libya, where the three traditional imperial powers (Britain, France, and the United States) procured Security Council resolution 1973 and instantly violated it, becoming the air force of the rebels. The effect was to undercut the possibility of a peaceful, negotiated settlement; sharply increase casualties (by at least a factor of 10, according to political scientist Alan Kuperman); leave Libya in ruins, in the hands of warring militias; and, more recently, to provide the Islamic State with a base that it can use to spread terror beyond. Quite sensible diplomatic proposals by the African Union, accepted in principle by Libya\u2019s Muammar Qaddafi, were ignored by the imperial triumvirate, as Africa specialist Alex de Waal reviews. A huge flow of weapons and jihadis has spread terror and violence from West Africa (now the champion for terrorist murders) to the Levant, while the NATO attack also sent a flood of refugees from Africa to Europe.", "Yet another triumph of \u201chumanitarian intervention,\u201d and, as the long and often ghastly record reveals, not an unusual one, going back to its modern origins four centuries ago \u2013 by Noam Chomsky", "http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176137/", "10.5.2016 \u2013 Tom Dispatch (*** B K P T)", "Masters of Mankind: the Costs of Violence", "[This piece, the second of two parts, is excerpted from Noam Chomsky\u2019s new book, Who Rules the World?

It has also incited attacks in Europe and the United States. The invasion of Iraq made a substantial contribution to this process, much as intelligence agencies had predicted. Terrorism specialists Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank estimate that the Iraq War \u201cgenerated a stunning sevenfold increase in the yearly rate of fatal jihadist attacks, amounting to literally hundreds of additional terrorist attacks and thousands of civilian lives lost; even when terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan is excluded, fatal attacks in the rest of the world have increased by more than one-third.\u201d Other exercises have been similarly productive.", "More generally, studies carried out by the Oslo Peace Research Institute show that two-thirds of the region\u2019s conflict fatalities were produced in originally internal disputes where outsiders imposed their solutions. In such conflicts, 98% of fatalities were produced only after outsiders had entered the domestic dispute with their military might.", "The evidence reviewed by political scientist Timo Kivim\u00e4ki indicates that the \u201cprotection wars [fought by \u2018coalitions of the willing\u2019] have become the main source of violence in the world, occasionally contributing over 50% of total conflict fatalities.\u201d Furthermore, in many of these cases, including Syria, as he reviews, there were opportunities for diplomatic settlement that were ignored. That has also been true in other horrific situations, including the Balkans in the early 1990s, the first Gulf War, and of course the Indochina wars, the worst crime since World War II. In the case of Iraq the question does not even arise. There surely are some lessons here.", "The general consequences of resorting to the sledgehammer against vulnerable societies comes as little surprise. William Polk\u2019s careful study of insurgencies, Violent Politics, should be essential reading for those who want to understand today\u2019s conflicts.", "Polk reveals a pattern that has been replicated over and over. The invaders \u2014 perhaps professing the most benign motives \u2014 are naturally disliked by the population, who disobey them, at first in small ways, eliciting a forceful response, which increases opposition and support for resistance. The cycle of violence escalates until the invaders withdraw \u2014 or gain their ends by something that may approach genocide.", "Obama\u2019s global drone assassination campaign, a remarkable innovation in global terrorism, exhibits the same patterns. By most accounts, it is generating terrorists more rapidly than it is murdering those suspected of someday intending to harm us.", "Another characteristic feature of such interventions is the belief that the insurgency will be overcome by eliminating its leaders. But when such an effort succeeds, the reviled leader is regularly replaced by someone younger, more determined, more brutal, and more effective.", "Careful studies of al-Qaeda and ISIS have shown that the United States and its allies are following their game plan with some precision. Their goal is to \u201cdraw the West as deeply and actively as possible into the quagmire\u201d and \u201cto perpetually engage and enervate the United States and the West in a series of prolonged overseas ventures\u201d in which they will undermine their own societies, expend their resources, and increase the level of violence, setting off the dynamic that Polk reviews.", "And if we continue to wield the sledgehammer, tacitly following the jihadi script, the likely effect is even more violent jihadism with broader appeal. The record, Atran advises, \u201cshould inspire a radical change in our counter-strategies.\u201d", "Repeated Western interventions since then in the Middle East and Africa have exacerbated the tensions, conflicts, and disruptions that have shattered the societies.

What we have in Yemen is a representation of a failed US policy throughout the region. It\u2019s absurd for Peter Cook, the spokesperson for the Pentagon, to even suggest that this redeployment of US forces has anything to do with fighting Al-Qaeda. Their main objectives there are to prevent and contain the influence of Iran. This ties in with their foreign policy in Syria, where they\u2019ve backed these extremist organizations which have caused tremendous death and destruction in Syria, and of course they are reentering Iraq.

The results were fatal sometimes. I remember receiving some children who had chest infections, which spread to the brain to become meningitis.

This ends a year of occupation and brings to a close what is effectively the third emirate or statelet AQAP has either set up or attempted to set up in Yemen since 2011.

On 21 May 2012, weeks before AQAP was ejected from Ja\u2019ar and its statelet disbanded, al-Wuhayshi wrote to Abdelmalik Droukdel (Abu Musab Abdul Wadud), the leader of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which had invaded northern Mali in January 2012 and received an enormous boost after the military overthrew the government in March, leaving Bamako a shambles as the jihadists dug in. Still, al-Wuhayshi sensed danger, warning AQIM of the need to \u201ckeep the [media] message under control,\u201d and cautioning that AQAP had learned lessons from its mistakes that had now united tribes, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Salafists against them.", "The themes of al-Qaeda\u2019s new model were sharpening into view: Muslim societies had been stripped of real religious understanding (the notion of Sayyid Qutb that this was a new age of jahiliya, ignorance and paganism) and therefore had to be led gradually back into it; applying the full shari\u2019a immediately would lead to a rejection of the jihadists and their ideas, not least because so many enemies were waiting for the jihadists to falter in order to take advantage and extinguish the true Islam; and the key to success was to make the population and al-Qaeda co-dependent\u2014al-Qaeda would solve the population\u2019s most pressing needs (whether that was fighting the government or social services) so that population felt its interests were coterminous with al-Qaeda\u2019s and would protect the group, providing a bodyguard and durable roots for al-Qaeda\u2019s global agenda.", "These lessons had been assimilated when AQAP overran al-Mukalla on 3 April 2015, capturing large amounts of American-supplied equipment, the day after AQAP had systematically seized key facilities, including Hadramut Province\u2019s security headquarters, the local police station, provincial administrative offices, a branch of the central bank, and the Central Prison, breaking free more than three-hundred people, including Khaled al-Batarfi, an AQAP military operations chief for Abyan and Baydah Provinces when he was captured in March 2011. This time, AQAP would \u201cpose as a local protector-savior rather than an overlord in Mukalla,\u201d as Yemen researcher Elisabeth Kendall noted. AQAP\u2019s ideology was not widely shared in the areas it captured, but the creation of a pseudo-state where \u201ceven its detractors grudgingly acknowledged that AQAP was approachable, had some sense of justice and got things done,\u201d meant AQAP \u201csucceed in building tolerance for [its presence], if not outright support,\u201d Kendall adds.", "AQAP\u2019s capture of al-Mukalla came just over a week after a Saudi-led coalition launched Operation DECISIVE STORM on 25 March 2015, which was designed to push back the Houthis and restore the political process. With other priorities, the Saudi-led forces had, until April 2016, essentially ignored AQAP and AQAP had kept very quiet about its holdings, not claiming any kind of state or emirate, and worked to embed itself within the wider insurgent movement in Yemen. AQAP is not as powerful as al-Qaeda\u2019s Syrian branch, Jabhat al-Nusra, the self-conscious culmination of al-Qaeda\u2019s refinement to its model of durable governance, but AQAP has made itself virtually indistinguishable from large sections of the Yemeni insurgency.", "Moreover, when AQAP was removed from al-Mukalla on 24 April 2016, it is more precise to say it removed itself. There was a major ground operation of more than 2,000 foreign troops and local forces led by the United Arab Emirates into al-Mukalla, but while the Coalition claimed that 800 AQAP jihadists had been killed, the real figure is probably closer to sixty. AQAP itself said that it had withdrawn\u2014ostensibly to protect civilians\u2014rather than having been routed. In short, after a year of controlling the city, embedding itself into social networks, proselytizing, collecting taxes, looting arms munitions and banks, AQAP pulled out of al-Mukalla and lived to fight another day. Thus, the suggestion this is as big a victory as if IS had been driven from Mosul or Raqqa is at best misleading.", "The DECISIVE STORM operation now seems to have moved against al-Qaeda, as well as Iran\u2019s instruments in Yemen, but how sustained that effort will be\u2014and how successful, given how powerful AQAP was allowed to become\u2014remains to be seen \u2013 by Kyle Orton", "https://kyleorton1991.wordpress.com/2016/05/10/yemen-and-al-qaedas-long-term-strategy/", "cp2 Allgemein / General", "11.5.2016 \u2013 Alwaght (A K P)", "Saudi Arabia to Perform Major Military Operation with Direct Support of US: Yemeni Commander", "A senior Yemeni Commander has reported that Saudi Regime is preparing for a major military operation with direct support of America.", "Mohamad Salman al-Salman, Yemeni commander, in a talk with Fars News Agency announced the preparation of Saudis for a major military operation with US direct backup.", "Considering the deployment of hundreds of American forces to Yemen\u2019s south, Mohamad Salman al-Salman said that the presence of US forces caused a surge in growth of terrorists and mercenary soldiers in regions adjacent to their Basement.", "Also on Monday Sadeq abu-Shwareb, the member of Yemen\u2019s Supreme Revolutionary Committee, stressed the Support of US for spreading terrorism in the region and in an interview with Alwaght said: \u201cthe US intervention in Yemen is not to confront Al-Qaeda; they have created Al-Qaeda and they have empowered it in some parts of Yemen\u2019s southern and eastern provinces, and I repeat that the reason is to cover up the scandal of the US as it backed the Saudi regime militarily and logistically and also by intelligence assistance.\u201d", "http://alwaght.com/en/News/53325", "cp3 Humanit\u00e4re Lage / Humanitarian situation", "12.5.2016 \u2013 ICRC (A H)", "Children can keep their childhood thanks to Red Crescent volunteers in Yemen", "Life has forever changed for Yemenis and non-Yemenis in the country, and for children, coping with the situation has been particularly difficult.

In response, the Saudi- and Emirati-led Gulf coalition fighting on the government's side has been redirecting a significant portion of its military efforts toward the emergent AQAP enclave in the south, especially since the campaign to retake the capital from other rebel forces became bogged down by protracted peace talks.
