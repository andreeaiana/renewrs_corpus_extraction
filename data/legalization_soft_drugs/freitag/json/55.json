This approach came against a backdrop of escalation on the ground against our people, as evident by the attacks against South Yemen at the start of August. As we stated clearly from the beginning, the solution to the crisis was and remains a political one. This is why the STC took all necessary measures to ensure the protection of civilians in the South, restore security and stability in Aden, and intensify our diplomatic efforts to bring about a sustainable and long lasting solution that meets the legitimate aims of our people. For too long the South had been marginalised and neglected. That status quo was no longer acceptable, and events on the ground from August changed the context and made clear the urgent need for a solution for the Southern cause. Against this background, the Riyadh Agreement is a positive first step to shifting the status quo. For the first time there is a formal recognition of the unique nature of the Southern cause and Southerners\u2019 needs, including our legitimate demand to determine our own future. This is the cornerstone of the Southern cause that the STC can never renege on. In this regard, we now look forward to engaging with the Yemeni government, as an equal partner and signatory of this Agreement, to ensure the security, governance, protection, and development of South Yemen. To be clear: the Riyadh Agreement offers a critical window of opportunity but more work lies ahead. It is a key stepping stone to the broader political effort under the auspices of the UN. As we have reiterated previously, any UN political process needs to be broad and inclusive at all stages, and to address a comprehensive range of issues, including the Southern issue. A piecemeal approach would only fall short in delivery as we have seen with past political initiatives. We therefore welcome the recognition of our key role in the Agreement and our guaranteed participation in the UN political process led by Envoy Martin Griffiths. For the first time, the UN process would have legitimate Southern representatives through the STC at the negotiating table to advocate for the South within the broader political solution for the Yemeni crisis. We remain fully committed to playing our part and to intensifying our diplomatic engagement for a solution for the South through democratic means.

This approach came against a backdrop of escalation on the ground against our people, as evident by the attacks against South Yemen at the start of August. As we stated clearly from the beginning, the solution to the crisis was and remains a political one. This is why the STC took all necessary measures to ensure the protection of civilians in the South, restore security and stability in Aden, and intensify our diplomatic efforts to bring about a sustainable and long lasting solution that meets the legitimate aims of our people. For too long the South had been marginalised and neglected. That status quo was no longer acceptable, and events on the ground from August changed the context and made clear the urgent need for a solution for the Southern cause. Against this background, the Riyadh Agreement is a positive first step to shifting the status quo. For the first time there is a formal recognition of the unique nature of the Southern cause and Southerners\u2019 needs, including our legitimate demand to determine our own future. This is the cornerstone of the Southern cause that the STC can never renege on. In this regard, we now look forward to engaging with the Yemeni government, as an equal partner and signatory of this Agreement, to ensure the security, governance, protection, and development of South Yemen. To be clear: the Riyadh Agreement offers a critical window of opportunity but more work lies ahead. It is a key stepping stone to the broader political effort under the auspices of the UN. As we have reiterated previously, any UN political process needs to be broad and inclusive at all stages, and to address a comprehensive range of issues, including the Southern issue. A piecemeal approach would only fall short in delivery as we have seen with past political initiatives. We therefore welcome the recognition of our key role in the Agreement and our guaranteed participation in the UN political process led by Envoy Martin Griffiths. For the first time, the UN process would have legitimate Southern representatives through the STC at the negotiating table to advocate for the South within the broader political solution for the Yemeni crisis. We remain fully committed to playing our part and to intensifying our diplomatic engagement for a solution for the South through democratic means.
