The principal belligerents on one side \u2013 Saudi Arabia and until recently the United Arab Emirates, heavily backed by the United States and the United Kingdom \u2013 are by far also the largest contributors to the humanitarian relief effort. This allows them to say they are saving Yemeni lives on the one hand while taking them with the other, to say they are feeding Yemen while destroying the economy and infrastructure by which the country might feed itself. Were Yemen to fall into widespread famine, the war would become untenable among the \u2018international community\u2019, and thus providing relief funds is self-serving for these belligerents, allowing them to continue prosecuting the conflict in search of their desired ends.", "Given that the majority of Yemen\u2019s population lives in the north most of this aid has gone to areas controlled by the other side. The armed Houthi movement has so thoroughly corralled United Nations agencies and aid organizations that the relief effort, worth almost US$4 billion in 2019 alone, now forms a critical source of rent and influence for the group\u2019s own war effort. This situation came about as a result of the UN and aid organizations progressively and profoundly surrendering their humanitarian principles to try and secure access to needy populations. In doing so, however, these humanitarian actors have reluctantly been providing hefty subsidies for Houthi operations \u2013 which include weaponizing starvation, recruiting child soldiers, planting millions of landmines in civilian areas, sexual violence and mass campaigns of arrest and torture.", "Humanitarian workers, speaking to the Sana\u2019a Center, have described how, once international aid enters northern areas, the Houthi authorities essentially dictate to UN agencies and international non-governmental organizations the terms of how it is stored and transported, where and when it is distributed, and to whom. Houthi forces have used their control over access to aid, or the threat of its denial, as a means to recruit soldiers from hungry communities in Yemen, to reward support or punish dissent in northern areas, and for cash income through selling the aid supplies on the market. At times corruption has also taken hold within the aid effort itself, with The Associated Press last year revealing a scheme by a small group of foreign staff to embezzle millions of dollars from the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, UN and INGO attempts to verify aid recipients, monitor distribution and even collect basic data for population needs assessments are made nearly impossible due to Houthi-imposed bureaucratic delays, access restrictions and permit denials.", "While the UN regularly publishes numbers regarding how many millions of people in Yemen are facing imminent famine, food insecure or otherwise in humanitarian need, it has been extremely difficult to verify these statistics with on-the-ground surveys. Indeed, evidence suggests that in some locations needs have been inflated to garner more resources, while at the same time other areas remain overlooked and underserved. Put another way, no definitive data actually exists to confirm the often-stated claim that Yemen is \u201cthe world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis\u201d, though it may be the world\u2019s worst humanitarian response.", "There is without question immense humanitarian need in Yemen; however, many UN and INGO staff on the ground \u2013 the people in the best position to know \u2013 have lost confidence that the relief effort, as it is currently being conducted, is helping the situation. At best, it is offering a few Yemenis the brief reprieve humanitarian aid is meant to provide, but in exchange for indefinite suffering through a drawn-out conflict.", "Recent international threats to withdraw aid funds from northern areas if the Houthi authorities do not loosen their throttle hold over the relief effort have shown a degree of success \u2013 such as getting the Houthis to agree to back down on a proposed 2 percent tax on all humanitarian operations, though indications are that the Houthis are pursuing other avenues to recoup these funds from relief agencies. And even here the response of the humanitarian actors is ethically fraught. It is because the United Nations had been so fearful of losing access that the humanitarian effort became so compromised, and the UN only began to meaningfully confront the Houthis last year after it was forced to by media reports exposing the rampant and systematic theft of food aid.", "While the heads of UN agencies were confronted with crushing responsibility and immensely difficult choices during the Yemen conflict, they are also meant to be the standard bearers of humanitarian principles in the world. In this, the UN abdicated its responsibility in Yemen. Into this vacuum, the donors \u2013 the largest of whom are active belligerents on one side of this conflict \u2013 are now stepping in. This sets a new, dangerous precedent and further erodes the UN\u2019s ability to direct a needs-based relief effort that is autonomous from the objectives \u2013 political, economic, military or otherwise \u2013 of actors in this war \u2013 by Sanaa Center", "https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/9120", "(** B H K P)", "The War Over Aid \u2013 The Yemen Review, January/February 2020", "Contents", "The War Over Aid", "Houthi Aid Interference Prompts Threats to Cut Funding", "Looming Monetary Threats Risk Rapid Inflation as International Aid is Reduced", "Developments in Yemen", "Frontlines Erupt, Airstrikes and Cross-Border Attacks Resume", "Fierce Fighting Between Houthi, Govt Forces in Various Governorates", "Deadly Uptick in Air and Missile Strikes During Northern Fighting", "Houthis Shoot Down Saudi Warplane in Al-Jawf", "Yemeni Defense Minister\u2019s Convoy Strikes Landmine in Marib, 6 Killed", "UN Warns Escalation Could Wipe Out All Recent Progress", "Military and Security Developments", "Saudi Troops and Local Tribes Clash in Al-Mahra, Governor Dismissed", "Graphic: Al-Mahra Governorate Conflict, February 2020", "The End of AQAP as a Global Threat \u2013 Commentary by Gregory Johnsen", "Not So Fast: Founder\u2019s Death a Blow to AQAP, but not Fatal \u2013 Commentary by Hussam Radman", "Political Developments", "Hopes Emerge for Long-Awaited Prisoner Exchange", "Riyadh Agreement Hangs by a Thread Amid Rising Tension in Southern Yemen", "Political Developments in Brief", "Humanitarian and Human Rights Developments", "Saudi Announces Trials for Air Raids on Hospital, Wedding, School Bus", "First \u2018Mercy Flights\u2019 Carrying Critically Ill Depart Sana\u2019a Airport", "Civilian Casualties Climbing, More than 35,000 newly displaced, Hospitals Hit", "Egyptian Fishermen Killed by Sea Mine, 32 Others Freed From Houthi Jails", "Amid Coronavirus Outbreak, Yemeni Students Still Stuck in Wuhan", "Graphic: Commercial Flights to and from Yemen", "International Developments", "At the United Nations", "Security Council Splits on How Strongly to Rebuke Houthis", "UN-Appointed Experts Report on Sanctions Breaches, Arms Investigations", "At the UN in Brief", "In the United States", "US Extends Temporary Protected Status For Yemen, Deportation Risk Remains", "Democrat Candidates United In Opposing US Support for Saudi-led Coalition", "Developments in the US in Brief", "In the Region", "Where is Saudi Arabia Headed in Yemen? \u2013 Commentary by Thomas Juneau", "US Kills Quds Force Leader, Targets Iranian Commander in Yemen", "Oman\u2019s Sultan Qaboos Dies After 49 Years of Rule", "UAE Withdraws More Troops, Shifts to Background Role via Proxies", "Official: Fewer Than 1,000 Sudanese Troops Left in Yemen", "In Europe", "UK Firm Seeks Arrest of UAE Officials for Suspected War Crimes, Torture in Yemen", "Development in Europe In Brief", "The War Over Aid", "Houthi Aid Interference Prompts Threats to Cut Funding", "Mounting disputes between aid agencies and Houthi authorities in Sana\u2019a that have severely impeded the relief effort and a donor rebellion could result in deep cuts to vital humanitarian aid.

Securing visas for international humanitarian staff requires permission from the Houthi-run Supreme Council for the Management and Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and International Cooperation (SCMCHA), health ministry and national security; these bodies often are not aligned, and if one rejects the application, the process must begin again. The process takes up to six months, sometimes culminating with a refusal for absurd reasons, while Houthi authorities frequently lose papers, according to the aid worker. Meanwhile, to travel within Yemen, staff must request a travel permit from Houthi authorities a week in advance.", "The internationally recognized government requires international humanitarian staff entering any part of Yemen to obtain a visa from their authorities, a process that usually takes 24 hours, but the government refuses visas for Lebanese, Iraqis, Iranians and Syrians. Meanwhile, Houthi authorities refuse visas to anyone who has been to Gaza. Combined, these restrictions limit the pool of staff that the sector can recruit from, the aid worker explained.", "Obtaining permission from Houthi authorities to bring in humanitarian supplies can take up to six months, sometimes past the shelf-life of the food or medicine being imported. Houthi authorities insist INGOs use Houthi trucks to transport supplies, creating another stream of income for the Houthis through transport fees. Further, Houthi authorities raised social security deductions on humanitarian staff\u2019s salaries from 15 to 18 percent; organizations that do not pay risk refusals for visas and travel permits, the aid worker said.", "To attend training abroad, humanitarian staff must obtain authorization from the Houthis; this requires presenting the training curriculum and attending an interview with Houthi officials who decide whether or not to allow the staff member to attend. A recent restriction imposed by SCMCHA forbids INGO staff from meeting with any Houthi authorities or officials except SCMCHA, according to the aid worker.", "UN and INGO officials had said little publicly about details of their dispute and past cooperation and financial arrangements with the Houthi authorities. However, Mark Lowcock, the UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, briefed the UN Security Council in open session on the issue February 18, the day before The Associated Press published an investigation into the situation.[3] The AP investigation, based on dozens of documents and interviews with anonymous aid officials who said they feared reprisals for speaking out, found that:", "UN agencies have refused to sign agreements to accept the new directives. In his UN Security Council briefing, Lowcock cited issues with both sides in the conflict but described \u201cmuch more serious problems\u201d in Houthi-controlled areas.[4] He confirmed the 200-plus new directives and said that by the end of 2019, incidents of Houthi disruption of assistance were six times greater than at the start of the year. Lowcock characterized half of the incidents as constraints on movement of staff or supplies and said about a quarter involved trying to influence aid decisions or otherwise interfere in programs. He confirmed Houthi authorities had demanded a 2 percent tax on all aid funding \u2014 and noted they had rescinded the demand in February \u2014 and that NGOs were asked to sign agreements that were inconsistent with humanitarian principles (see \u201cHouthis Replace Aid Coordination Body; UN Cites \u2018Alarming\u2019 Mistreatment,\u201d The Yemen Review, November 2019).[5]", "In remarks just ahead of the Brussels meeting, the head of SCMCHA, Abdel Mohsen Tawoos, described threats to cut aid as \u201cextortion\u201d that would not work.[6] As the pressure increased, however, the Houthis made some other concessions.", "Houthi authorities failed to approve 40 percent of NGO projects in 2019, which Lowcock compared to the 30 percent of projects stopped because the internationally recognized Yemeni government failed to approve them.", "Looming Monetary Threats Risk Rapid Inflation as International Aid is Reduced", "The potential for large cuts to relief funding will put downward pressure on the value of the domestic currency, the Yemeni rial (YR), given that foreign aid today constitutes one of the country\u2019s largest sources of foreign currency.

What this relationship is and what it is not, with its domestic, regional and international complexities, can be clarified somewhat by analyzing the ideological and theological underpinnings of both groups, and the power structures that currently govern Sana\u2019a and large parts of northern Yemen. A preliminary reading of the structure of the Houthi regime and an examination of its discourse and imagery shows that the Houthis are in part indebted to the Islamic Republic of Iran for establishing a body of language, symbols of resistance and revolution, as well as an organizational structure to draw on.", "The following paper examines this, as well as how the ideology of revolution, with its basis in Shia theological concepts and the realities of the regional order, underpins the connections between the Houthis and Iran. This paper does not, however, examine the extent of direct Iranian involvement in the Yemen War, which is the subject of much dispute. International reports have alleged that Iran is involved in illegally supplying the Houthis with arms, fuel and money.[2] Attempts by various media and political actors to describe the conflict, now in its fifth year, as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran usually overlook the Houthis\u2019 other means of support in Yemen. For instance, on the financial front, the UN Panel of Experts on Yemen estimated the Houthis had access to a minimum of 407 billion Yemeni rials (US$1.62 billion at the fixed rate in 2017, the time of the research) annually from the national economy in areas they control, and that they generate revenues from taxes and customs, telecommunications, blackmail of merchants and fuel trading on the black market.[3] Thus, while the authors acknowledge that an assessment of any direct command-and-control links between Tehran and the Houthis deserves greater research, it is beyond the scope of this article.", "Tehran\u2019s Revolutionary Doctrine and the \u2018Axis of Resistance\u2019", "While \u201cexporting the revolution\u201d was a key doctrine of the clerical regime established in Iran after 1979,[6] the long war with Iraq and the limited appeal of an explicitly Twelver Shia ideology in the majority Sunni Middle East led to a certain amount of pragmatism in Iran\u2019s search for regional allies and proxies. As such, Iranian support for foreign groups is not necessarily tied to direct religious affiliation, but rather rests with wider ideological principles such as anti-imperialism and opposition to Israel, the United States and its allies such as Saudi Arabia.[7]", "The Houthi Leadership\u2019s Stance Toward Iranian Ideology", "Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi did not conceal his fascination with the Iranian model, and he held Ayatollah Khomeini as a just and righteous leader whose efforts to resist Western influence in the Middle East should be imitated. He suggested that the model of the Iranian Revolution was the best example to follow, arguing: \u201cLook at those who have managed to build a great nation. This can be applied to Iran, which has achieved a huge leap since the Islamic Revolution. Are not those (the Iranians) who secure life and produce men and build nations?\u201d[25] Concerned by what he believed to be the humiliation of the Arabs by their Western enemies, most prominently the US and Israel, Al-Houthi saw in Iran the possibility of leading the Arabs toward \u201cdignity and glory,\u201d given its appeal as a Shia and anti-imperialist revolutionary model.[26]", "Nevertheless, Al-Houthi on many occasions explicitly rejected Twelver Shiism, for example mocking the concept of the Mahdi and the doctrine of the Hidden Imam.[27] Instead, he distinguished Zaidis as the \u201celite\u201d among all Islamic sects, the \u201ctrue believers,\u201d and claimed that revolution against injustice formed the main principle of Zaidi Islam.[28] His commitment to revolution came from \u201can absolute commitment to the principle [of] \u2018commanding what is just and forbidding what is wrong\u2019\u201d in Zaidi thought,[29] a classical Zaidi political theory following from belief in divine justice.[30] While Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi criticized Twelver doctrine, he justified his admiration for Iran, Khomeini and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in terms of administration and action:", "Through the course of the ongoing conflict in Yemen, however, Iranian influences have increasingly been seen in the promotion of many cultural and religious activities that have no clear links to Zaidi history in Yemen. This includes the commemorations of Ashoura (the mourning of the marytrdom of Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed) and Al-Quds International Day (a yearly event declared by Khomeini to express support for the Palestinian cause and oppose Israel and Zionism).", "From this basis, the discourse, imagery and structure of the Houthi regime under the leadership of Abdelmalek al-Houthi, the current leader of the movement and the brother of Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, will be addressed and compared to that of Iran. While still considered a Zaidi religious leader, Abdelmalek al-Houthi\u2019s rhetoric since the Arab uprisings of 2011 and the takeover of Sana\u2019a in 2014 has emphasized nationalism and the Houthi brand of social justice, downplaying the Zaidi revivalist origins of the Houthi movement.[34]", "Slogans and Imagery Reflect Shared Revolutionary Themes", "Like Iran\u2019s other allies and proxies in the region, the Houthis draw on a body of anti-imperialist, anti-Zionist and Islamist slogans and images which became popularized by Iran\u2019s Islamic Republic. Indeed, the mindset of the Houthi insurgency owes much to \u201cthe scream\u201d (al-sarkha): \u201cGod is great, death to America, death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews, victory to Islam.\u201d[35] In this slogan, three pillars of the Houthi ideology with similarities to those of the Iranian revolution are apparent: anti-imperialism (through opposition to the US), anti-Zionism (through opposition to Israel) and Islamism.", "As a political entity the Houthis dubbed themselves Ansar Allah (Supporters of God), similar to Lebanese Hezbollah (Party of God). An early emblem widely associated with the Houthis and used outside of Yemen by Iranian and Lebanese media, apparently without the group\u2019s objection, shared common elements and features with those of Hezbollah and the seal of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups such as Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba and Kataeb Hezbollah also employ similar images in their logos \u2013 By Mohammed Almahfali & James Root", "https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9050", "(** B P)", "Once Saudi Allies, Tribes in Eastern Yemen\u2019s Al-Mahrah Are Now Battling Saudi Forces", "Saudi Arabia has long sought control over eastern Yemen for its unfettered access to the Arabian Sea.

The attack came after Saudi forces occupied al Shehn port last week.", "Since 2017, when Saudi forces once again entered the isolated province, the deep-seated sense of local identity spurred a growing opposition movement.

Today, Saudi Arabia controls al-Mahrah\u2019s airport and Saudi forces have assumed a role akin to a state security apparatus in the province as air reconnaissance and other operations are launched from a command center at the base, bypassing even its allies. In addition to border crossings and the main seaport, dozens of Saudi bases have been established in Hat District, Lusick in Hawf District, Jawdah in Huswain District, and Darfat in Sayhut District.", "Moreover, the militarization of al-Mahrah by Saudi forces has affectedthe province\u2019s social cohesion and identity. Maharis were already divided between opposing the presence of Saudi forces and supporting it. The Saudi have reinforced this division by recruiting from and distributing weapons to certain tribes, changing the social fabric of the area which is likely to lead to open internal conflict.", "Despite the fact that local opposition has prevented the construction of several military outposts, Saudi forces have continued to pursue their strategic interests in southern Yemen, including the construction of an oil shipping port in al-Mahrah on the coast of the Arabian Sea. This has resulted in renewed calls for military resistance against the Saudi presence, with opposition leaders declaring their intention to establish local anti-Saudi forces.", "Al-Mahrah\u2019s tribes vow resistance", "Attacks from Al-Mahrah\u2019s tribes have flared up as recently as last week after Saudi forces began construction on a number of new security checkpoints and military camps in al Shehn District. Last Monday, Saudi forces attempted to storm the town of Shahn.

Later, Saudi forces succeeded in occupying the area after resorting to a plan played by the ousted president Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi.", "Prior to Monday\u2019s Saudi military incursion, local tribal fighters had withdrawn from Shehn after an agreement between Saudi forces and local tribes was reached following tribal mediation which stipulated that tribal fighters in the town would be replaced by forces loyal to the Saudi-led Coalition.

The move is seen as an attempt to implement a new Saudi strategy, according to al-Mahrah residents. Mahris have a unique history of running their own affairs.

While the causes for interventions have been at the heart of studies on interventions, the dynamics of termination versus escalation have received little attention. This article poses the question: why do intervenors persist in failed military interventions despite diminishing prospects of victory? Whereas some scholars adhered to rational choice approaches, others focused on cognitive and emotional psychology to explain seemingly puzzling decisions at the origin of war continuation. This article builds on the emerging literature on status in IR to unravel the escalation of commitment to a failed war. It argues that when leaders engage their own status and that of their countries to an eventual success in a military intervention, persistence in the war becomes the only solution to salvage their status. Through this lens, this article presents an explanation for Saudi and Emirati escalations in what was planned as a brief operation in Yemen since 2015. Understanding the dynamics of persisting in failed wars has clear implications for the development of international relations theory, the conduct of regional powers in military interventions, and the practice of conflict resolution in the Middle East and beyond.
