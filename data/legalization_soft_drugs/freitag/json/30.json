People who are even more extreme than the ruling, the dominant group in Saudi Arabia, to export it. So we saw that most vividly in the 1980s, when people like Osama bin Laden and his followers moved to Afghanistan and were financed, encouraged to do so by the regime in Saudi Arabia. We've seen it more recently in Syria, where they've done the same thing. And in 1979 in Yemen, as you just said, they sent someone who just tried to overthrow the Saudi regime, amazingly. ... But they let him out and said, \"OK, off you go to northern Yemen,\" and he set up a madrassa, sort of an academy, which over the years became a hotbed of extreme Wahhabism, which the local Zaidis didn't care for at all. And in reaction, they turned to Iran and asked for, really, not weapons or anything, but initially at least for instructors and literature. They thought they should get serious about their religion, and they sort of drifted more towards the sort of mainstream Iranian Shia variant.", "So this guy Hussein al-Houthi was the leader of the Shias in Yemen who turned to Iran for religious inspiration?", "That's right.", "Were the Houthis engaging in terrorism?", "There's no sign of that at all.

The Houthis sent, it was a few, 300 men, I think from memory, went into Saudi Arabia. Then the Saudis sort of freaked out and declared a general mobile military mobilization and began bombing northern Yemen, bombing the Houthi territory. But actually, they lost. The Houthis defeated the Saudi ground forces that were sent against them. And the Saudi air force, it was bombing away and did hit some of the main Houthi city, Sa'dah.
