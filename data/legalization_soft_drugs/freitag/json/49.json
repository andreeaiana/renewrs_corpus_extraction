These attacks clearly damaged and destroyed these monuments. On March 28th, 2015, an Ansar Allah (Houthis) tank targeted the Dar al-Hajar Palace in the Al-Houta district, the capital of Lahij governorate. The attack resulted in extensive destruction of parts of the palace.

Well, in 2011, that was the situation of the United States when it came to the arms trade. This country sold more than three-quarters of the weapons on the global arms market (a significant proportion of them into the already violent Middle East). And that should still be stunning. But I\u2019d bet top dollars that, while you could read about it then, that remarkable fact wasn\u2019t a front-page story. It wasn\u2019t, in fact, much of a story at all. In the intervening years, as the arms trade has grown back to near Cold War levels, especially in the Middle East, the U.S. has solidified its position as the planet\u2019s major arms salesman, sending weaponry to at least 98 countries. In 2018, for instance, 54% of the weaponry going into the Middle Eastern arms market was ours and yet while this information is available, in a world where the cheers, boos, and chants that now greet any public appearance by Donald Trump are a top news story, America\u2019s role in the global weapons trade is, at best, an afterthought. (It matters little that, in polls, 70% of Americans oppose our selling arms to any other country at all as a danger to the world.)", "Don\u2019t you consider it just a tad strange that the media of the nation that -- no matter the president in these years -- continues to flood the world with weaponry of just about every imaginable sort, pays remarkably little attention to that fact? \u2013 by Tom Engelhardt", "America\u2019s Arms Sales Addiction", "The 50-Year History of U.S. Dominance of the Middle Eastern Arms Trade", "All the American arms sales to the Middle East have had a severe and lasting set of consequences in the region in, as a start, the brutal Saudi/United Arab Emirates war in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians via air strikes using U.S. weaponry and pushed millions of Yemenis to the brink of famine. And don\u2019t forget the recent Turkish invasion of Syria in which both the Turkish forces and the Kurdish-led militias they attacked relied heavily on U.S.-supplied weaponry.", "Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear that he cares far more about making deals for that weaponry than who uses any of it against whom.

Well, in 2011, that was the situation of the United States when it came to the arms trade. This country sold more than three-quarters of the weapons on the global arms market (a significant proportion of them into the already violent Middle East). And that should still be stunning. But I\u2019d bet top dollars that, while you could read about it then, that remarkable fact wasn\u2019t a front-page story. It wasn\u2019t, in fact, much of a story at all. In the intervening years, as the arms trade has grown back to near Cold War levels, especially in the Middle East, the U.S. has solidified its position as the planet\u2019s major arms salesman, sending weaponry to at least 98 countries. In 2018, for instance, 54% of the weaponry going into the Middle Eastern arms market was ours and yet while this information is available, in a world where the cheers, boos, and chants that now greet any public appearance by Donald Trump are a top news story, America\u2019s role in the global weapons trade is, at best, an afterthought.

And don\u2019t forget the recent Turkish invasion of Syria in which both the Turkish forces and the Kurdish-led militias they attacked relied heavily on U.S.-supplied weaponry.", "Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear that he cares far more about making deals for that weaponry than who uses any of it against whom.

Well, in 2011, that was the situation of the United States when it came to the arms trade. This country sold more than three-quarters of the weapons on the global arms market (a significant proportion of them into the already violent Middle East). And that should still be stunning. But I\u2019d bet top dollars that, while you could read about it then, that remarkable fact wasn\u2019t a front-page story. It wasn\u2019t, in fact, much of a story at all. In the intervening years, as the arms trade has grown back to near Cold War levels, especially in the Middle East, the U.S. has solidified its position as the planet\u2019s major arms salesman, sending weaponry to at least 98 countries. In 2018, for instance, 54% of the weaponry going into the Middle Eastern arms market was ours and yet while this information is available, in a world where the cheers, boos, and chants that now greet any public appearance by Donald Trump are a top news story, America\u2019s role in the global weapons trade is, at best, an afterthought.

And don\u2019t forget the recent Turkish invasion of Syria in which both the Turkish forces and the Kurdish-led militias they attacked relied heavily on U.S.-supplied weaponry.", "Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear that he cares far more about making deals for that weaponry than who uses any of it against whom.

It\u2019s important to note, however, that, historically speaking, he\u2019s been anything but unique in his obsession with promoting such weapons exports (though he is uniquely loud about doing so).", "The U.S. government\u2019s stated rationales for pouring arms into that ever-more-embattled region include: building partnerships with countries theoretically willing to fight alongside U.S. forces in a crisis; swapping arms for access to military bases in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and other Persian Gulf states; creating \u201cstability\u201d by building up allied militaries to be stronger than those of potential adversaries like Iran; and generating revenue for U.S. weapons contractors, as well as jobs for American workers. Of course, such sales have indeed benefited those contractors and secured access to bases in the region, but when it comes to promoting stability and security, historically it\u2019s been another story entirely.", "The Nixon Doctrine and the Initial Surge in Mideast Arms Sales", "Washington\u2019s role as the Middle East\u2019s top arms supplier has its roots in remarks made by Richard Nixon half a century ago on the island of Guam.", "The core of what came to be known as the Nixon Doctrine was the arming of regional surrogates, countries with sympathetic rulers or governments that could promote U.S. interests without major contingents of the American military being on hand. Of such potential surrogates at that moment, the most important was the Shah of Iran", "In the Nixon years, Saudi Arabia, too, became a major weapons client of Washington, not so much because it feared its regional neighbors then, but because it had seemingly limitless oil funds to subsidize U.S. weapons makers at a time when the Pentagon budget was beginning to be reduced. In addition, Saudi sales helped recoup some of the revenue streaming out of the U.S. to pay for higher energy prices exacted by the newly formed OPEC oil cartel. It was a process then quaintly known as \u201crecycling petrodollars.\u201d", "The Carter Years and the Quest for Restraint", "The freewheeling arms trade of the Nixon years eventually prompted a backlash. In 1976, for the first (and last) time, a presidential candidate -- Jimmy Carter -- made reining in the arms trade a central theme of his 1976 campaign for the White House. He called for imposing greater human-rights scrutiny on arms exports, reducing the total volume of arms transfers, and initiating talks with the Soviet Union on curbing sales to regions of tension like the Middle East.", "Who Armed Saddam Hussein?", "While the volume of those arms sales didn\u2019t spike dramatically under President Ronald Reagan, his determination to weaponize anti-communist \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d from Afghanistan to Nicaragua sparked the Iran-Contra scandal.", "Worse yet, the Reagan administration transferred arms and provided training to extremist mujahedeen factions in Afghanistan,", "The Addiction Continues", "Donald Trump has carried on the practice of offering weaponry in quantity to allies in the Middle East, especially the Saudis, though his major rationale for the deals is to generate domestic jobs and revenues for the major weapons contractors. In fact, investing money and effort in almost anything else, from infrastructure to renewable energy technologies, would produce more jobs in the U.S. No matter though, the beat just goes on.", "One notable development of the Trump years has been a revived Congressional interest in curbing weapons sales, with a particular focus on ending support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.", "Such deals with Saudi Arabia and other Mideast states may be hugely popular with the companies that profit from the trade, but the vast majority of Americans oppose runaway arms trading on the sensible grounds that it makes the world less safe. The question now is: Will Congress play a greater role in attempting to block such weapons deals with the Saudis and human-rights abusers or will America\u2019s weapons-sales addiction and its monopoly position in the Middle Eastern arms trade simply continue, setting the stage for future disasters of every sort? \u2013 by William D.
