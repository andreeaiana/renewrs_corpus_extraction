What the agreement signed on November 5 in the Saudi capital may mean is that for the first time since the war began the disparate forces that make up the anti-Houthi coalition could come under a unified command and control, and that there may be one fewer state-within-a-state in Yemen to contend with.", "While Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government and the secessionist Southern Transitional Council (STC) had been at odds since the latter\u2019s inception in 2017, more recently there has also been searing tension between the two primary backers of these Yemeni parties, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, respectively. The Riyadh Agreement seeks to put these differences to rest", "In reshaping the Yemeni cabinet and making it explicitly beholden to Saudi Arabia, the Riyadh Agreement could mean that President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi\u2019s decisions will no longer be dictated by his sons or his political ally, Yemen\u2019s Islah Party. Instead, Hadi and the STC have accepted that all major government actions be subordinated to Saudi Arabia. The STC, in an abrupt turn, also has accepted to be under an arrangement that explicitly endorses a unified Yemeni state, in so doing opening the door for its representatives to be present at any future United Nations-led peace talks to end the wider war. By staging a coup against the Yemeni government in Aden this past August, the STC has thus earned its place in the cabinet and international recognition, in another normalization of violence as a means to political ends.", "From a purely conflict resolution perspective, having more of the main belligerents represented at the table is good news.", "With the anti-Houthi side thus seemingly unifying under Saudi patronage, for better or worse, Riyadh now owns what happens, and what doesn\u2019t happen, in southern Yemen. While unwritten in the actual text, it would appear the new hierarchy the agreement envisions will specifically be headed by Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, who has quietly assumed responsibility for the Yemen file from his brother, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince and defense minister.", "Khalid bin Salman\u2019s vested interest in the agreement\u2019s success and the back-channel conversations between him and the Houthis which began in September, as reported by the Sana\u2019a Center, could foster the necessary matrix for a broader peace process in Yemen among all sides. It could allow Saudi Arabia to regain one thing it had in 2011, following the Yemeni uprising, and lost again in 2015 with the start of its military intervention in Yemen, which is the ability to be an umbrella over everyone to reach a peace deal in the country.", "A worst-case scenario for the Riyadh Agreement, however, is that it turns into a mass wedding but no one is quite sure who is meant to be married to whom, and chaos ensues. The vastness of the profound military and political reforms that the agreement calls for, the vagueness on the specifics regarding how these reforms should be undertaken and the hyperoptimistic time frame within which they should be completed leaves one to wonder if anything but chaos is possible.", "At best, the current Riyadh Agreement should thus be approached with cautious optimism.", "For the agreement to succeed Saudi Arabia cannot approach it as an end in itself, but as part of a larger effort to reconstitute the Yemeni government, end the conflict and bring about stability in its southern neighbor. Three steps to demonstrate this seriousness would be to: 1) put real money and resources into helping reform Yemeni government finances and economic practices, rather than just throwing money at the problem when it reaches a crisis point; 2) reopen Sana\u2019a Airport to commercial flights, beginning with medical evacuations for those with emergencies; 3) stop deporting hundreds of thousands of Yemeni laborers as part of the Saudi Vision 2030\u2019s aims for \u2018Saudization\u2019 of the labour force \u2013 in the years to come the loss of these remittances to Yemen, currently the country\u2019s largest source of foreign currency, will cause untold hardship and undoubtedly reignite socioeconomic instability and conflict.", "Whatever the outcome of the Riyadh Agreement, history will remember that Yemeni government and STC leaders alike smiled at the cameras and hailed the Riyadh Agreement as a triumph. These men who denounce the Houthis as Iranian proxies themselves celebrated signing over the country\u2019s sovereignty, and their own legitimacy and authority, to a foreign power.", "https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/8380", "(** B K P)", "Peace Is Possible in Yemen", "Out of a Moment of Crisis, a Chance for a Solution", "Both within Yemen\u2019s borders and in the wider region, further bloodshed seemed inevitable.", "Yet, in an unexpected turn of events, these flare-ups appear to have opened a pathway to peace.", "If both the Riyadh agreement and the Saudi-Houthi initiative survive, and UN mediators are able to weave them into a single negotiation track, a national political settlement could be possible.", "That is a big if. Reaching a national political settlement in Yemen will require both winding down the Saudi-led military intervention and bridging the gaping divides among the country\u2019s many armed groups and political factions. It is entirely possible that current negotiations will grind to a halt or fall apart. If that happens, the conflict will likely deepen and expand. Saudi Arabia and Iran will both intensify their struggle for influence, and Yemen will dissolve further into a mess of warring mini-states, each with its own international backer.", "The Saudis appear to have concluded that even if they can\u2019t beat the Houthis militarily, they must at least drive a wedge between the rebels and their Iranian backer with financial and political inducements. To succeed, however, they will need to win over or at least mitigate the influence of Houthi hard-liners while strengthening the hand of Houthi pragmatists by reducing the level of violence, delivering economic gains, and ultimately an end to cross-border hostilities.", "Saudi Arabia\u2019s interest in reviving talks with the Houthis was probably influenced by the UAE\u2019s recent decision to draw down its forces in Yemen.", "Combined, all of these developments form a pathway to a political settlement in Yemen, the most promising that diplomats and UN officials say they have seen in years.", "A LONG WAY TO GO", "A lot could still go wrong. A Houthi missile fired into Saudi Arabia that kills civilians, or a Saudi air strike that kills Yemeni civilians, could restart the cycle of violence. There is also a risk that Saudi Arabia will use the agreement between the STC and the Hadi government not to pursue peace talks but to ramp up the war effort against the Houthis. That is the fear of many diplomats and analysts, and the wish of some anti-Houthi groups and officials in Hadi\u2019s government.", "Just as tenuous is the Saudi-brokered deal between Hadi\u2019s government and the STC. Enmity between the two factions still runs high, and officials from both groups express pessimism over the agreement\u2019s durability.", "The deal is also vaguely worded and offers little guidance on implementation.", "There are also concerns about Riyadh\u2019s capacity to manage implementation of the accord. And given Riyadh\u2019s continued support for Hadi, some in the president\u2019s camp could conclude that they have the upper hand. If Hadi\u2019s government grows overconfident, it could provoke renewed fighting with the STC.", "Even if the southern power-sharing deal holds and the Saudi-Houthi de-escalation process stays on track, the road to durable peace in Yemen will be long and circuitous. Some five years of fighting have swept away large parts of the old order and changed the political landscape of the country.", "Much will turn on Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability and resolve to manage the two different strands of negotiations, and to eventually convince the Hadi government that it must sue for peace with the Houthis. But even as the Saudis facilitate intra-Yemeni negotiations, it is the Yemenis who will determine the outcome. A settlement to the swirling conflicts in Yemen is arguably closer now than at any point in the last five years, but that doesn\u2019t mean that peace is around the corner. Some of the country\u2019s unresolved issues\u2014such as the question of whether the south will secede\u2014may result in more violence no matter what diplomats achieve.

Yemen also has high rates of illiteracy and together with Egypt and Iraq, makes up three-quarters of the 10 million illiterate youth in the region \u2013 two-thirds of which are girls.", "Yemen\u2019s pre-existing social deficit, the profound lack of basic services such as housing, education, healthcare, sanitation and jobs, has been compounded by political volatility, religious radicalisation, armed conflicts, shortages of food and water and dwindling of natural resources through mismanagement and corruption.

The Houthis reaffirmed that their anti-Israel position is based on a principled, humanitarian, moral, and religious commitment. Historically, neither the Yemeni Army nor the Houthis themselves, have ever targeted Israel directly.", "The threat from Israel is not without precedent. Israel has used claims of alleged Iranian military attachments in countries like Syria and Iraq as justification for airstrikes and bombings against those nations. Now, Israel appears to be using Iran\u2019s alleged presence in Yemen, an allegation that both Tehran and the Houthis deny, as a pretext for military action in the country despite no evidence indicating that there are any Iranian forces present there.", "According to three government officials in Sana\u2019a that spoke to MintPress on the condition of anonymity, the Houthi\u2019s warnings are both serious and well-placed.

Speaking during a visit by U.S. Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin and White House aid Jared Kushner, Netanyahu claimed that Iran has supplied missiles to the Houthis that could hit Israel.

Against the backdrop of Qatar's global education agenda, enabling more than 10 million children to get liberal education across the world through organizations such as Education Above All, Qatar Charity, a government-licensed nongovernmental organization, would not work to undermine Qatar's formidable legacy in education.", "Moreover, since the blockade began, Qatar's Ministry of Education has taken a stance at home against sectarianism, removing any such references in its textbooks that originate from Wahabi teachings in Saudi Arabia.", "Thus, the purpose of this disinformation campaign is not a genuine concern for Qatar's work in Yemen. Instead, the goal is to advance the narrative that Qatar is actually colluding with Iran and its local surrogates against the West's interests.", "The Hadi government, which is ultimately Riyadh's surrogate in Yemen, levying such accusations not only factors into Saudi Arabia's current foreign policy aimed at ostracizing Qatar but also into a longer history of the kingdom fearing Qatari influence in Yemen.", "Seeing Qatar returning to Yemen albeit through humanitarian aid and being able to serve people on all sides of the conflict equally from a position of neutrality is hard for the kingdom to accept at a time when the Yemen war might be the biggest stain on Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's reputation, both domestically and internationally \u2013 by ANDREAS KRIEG and GIORGIO CAFIERO", "https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2019/11/11/could-education-in-yemen-be-new-proxy-battleground-in-the-gulf", "cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics", "(* B H)", "Dengue fever started spreading quickly in some districts & villages in Western province of #Hodeidah. 41 people have been reported death in the last week due to epdmic outbreak.

The Riyadh Agreement seeks to put these differences to rest", "In reshaping the Yemeni cabinet and making it explicitly beholden to Saudi Arabia, the Riyadh Agreement could mean that President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi\u2019s decisions will no longer be dictated by his sons or his political ally, Yemen\u2019s Islah Party. Instead, Hadi and the STC have accepted that all major government actions be subordinated to Saudi Arabia. The STC, in an abrupt turn, also has accepted to be under an arrangement that explicitly endorses a unified Yemeni state, in so doing opening the door for its representatives to be present at any future United Nations-led peace talks to end the wider war. By staging a coup against the Yemeni government in Aden this past August, the STC has thus earned its place in the cabinet and international recognition, in another normalization of violence as a means to political ends.", "From a purely conflict resolution perspective, having more of the main belligerents represented at the table is good news.", "With the anti-Houthi side thus seemingly unifying under Saudi patronage, for better or worse, Riyadh now owns what happens, and what doesn\u2019t happen, in southern Yemen. While unwritten in the actual text, it would appear the new hierarchy the agreement envisions will specifically be headed by Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, who has quietly assumed responsibility for the Yemen file from his brother, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince and defense minister.", "Khalid bin Salman\u2019s vested interest in the agreement\u2019s success and the back-channel conversations between him and the Houthis which began in September, as reported by the Sana\u2019a Center, could foster the necessary matrix for a broader peace process in Yemen among all sides. It could allow Saudi Arabia to regain one thing it had in 2011, following the Yemeni uprising, and lost again in 2015 with the start of its military intervention in Yemen, which is the ability to be an umbrella over everyone to reach a peace deal in the country.", "A worst-case scenario for the Riyadh Agreement, however, is that it turns into a mass wedding but no one is quite sure who is meant to be married to whom, and chaos ensues.

What the agreement signed on November 5 in the Saudi capital may mean is that for the first time since the war began the disparate forces that make up the anti-Houthi coalition could come under a unified command and control, and that there may be one fewer state-within-a-state in Yemen to contend with.", "While Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government and the secessionist Southern Transitional Council (STC) had been at odds since the latter\u2019s inception in 2017, more recently there has also been searing tension between the two primary backers of these Yemeni parties, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, respectively. The Riyadh Agreement seeks to put these differences to rest", "In reshaping the Yemeni cabinet and making it explicitly beholden to Saudi Arabia, the Riyadh Agreement could mean that President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi\u2019s decisions will no longer be dictated by his sons or his political ally, Yemen\u2019s Islah Party. Instead, Hadi and the STC have accepted that all major government actions be subordinated to Saudi Arabia. The STC, in an abrupt turn, also has accepted to be under an arrangement that explicitly endorses a unified Yemeni state, in so doing opening the door for its representatives to be present at any future United Nations-led peace talks to end the wider war. By staging a coup against the Yemeni government in Aden this past August, the STC has thus earned its place in the cabinet and international recognition, in another normalization of violence as a means to political ends.", "From a purely conflict resolution perspective, having more of the main belligerents represented at the table is good news.", "With the anti-Houthi side thus seemingly unifying under Saudi patronage, for better or worse, Riyadh now owns what happens, and what doesn\u2019t happen, in southern Yemen. While unwritten in the actual text, it would appear the new hierarchy the agreement envisions will specifically be headed by Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, who has quietly assumed responsibility for the Yemen file from his brother, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince and defense minister.", "Khalid bin Salman\u2019s vested interest in the agreement\u2019s success and the back-channel conversations between him and the Houthis which began in September, as reported by the Sana\u2019a Center, could foster the necessary matrix for a broader peace process in Yemen among all sides. It could allow Saudi Arabia to regain one thing it had in 2011, following the Yemeni uprising, and lost again in 2015 with the start of its military intervention in Yemen, which is the ability to be an umbrella over everyone to reach a peace deal in the country.", "A worst-case scenario for the Riyadh Agreement, however, is that it turns into a mass wedding but no one is quite sure who is meant to be married to whom, and chaos ensues. The vastness of the profound military and political reforms that the agreement calls for, the vagueness on the specifics regarding how these reforms should be undertaken and the hyperoptimistic time frame within which they should be completed leaves one to wonder if anything but chaos is possible.", "At best, the current Riyadh Agreement should thus be approached with cautious optimism.", "For the agreement to succeed Saudi Arabia cannot approach it as an end in itself, but as part of a larger effort to reconstitute the Yemeni government, end the conflict and bring about stability in its southern neighbor. Three steps to demonstrate this seriousness would be to: 1) put real money and resources into helping reform Yemeni government finances and economic practices, rather than just throwing money at the problem when it reaches a crisis point; 2) reopen Sana\u2019a Airport to commercial flights, beginning with medical evacuations for those with emergencies; 3) stop deporting hundreds of thousands of Yemeni laborers as part of the Saudi Vision 2030\u2019s aims for \u2018Saudization\u2019 of the labour force \u2013 in the years to come the loss of these remittances to Yemen, currently the country\u2019s largest source of foreign currency, will cause untold hardship and undoubtedly reignite socioeconomic instability and conflict.", "Whatever the outcome of the Riyadh Agreement, history will remember that Yemeni government and STC leaders alike smiled at the cameras and hailed the Riyadh Agreement as a triumph. These men who denounce the Houthis as Iranian proxies themselves celebrated signing over the country\u2019s sovereignty, and their own legitimacy and authority, to a foreign power.", "https://sanaacenter.org/publications/the-yemen-review/8380", "(** B K P)", "Peace Is Possible in Yemen", "Out of a Moment of Crisis, a Chance for a Solution", "Both within Yemen\u2019s borders and in the wider region, further bloodshed seemed inevitable.", "Yet, in an unexpected turn of events, these flare-ups appear to have opened a pathway to peace.", "If both the Riyadh agreement and the Saudi-Houthi initiative survive, and UN mediators are able to weave them into a single negotiation track, a national political settlement could be possible.", "That is a big if. Reaching a national political settlement in Yemen will require both winding down the Saudi-led military intervention and bridging the gaping divides among the country\u2019s many armed groups and political factions. It is entirely possible that current negotiations will grind to a halt or fall apart. If that happens, the conflict will likely deepen and expand. Saudi Arabia and Iran will both intensify their struggle for influence, and Yemen will dissolve further into a mess of warring mini-states, each with its own international backer.", "The Saudis appear to have concluded that even if they can\u2019t beat the Houthis militarily, they must at least drive a wedge between the rebels and their Iranian backer with financial and political inducements. To succeed, however, they will need to win over or at least mitigate the influence of Houthi hard-liners while strengthening the hand of Houthi pragmatists by reducing the level of violence, delivering economic gains, and ultimately an end to cross-border hostilities.", "Saudi Arabia\u2019s interest in reviving talks with the Houthis was probably influenced by the UAE\u2019s recent decision to draw down its forces in Yemen.", "Combined, all of these developments form a pathway to a political settlement in Yemen, the most promising that diplomats and UN officials say they have seen in years.", "A LONG WAY TO GO", "A lot could still go wrong. A Houthi missile fired into Saudi Arabia that kills civilians, or a Saudi air strike that kills Yemeni civilians, could restart the cycle of violence. There is also a risk that Saudi Arabia will use the agreement between the STC and the Hadi government not to pursue peace talks but to ramp up the war effort against the Houthis. That is the fear of many diplomats and analysts, and the wish of some anti-Houthi groups and officials in Hadi\u2019s government.", "Just as tenuous is the Saudi-brokered deal between Hadi\u2019s government and the STC. Enmity between the two factions still runs high, and officials from both groups express pessimism over the agreement\u2019s durability.", "The deal is also vaguely worded and offers little guidance on implementation.", "There are also concerns about Riyadh\u2019s capacity to manage implementation of the accord. And given Riyadh\u2019s continued support for Hadi, some in the president\u2019s camp could conclude that they have the upper hand. If Hadi\u2019s government grows overconfident, it could provoke renewed fighting with the STC.", "Even if the southern power-sharing deal holds and the Saudi-Houthi de-escalation process stays on track, the road to durable peace in Yemen will be long and circuitous. Some five years of fighting have swept away large parts of the old order and changed the political landscape of the country.", "Much will turn on Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability and resolve to manage the two different strands of negotiations, and to eventually convince the Hadi government that it must sue for peace with the Houthis. But even as the Saudis facilitate intra-Yemeni negotiations, it is the Yemenis who will determine the outcome. A settlement to the swirling conflicts in Yemen is arguably closer now than at any point in the last five years, but that doesn\u2019t mean that peace is around the corner. Some of the country\u2019s unresolved issues\u2014such as the question of whether the south will secede\u2014may result in more violence no matter what diplomats achieve. Still, there is now a rare window of opportunity to begin winding down the war.

Today Yemen needs a vision which will allow for its youth to look into the future with confidence, strong in the knowledge that tangible actions are being taken to address their most immediate needs.", "Interestingly enough Yemen offers a perfect demographic mirror to what is fast becoming a global challenge \u2013 there are more young people than ever (41% of the world population) and almost all share a common fear of a future scarred and marred by economic inequalities, social grievances, and lack of true political representation.", "Yemen has the most youthful age structure in the world outside of sub-Saharan Africa", "If we keep in mind that war exacerbated poverty through a complete meltdown of all civil institutions, notwithstanding the pressure internal population displacement has had on cities such as Sanaa and Aden and it appears evident that Yemen\u2019s political future and the very viability of its nation-state hinges on its political elite\u2019s ability to meet such pressing socio-economic demands.", "Over 20% of Yemen\u201fs population is aged between 15 and 24 and, according to UN estimates, by 2025 will have increased by 69% \u2013 the second fastest growth rate in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Yemen also has high rates of illiteracy and together with Egypt and Iraq, makes up three-quarters of the 10 million illiterate youth in the region \u2013 two-thirds of which are girls.", "Yemen\u2019s pre-existing social deficit, the profound lack of basic services such as housing, education, healthcare, sanitation and jobs, has been compounded by political volatility, religious radicalisation, armed conflicts, shortages of food and water and dwindling of natural resources through mismanagement and corruption.

Israel has used claims of alleged Iranian military attachments in countries like Syria and Iraq as justification for airstrikes and bombings against those nations. Now, Israel appears to be using Iran\u2019s alleged presence in Yemen, an allegation that both Tehran and the Houthis deny, as a pretext for military action in the country despite no evidence indicating that there are any Iranian forces present there.", "According to three government officials in Sana\u2019a that spoke to MintPress on the condition of anonymity, the Houthi\u2019s warnings are both serious and well-placed.

Speaking during a visit by U.S. Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin and White House aid Jared Kushner, Netanyahu claimed that Iran has supplied missiles to the Houthis that could hit Israel. The Houthis regard these statements as a justification and prelude to strikes on the country, similar to those that Israel unilaterally carried out against sites in Syria and Iraq.", "In August, Kuwaiti newspaper al-Jarida released a report saying that Israel is planning on striking sensitive positions on the Bab al-Mandab strait which links the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, to target \u201cHouthis\u201d in the area. The newspaper, which cited an anonymous informed source, said Israeli intelligence agency Mossad has been monitoring activities in the Yemeni strait.", "Israel\u2019s entry into the Yemen war could indeed open the door for further escalation, a prospect made more likely by both the increased strength of Ansar Allah forces and by Israel\u2019s increasingly cozy relationship with the Gulf Arab countries of the coalition.

There are no vital targets to be bombed in Yemen as the Saudi-led coalition has already nearly destroyed nearly every potential target, including civilian infrastructure. Moreover, any attack by Israel against Yemen will gain the Houthis even more popular support both inside of Yemen and across the Islamic and Arab world.", "Furthermore, there is no evidence that Iran has any military sites or experts in Yemen, and Yemen\u2019s Army, loyal to Ansar Allah, are not the \u201cIran proxy fighters\u201d that international media so often claims them to be", "Meanwhile, many Israeli activists and media pundits are expressing concerns over what they consider serious threats from Yemen, pointing out that these threats \u201cshould not be underestimated by the Israelis.\u201d The Israeli security parliament said that Israeli intelligence must strictly monitor Yemen and take necessary steps to secure Israeli ships sailing in the Bab Al-Mandab area, describing the statements made by Abdulmalik al-Houthi as serious.", "A well-stocked arsenal", "Indeed the threats of Ansar Allah, a group known to strike sensitive targets without hesitation, are not without precedent", "However, it would be difficult for the Yemeni Army to prevent aerial attacks by Israel.

For easily understandable reasons, Yemen's educational system has suffered enormously from this war.", "Currently, 2 million Yemeni children are unable to attend school due to the war. Within this context, any outside state attempting to help Yemen meet its extremely difficult challenges of educating its youth amid this warfare can obtain influence and soft power in the conflict-torn country.", "A question raised by Elisabeth Kendall is whether Yemen's education crisis has become the Middle East's newest \"proxy battleground.\" The narrative about Qatar Charity financing hateful textbooks in northern Yemen, which Hadi's government and its backers in the GCC are pushing, is that Qatar is allying with Iran and the Houthis to produce, as one Yemeni scholar put it, a \"new sectarian generation\" among the youth in Yemen.", "This narrative is inconsistent with the inclusive work that Qatar Charity is doing in Yemen. Against the backdrop of Qatar's global education agenda, enabling more than 10 million children to get liberal education across the world through organizations such as Education Above All, Qatar Charity, a government-licensed nongovernmental organization, would not work to undermine Qatar's formidable legacy in education.", "Moreover, since the blockade began, Qatar's Ministry of Education has taken a stance at home against sectarianism, removing any such references in its textbooks that originate from Wahabi teachings in Saudi Arabia.", "Thus, the purpose of this disinformation campaign is not a genuine concern for Qatar's work in Yemen. Instead, the goal is to advance the narrative that Qatar is actually colluding with Iran and its local surrogates against the West's interests.", "The Hadi government, which is ultimately Riyadh's surrogate in Yemen, levying such accusations not only factors into Saudi Arabia's current foreign policy aimed at ostracizing Qatar but also into a longer history of the kingdom fearing Qatari influence in Yemen.", "Seeing Qatar returning to Yemen albeit through humanitarian aid and being able to serve people on all sides of the conflict equally from a position of neutrality is hard for the kingdom to accept at a time when the Yemen war might be the biggest stain on Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's reputation, both domestically and internationally \u2013 by ANDREAS KRIEG and GIORGIO CAFIERO", "https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2019/11/11/could-education-in-yemen-be-new-proxy-battleground-in-the-gulf", "cp1a Am wichtigsten: Seuchen / Most important: Epidemics", "(* B H)", "Dengue fever started spreading quickly in some districts & villages in Western province of #Hodeidah. 41 people have been reported death in the last week due to epdmic outbreak.

The Riyadh Agreement seeks to put these differences to rest", "In reshaping the Yemeni cabinet and making it explicitly beholden to Saudi Arabia, the Riyadh Agreement could mean that President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi\u2019s decisions will no longer be dictated by his sons or his political ally, Yemen\u2019s Islah Party. Instead, Hadi and the STC have accepted that all major government actions be subordinated to Saudi Arabia. The STC, in an abrupt turn, also has accepted to be under an arrangement that explicitly endorses a unified Yemeni state, in so doing opening the door for its representatives to be present at any future United Nations-led peace talks to end the wider war. By staging a coup against the Yemeni government in Aden this past August, the STC has thus earned its place in the cabinet and international recognition, in another normalization of violence as a means to political ends.", "From a purely conflict resolution perspective, having more of the main belligerents represented at the table is good news.", "With the anti-Houthi side thus seemingly unifying under Saudi patronage, for better or worse, Riyadh now owns what happens, and what doesn\u2019t happen, in southern Yemen. While unwritten in the actual text, it would appear the new hierarchy the agreement envisions will specifically be headed by Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, who has quietly assumed responsibility for the Yemen file from his brother, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince and defense minister.", "Khalid bin Salman\u2019s vested interest in the agreement\u2019s success and the back-channel conversations between him and the Houthis which began in September, as reported by the Sana\u2019a Center, could foster the necessary matrix for a broader peace process in Yemen among all sides. It could allow Saudi Arabia to regain one thing it had in 2011, following the Yemeni uprising, and lost again in 2015 with the start of its military intervention in Yemen, which is the ability to be an umbrella over everyone to reach a peace deal in the country.", "A worst-case scenario for the Riyadh Agreement, however, is that it turns into a mass wedding but no one is quite sure who is meant to be married to whom, and chaos ensues. The vastness of the profound military and political reforms that the agreement calls for, the vagueness on the specifics regarding how these reforms should be undertaken and the hyperoptimistic time frame within which they should be completed leaves one to wonder if anything but chaos is possible.", "At best, the current Riyadh Agreement should thus be approached with cautious optimism.", "For the agreement to succeed Saudi Arabia cannot approach it as an end in itself, but as part of a larger effort to reconstitute the Yemeni government, end the conflict and bring about stability in its southern neighbor. Three steps to demonstrate this seriousness would be to: 1) put real money and resources into helping reform Yemeni government finances and economic practices, rather than just throwing money at the problem when it reaches a crisis point; 2) reopen Sana\u2019a Airport to commercial flights, beginning with medical evacuations for those with emergencies; 3) stop deporting hundreds of thousands of Yemeni laborers as part of the Saudi Vision 2030\u2019s aims for \u2018Saudization\u2019 of the labour force \u2013 in the years to come the loss of these remittances to Yemen, currently the country\u2019s largest source of foreign currency, will cause untold hardship and undoubtedly reignite socioeconomic instability and conflict.", "Whatever the outcome of the Riyadh Agreement, history will remember that Yemeni government and STC leaders alike smiled at the cameras and hailed the Riyadh Agreement as a triumph.

Reaching a national political settlement in Yemen will require both winding down the Saudi-led military intervention and bridging the gaping divides among the country\u2019s many armed groups and political factions. It is entirely possible that current negotiations will grind to a halt or fall apart. If that happens, the conflict will likely deepen and expand. Saudi Arabia and Iran will both intensify their struggle for influence, and Yemen will dissolve further into a mess of warring mini-states, each with its own international backer.", "The Saudis appear to have concluded that even if they can\u2019t beat the Houthis militarily, they must at least drive a wedge between the rebels and their Iranian backer with financial and political inducements. To succeed, however, they will need to win over or at least mitigate the influence of Houthi hard-liners while strengthening the hand of Houthi pragmatists by reducing the level of violence, delivering economic gains, and ultimately an end to cross-border hostilities.", "Saudi Arabia\u2019s interest in reviving talks with the Houthis was probably influenced by the UAE\u2019s recent decision to draw down its forces in Yemen.", "Combined, all of these developments form a pathway to a political settlement in Yemen, the most promising that diplomats and UN officials say they have seen in years.", "A LONG WAY TO GO", "A lot could still go wrong. A Houthi missile fired into Saudi Arabia that kills civilians, or a Saudi air strike that kills Yemeni civilians, could restart the cycle of violence. There is also a risk that Saudi Arabia will use the agreement between the STC and the Hadi government not to pursue peace talks but to ramp up the war effort against the Houthis. That is the fear of many diplomats and analysts, and the wish of some anti-Houthi groups and officials in Hadi\u2019s government.", "Just as tenuous is the Saudi-brokered deal between Hadi\u2019s government and the STC. Enmity between the two factions still runs high, and officials from both groups express pessimism over the agreement\u2019s durability.", "The deal is also vaguely worded and offers little guidance on implementation.", "There are also concerns about Riyadh\u2019s capacity to manage implementation of the accord. And given Riyadh\u2019s continued support for Hadi, some in the president\u2019s camp could conclude that they have the upper hand. If Hadi\u2019s government grows overconfident, it could provoke renewed fighting with the STC.", "Even if the southern power-sharing deal holds and the Saudi-Houthi de-escalation process stays on track, the road to durable peace in Yemen will be long and circuitous. Some five years of fighting have swept away large parts of the old order and changed the political landscape of the country.", "Much will turn on Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability and resolve to manage the two different strands of negotiations, and to eventually convince the Hadi government that it must sue for peace with the Houthis. But even as the Saudis facilitate intra-Yemeni negotiations, it is the Yemenis who will determine the outcome. A settlement to the swirling conflicts in Yemen is arguably closer now than at any point in the last five years, but that doesn\u2019t mean that peace is around the corner.

At the heart of the battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran is a four decade-old existential battle for dominance not only in the Middle East and North Africa but in the Muslim world as a whole. It is a battle that started with the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, the first toppling by a popular revolt of both a monarch and an icon of US power in the region.

The result has been Muslim societies like Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh have under Wahhabi and Salafi influence and the playing with religion by governments become more conservative.

Both countries claim to have leadership over other Islamic Muslim countries in the Middle East, in which Iran as a Shia state and Saudi Arabia as a Sunni-Wahhabi state have multiple ideological and political conflicts that have drawn opposing interests for each other. As a result, new multifactor regional international situation involving Iran and Saudi Arabia arose, to analyze which it would make sense to apply the general scientific analytical methods (logical, typological, inductive-deductive methods, etc.), and a number of specific methods for direct study of international relations, including those based on a systemic approach.
