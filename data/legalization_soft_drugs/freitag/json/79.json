It would reduce threats to Saudi Arabia and its oil infrastructure at a time of rising tensions with Iran. And it would open a door to wider de-escalation inside Yemen and possibly across the region.", "On Sept. 20, the Houthis\u2014who control northwestern Yemen and have been at war with a variety of Yemeni groups backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates since 2015\u2014announced a unilateral suspension of strikes on Saudi Arabia. In return, they asked for a halt to Saudi airstrikes and a lifting of restrictions on access to northern Yemen.", "Somewhat surprisingly, the Saudi response to Houthi overtures has been mostly positive. They have not suspended airstrikes but have reportedly reduced them in some areas. They have facilitated the entry of a number of fuel shipments into Houthi-controlled territory, albeit not enough to address the ongoing fuel crisis. The Houthis unilaterally released almost 300 prisoners, including three Saudis. Both sides have exchanged unusually positive public signals indicating interest in de-escalation, and they have reportedly reopened back-channel discussions.", "For Riyadh, ending the war in Yemen likely acquired new urgency in the wake of the Saudi Aramco attacks, which brought home the stakes of a hot war with Iran while piercing a gaping hole in the U.S. security umbrella. At a minimum, the Yemen war is a costly and dangerous distraction that keeps the Saudis focused south when attention could be directed elsewhere.", "It tests and uncovers the kingdom\u2019s military vulnerabilities and potentially allows Iran plausible deniability through the Houthis to launch attacks. And there are no easy military options for turning the tide against the Houthis. After the United Nations prevented an attack on the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida in December 2018, Saudi Arabia\u2019s main coalition partner, the UAE, redeployed its forces and now sees little point in continuing the effectively stalemated war in the north.", "This opportunity should be embraced, particularly by the United States, which has been complicit in Riyadh\u2019s war and could now encourage its Saudi allies to reach an understanding with the Houthis that includes significant reductions in cross-border attacks.", "If successful, this could serve as a foundation for a U.N.-brokered cease-fire agreement between Yemeni antagonists\u2014including the Houthis, the Yemeni government, and Emirati-backed southern separatists, among others\u2014and the resumption of intra-Yemeni negotiations to end the civil war. But the offer will not be on the table indefinitely.", "De-escalation overtures are fragile and easily reversible.
