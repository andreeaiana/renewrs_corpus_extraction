The Security Belt Forces were first established in Aden and then Abyan governorates to the exclusion of existing security and military institutions loyal to the Yemeni government chain of command. Rather than incorporate forces into a unified command, UAE-backed forces and brigades loyal to President Hadi have clashed on several occasions. This has encouraged both nominal allies to further empower their own loyalists, with Hadi notably empowering the Presidential Protection Brigades.", "As a result of the UAE\u2019s purported drawdown and the signing of the Riyadh Agreement between the STC and the government, Emirati funding has dried up for the Security Belt Forces, bringing the foreign-funded fighters to an almost inevitable crossroads: will they be incorporated fully into the Yemeni government\u2019s security and military institutions, or collapse and leave thousands of well-trained, unpaid and predominantly Salafi fighters vulnerable to recruitment by non-state actors?", "A halt to salary payments", "Security Belt Forces helped the STC push the government out of its interim capital in Aden in August 2019, taking control of swathes of neighboring governorates as well.", "The UAE formally transferred control of the interim capital to Saudi forces, although maintaining its influence over the STC, and in an apparent sign of a genuine drawdown in the country, has halted its salary payments to all Security Belt Forces personnel, continuing only to support individual leaders and commanders. For its part, the UAE argues it is merely acting in accordance with the Riyadh Agreement, while the government is arguing it should not be made responsible for salary payments unless authority has been transferred and it is exercising authority over the forces.", "In response, the unpaid fighters have begun taking measures into their own hands. After a couple months without pay, in early January the Security Belt Forces began levying taxes on transport trucks entering and leaving Aden, amounting to 20,000 Yemeni riyals (around $32) for each commercial vehicle departing Aden by road, and 15,000 riyals (around $24) for those entering the city. Several fighters have also begun protesting over the lack of salary payments.", "There are several barriers preventing the Yemeni and UAE governments to agree on this issue.", "Some of the fighters were only getting half or a fraction of their purported salaries, as commanders and other senior officials would pocket the rest. After the battle for Aden in August, the Yemeni government lost control of the Fourth Military Region, and as a result the government announced it was halting salary payments.", "Moreover, the fighters are demanding to receive the same amount the UAE was previously paying them, and there are several challenges surrounding this. The government pays in Yemeni riyals while the UAE was paying in Saudi riyals", "More fundamentally, however, it is clear that without a large influx of foreign assistance, the Yemeni government does not have the funds to employ the armed groups created by the UAE. Prior to the ongoing national conflict, the government paid salaries to about 400,000 troops across all of Yemen, and already struggled to do so at the time. Now, the Fourth Military Region \u2013 one of seven military divisions across the country \u2013 includes almost 400,000 registered troops alone. Moreover, the vast majority of those soldiers are not engaged in the conflict against the Houthis, and thus the government would prioritize funding to other military regions.", "Vulnerable to recruitment", "After the dust settled in Aden and Abyan from the localized battle against the Houthis, the UAE funded and equipped paramilitary bodies across much of the south, including the Security Belt Forces in Abyan. The state military and security institutions were sidelined, and remain weak and largely ineffective. Security Belt Forces have conducted counter-terrorism operations against AQAP in Abyan and reduced their public footprint, but at the same time heavy-handed crackdowns against civilians in Abyan have caused resentment amongst many locals toward the SBF and its external sponsor.", "There are concerns that AQAP may be able to feed off of local anger toward the security forces, and that without proper integration either into state institutions or back into civilian life \u2013 including much needed financial support from regional countries \u2013 AQAP and other criminal groups will be able to recruit from among its ranks. This is particularly the case given the UAE has largely employed fighters with similar religious leanings, who now have weapons training and combat experience.", "With the Riyadh Agreement stalling on several issues, it remains to be seen how the Security Belt Forces fit into the equation. However, given the financial obstacles and the continued discord between the Yemeni and Emirati governments, there is an acute risk of further clashes and instability in Aden, Abyan, and beyond.", "https://al-masdaronline.net/national/300", "(** B K P)", "Weapons Trafficking Fuels Conflicts in Yemen and Africa", "The war in Yemen has left the country flooded with weapons, many of which are being diverted to local militias and elsewhere regionally, to boost the war economy. Little has been done to regulate the unauthorized arms flow within the country.", "Years of conflict from domestic and external actors have greatly destabilized Yemen. Yet one of the less-mentioned factors that are driving the conflict is that of arms trafficking within and outside of the country even as various Western-supplied weapons have played a controversial role in Yemen\u2019s swelling arms market.", "Before the current civil war, smuggling arms into Yemen was a profitable business for organized networks. Traditional routes had come in through the West such as al-Mokha\u2019s port. Larger and more organized smuggling networks had trafficked weapons through the eastern Mahra province\u2014bordering Oman, then transited through the central Marib province to be delivered to local arms dealers.", "Mohammad, a resident from Sanaa\u2019, told Inside Arabia that \u201ccarrying arms in Yemen is an ancient tribal habit; Yemenis are proud of weapons and they wear [them] everywhere, so there are weapons markets available almost everywhere in Yemen.\u201d", "\u201cBut the weapons trade has increased more than 300% compared to before the war as many markets emerged in new cities that didn\u2019t have them before the war, such as Taiz and Aden for example.\u201d", "There have been heavy weapons and tanks sold in the arms markets too, he added, which has become a large part of the war economy.", "Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who are heavily stocked with Western-supplied weapons, have flooded the country with arms since intervening in March 2015 to reinstate the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, backing several local militias and armed forces fighting for the anti-Houthi coalition.", "Much of this military equipment however has been diverted through third-party transfers for several reasons. Either allied factions may have dual-loyalties, or government soldiers have often sold them to local markets or other factions, to boost their appalling salaries. Several investigations have seen these weapons end up in the \u201cwrong hands.\u201d", "Weapons shops that have widely proliferated in Yemen have not only been used for individual trade, militia factions have also placed larger orders on weapons, leading to a soaring demand for them.", "Ahmed Himmiche, who had coordinated a panel of experts on Yemen, said there are fighters outside the Yemeni government\u2019s control who \u201creceive military support, including weapons, which then end up on the black market or in the hands of entities under sanction.\u201d", "Due to the lack of controls on weapons moving across Yemen, Western arms delivered to coalition forces have unexpectedly ended up on the market and in the hands of extremists, as documented in a CNN investigation last year.", "Taiz city has been engulfed in a power struggle involving various factions, mainly government-aligned forces, the Houthis, al-Islah militias, and even hard-line Salafi militants.", "Among weapons markets in Taiz, Western weapons are readily displayed. \u201cAmerican guns are expensive and sought after,\u201d said one weapons trader.", "The militia of Abu al-Abbas, who was designated as a terrorist by the United States in 2017 for his Al Qaeda ties, has been seen possessing U.S.-made Oshkosh armored vehicles.", "The UAE-backed Giants Brigade, a Salafi organization in the anti-Houthi campaign operating in the western Al-Hudaydah area, has discarded much U.S.-made weaponry on which it had left its insignia. These include many Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles with the Giants Brigade insignia, according to the investigation.", "Speaking to Inside Arabia, Michael Horton, researcher at the Jamestown Foundation, said that coalition-supplied weapons had even ended up in Houthi hands, evidently backfiring on Saudi Arabia\u2019s military efforts \u2013 by Jonathan Fenton-Harvey", "https://insidearabia.com/weapons-trafficking-fuels-conflicts-in-yemen-and-africa/", "(** B K P)", "Die H\u00f6lle zu unserem Vorteil lenken", "Wenn die Mainstream-Medien \u00fcber den Krieg schreiben, auch kritisch, dann ist das Bild, das mir oft in den Sinn kommt, ein in Plastik eingewickelter S\u00e4ugling.

I was struck yet again by the way every single U.S. military intervention in the Greater Middle East since 9/11 has backfired in wildly counterproductive ways, destabilizing a vast expanse of the planet stretching from West Africa to South Asia.", "Chaos, it seems, is now Washington\u2019s stock-in-trade.

Still, that and Trump\u2019s other recent escalations in the region do illustrate an American chaos machine that\u2019s gone off the rails.

So it is that, from Mali to Libya, Syria to Afghanistan, every one of Bush\u2019s and Obama\u2019s military forays has sowed further chaos, startling body counts, and increased rates of terrorism.

The Security Belt Forces were first established in Aden and then Abyan governorates to the exclusion of existing security and military institutions loyal to the Yemeni government chain of command. Rather than incorporate forces into a unified command, UAE-backed forces and brigades loyal to President Hadi have clashed on several occasions. This has encouraged both nominal allies to further empower their own loyalists, with Hadi notably empowering the Presidential Protection Brigades.", "As a result of the UAE\u2019s purported drawdown and the signing of the Riyadh Agreement between the STC and the government, Emirati funding has dried up for the Security Belt Forces, bringing the foreign-funded fighters to an almost inevitable crossroads: will they be incorporated fully into the Yemeni government\u2019s security and military institutions, or collapse and leave thousands of well-trained, unpaid and predominantly Salafi fighters vulnerable to recruitment by non-state actors?", "A halt to salary payments", "Security Belt Forces helped the STC push the government out of its interim capital in Aden in August 2019, taking control of swathes of neighboring governorates as well.", "The UAE formally transferred control of the interim capital to Saudi forces, although maintaining its influence over the STC, and in an apparent sign of a genuine drawdown in the country, has halted its salary payments to all Security Belt Forces personnel, continuing only to support individual leaders and commanders. For its part, the UAE argues it is merely acting in accordance with the Riyadh Agreement, while the government is arguing it should not be made responsible for salary payments unless authority has been transferred and it is exercising authority over the forces.", "In response, the unpaid fighters have begun taking measures into their own hands. After a couple months without pay, in early January the Security Belt Forces began levying taxes on transport trucks entering and leaving Aden, amounting to 20,000 Yemeni riyals (around $32) for each commercial vehicle departing Aden by road, and 15,000 riyals (around $24) for those entering the city. Several fighters have also begun protesting over the lack of salary payments.", "There are several barriers preventing the Yemeni and UAE governments to agree on this issue.", "Some of the fighters were only getting half or a fraction of their purported salaries, as commanders and other senior officials would pocket the rest. After the battle for Aden in August, the Yemeni government lost control of the Fourth Military Region, and as a result the government announced it was halting salary payments.", "Moreover, the fighters are demanding to receive the same amount the UAE was previously paying them, and there are several challenges surrounding this. The government pays in Yemeni riyals while the UAE was paying in Saudi riyals", "More fundamentally, however, it is clear that without a large influx of foreign assistance, the Yemeni government does not have the funds to employ the armed groups created by the UAE. Prior to the ongoing national conflict, the government paid salaries to about 400,000 troops across all of Yemen, and already struggled to do so at the time. Now, the Fourth Military Region \u2013 one of seven military divisions across the country \u2013 includes almost 400,000 registered troops alone. Moreover, the vast majority of those soldiers are not engaged in the conflict against the Houthis, and thus the government would prioritize funding to other military regions.", "Vulnerable to recruitment", "After the dust settled in Aden and Abyan from the localized battle against the Houthis, the UAE funded and equipped paramilitary bodies across much of the south, including the Security Belt Forces in Abyan. The state military and security institutions were sidelined, and remain weak and largely ineffective. Security Belt Forces have conducted counter-terrorism operations against AQAP in Abyan and reduced their public footprint, but at the same time heavy-handed crackdowns against civilians in Abyan have caused resentment amongst many locals toward the SBF and its external sponsor.", "There are concerns that AQAP may be able to feed off of local anger toward the security forces, and that without proper integration either into state institutions or back into civilian life \u2013 including much needed financial support from regional countries \u2013 AQAP and other criminal groups will be able to recruit from among its ranks. This is particularly the case given the UAE has largely employed fighters with similar religious leanings, who now have weapons training and combat experience.", "With the Riyadh Agreement stalling on several issues, it remains to be seen how the Security Belt Forces fit into the equation.
