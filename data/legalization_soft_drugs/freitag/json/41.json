This has made the war\u2019s continuation \u201ccriminal\u201d while also chalking up a win for Tehran.", "In his conversation with Sana\u2019a Center staff, Al-Iryani also discusses how southern Yemen marches to its own drum and why the recent Riyadh Agreement is a \u201cpowder keg\u201d waiting to blow. He then speaks to how the UAE has behaved like a \u201ckid in a candy shop\u201d in Yemen, lavishing aid and favors upon Salafis who could easily become the next support base for anyone from the Islah party to Al-Qaeda.", "Sana\u2019a Center: Why is Yemen at war?", "Abdulghani Al-Iryani: Yemenis do not agree on the root cause of conflict, so I can only give you my take on why Yemenis are fighting. The way I see it, this is just one more cycle of competition between northern Zaidi tribal elites and the rest of Yemen over power. This has been a cyclical social negotiation process surfacing throughout the country\u2019s history", "In effect, today, the Houthis have reconstituted Saleh\u2019s regime without Saleh. They took control of state institutions, established alliances with tribal sheikhs and co-opted what is left of the GPC and their power arrangements. So, in short, while on the face of it this conflict is political, at its root it is an identity conflict, with these demographic blocks competing, fighting or making alliances.", "The south of Yemen has not really been part of this process of social negotiation. That\u2019s why the south tends to behave in its own way \u2013 not quite consistent with the central dynamic of the Yemen conflict. In essence, the conflict in the south is even more identity-based \u2013 between what is referred to as the \u201cBedouins,\u201d represented by President Hadi and his allies, and those Tribesmen represented by the Southern Transitional Council (STC).", "Then the regional dimension comes in.", "It was clear that one of the main reasons behind the war in Yemen was related to a Saudi internal affair and when this domestic justification ceased to exist, MBS did not have the time to stop it. Then other things [came into the picture] like the economy of the war. There\u2019s also a wing in Saudi Arabia which to this day is still thinking about [annexing] Hadramawt and Mahra or getting extraterritorial rights in them. Saudi Arabia only put up a serious effort at winning the war until 2016 when the Kuwait peace negotiations started. When these negotiations failed, serious Saudi effort at winning the war was never resumed.", "What is the current status of peace negotiations?", "AA: The UN is now pursuing further negotiations, mostly in connection with the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement. But we have to accept the fact that the UN is a tool: the UN will not make peace, Yemenis will make peace. If the parties are serious about advancing towards peace, then the UN is a useful tool to work out areas of interest for negotiation. If one side is not interested in peace, then no matter how smart the special envoy is, the UN can do nothing. No one can force a peace agreement on anyone.", "I think we\u2019re now at a point where peace would actually be feasible to pursue. The obstacles that stood in the way of peace are falling one by one. The war economy was one of the key obstacles, but over the past few months, maybe a year, the income from it has been going down.", "I think the face-saving exit is not going to happen on the battlefield \u2013 Saudi Arabia has demonstrated incompetence over and over again. The only way is the political way \u2013 some kind of political production to give them a face-saving exit. Without that I think they will keep the conflict going \u2013 maybe even increase its intensity, leading to a lot more bloodshed. But there is no way that they can change the outcome \u2013 they have shown that they are unable to beat the Houthis militarily.", "Which party currently has the upper hand in the war?", "AA: I think the Houthis, and by association Iran, have won the war, and their victory is irreversible. Some will disagree but I say that because of the following: They are in full control of Yemeni state institutions. They have reconstituted a political elite deal that has governed Yemen for decades. They control the majority of the population. They are in a position to speak for the people of Yemen, while the internationally recognized government has been displaced and losing credibility over the years. They are now the voice of the northern Zaidi demographic and people turn to them to maintain their interests.", "So we have one side that controls the Yemeni state and another side that is unable to implement anything. The internationally recognized government has lost its base in the south and been unable to build institutions to compete with those controlled by the Houthis. It has lost credibility in the eyes of the population, who see the government as a willing participant in the weaponizing of the economy against the population. The government is blamed for not opening Sana\u2019a airport. It is blamed for obstacles placed on the import of petroleum products, food and basic commodities. It is blamed for having transferred the central bank to Aden and promising to pay salaries for all [public sector employees], then not paying salaries. So, the general population will give them no legitimacy. Now the government\u2019s legitimacy comes from the UN Security Council, then the UN Security Council can take it away at any time \u2013 and the government will have nothing left.", "So now that the Houthis have won, the continuation of war is not only unconscionable but also criminal. On Hadi\u2019s side, there are a lot of people who know that their careers will end with the end of the war.", "Unfortunately, the course of negotiation the special envoy is now pursuing is going to lead to a dead end. I think he, and really all of us, should start thinking of a new modality that is implementable. We need to recognize that the most we can get out of negotiations is to freeze and formalize the existing state of affairs so that every party controls and manages areas and population they are currently controlling. We need to formalize that control, foster coordination between these different groups so that the national institutions that have been divided into two or three pieces can be restored.", "Do the parties trust the UN?", "AA: The Houthis do not trust the UN.", "The internationally recognized government, on the other hand, has only the UN to give it legitimacy \u2013 so of course, they trust the UN. They know the UN is doing its best to help them return to Sana\u2019a. Saudi Arabia can exercise undue influence on what the UN does for a variety of reasons. It has excellent relations with permanent members of the UNSC. It also has various points of leverage: if it wants to harass the UN, it can withhold licenses for UN flights to Sana\u2019a, for example. It can refuse to finance the special mission and other UN activities. There are many ways Saudi Arabia can make life for the UN difficult. These tools are not available to the other side. So the UN is not neutral in this conflict \u2013 it cannot be for very pragmatic reasons.", "You referred there to UN Security Council Resolution 2216 \u2013 adopted in 2015 \u2013 which essentially enshrines the legitimacy of the Hadi government. Does the resolution still have a role to play?", "AA: Resolution 2216 was issued after the Houthis took control of Sana\u2019a. Its purpose was to deter them, force them to back down following the coup and make them return to the political process. It did not achieve this desired purpose and after a few months it lost its utility, so there is a need for a new, more balanced and more realistic resolution to deal with the Houthis.", "Since then and until this day, Resolution 2216 was negatively used. The Saudis used it to prolong the war. When the international community pressured Saudi Arabia to stop the war, it would say \u201cwe are ready [to do so], but the Houthis must implement Resolution 2216,\u201d i.e. withdraw from Sana\u2019a, hand over weapons and return to Sa\u2019ada, then agreements can then be reached.", "These impossible conditions were [applied] and used to prolong the war for years. Despite that, the main beneficiary from Resolution 2216 was the most competent party: the Houthis. Resolution 2216\u2019s validity ended four years ago, and the international community is still thinking of issuing a new resolution. Look, it\u2019s true that the [UN special] envoy has a role but, in the end, the Americans and British decide everything. They make the decisions with their eye on Saudi Arabia. They decide on [the] condition [that] they do not upset Saudi Arabia. And in the end, Saudi desire is what directs international decisions pertaining to Yemen. Meaning, no one is willing to make a decision that may cause Boeing to lose a $20 billion deal to Airbus.", "Tell us more about Islah. What is it?", "AA: Look, Islah is a tribe before it\u2019s anything else \u2013 it was a Zaidi tribe. Notice how all of Islah\u2019s main leaders have Zaidi origins and a Zaidi identity \u2013 the identity which I call the northern Zaidi tribal identity. Zaidiyyah as a [social] identity and not a [religious] sect. The aim of the uprising in 2011 was to end the northern Zaidi tribal monopoly of power. They [Islah] came and hijacked this revolution, and they were practically trying to turn the matter into [a question of] who will replace Ali Abdullah Saleh. [For Islah] this was to be Hamid al-Ahmar [a senior Islah MP, powerful businessman and sheikh from the highly influential Hashid tribal federation], recycling the northern tribal elite instead of including the rest of the society.", "This is why they lost their popular base, and the people, whether the Zaidi street or the rest of Yemen, viewed them as [hijackers] who are removing Ali Abdullah Saleh\u2019s regime and replacing it with the ugly side of Ali Abdullah Saleh\u2019s regime.", "Is there a sense of identity-driven hatred in Yemen?", "AA: Divisions are identity-based and politically expressed, but this is not hatred. The divisions are based on interests rather than animosity.", "What about the relationship between Iran and the Houthis? How do we square this with the Saudi-Houthi talks?", "AA: Iran sends the Houthis regular shipments of petroleum products \u2013 the estimated value of that is maybe $200-250 million a year. But this is only a small contribution to the Houthis\u2019 total revenue. Iran also gives the Houthis political advice, military training, and there are at least 5,000 students studying in Iran at any one time. We know they occasionally send missile parts or missiles \u2013 but the type of weaponry they use is actually available on the black market. If Iran doesn\u2019t want to get implicated then they don\u2019t need to send missiles. One of the members of the Houthi cabinet is a famous arms dealer named on a UN list \u2013 he has the network to provide weapons from anywhere in the world.", "The ideological link is very difficult to estimate but it is there. There is co-dependence and mutual interest. The Houthis are not proxy of Iran or a pawn \u2013 they have their own agenda. They are a local force with a local agenda. They are allied with Iran but not subject to its influence the way that is advertised. Iran does not actually have the kind of leverage over the Houthis that everyone talks about.", "https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9246", "My comment: A very long and interesting interview, dealing with very many subjects.", "and", "(** B K P)", "Ending the war in Yemen: Q&A with Abdulghani al-Iryani", "To better understand why and whether there is a way for the war to end, the Global Observatory spoke with Abdulghani al-Iryani, a senior researcher at the Sana\u2019a Center for Strategic Studies, where he focuses on the peace process, conflict analysis, and transformations of the Yemeni state", "Mr. Al-Iryani: We have basically come towards the end of the conflict, and the question should be \u201cwhy is it still going?\u201d It is continuing for two reasons mostly. One is the war economy. People from all sides are making lots of money out of this conflict, including some front-line officials of the Arab Coalition. They have no interest in bringing this conflict to an end.", "The second reason is because the Saudis and the Houthis\u2014Ansar Allah\u2014have not been able to come to an agreement on the kind of long-term relationship they should have.", "Clearly, none of the stated goals of the international armed coalition at the beginning of the conflict have been achieved. On the one hand, Ansar Allah has been able to withstand all the pressure and take over the state institutions. On the other hand, the internationally-recognized government has been able to make itself irrelevant both by its incompetence, corruption, and by its inability to respond to the needs of its people.", "In this context it is hard for me to see the benefit or purpose of renewed sanctions, which usually affect the population more than they do those who control the population. In my view, it is useless. It serves no apparent interest if that interest is to bring this war to an end.", "For the Saudis, clearly they are fully involved. They are actually fighting and I think that, while they were interested in ending the conflict early on, since the failure of the Kuwait negotiations and peace talks in 2016, they have kept the war at a low level and made no effort to bring it to an end. In the meantime, they have used it to mobilize and agitate against Iran. Of course, Ansar Allah were the main beneficiary of this strategy.", "As far as Iran is concerned, I think their role in Yemen is very limited. It was very limited in the beginning, and it remains limited now. But as the conflict continues, Ansar Allah is being pushed against their will to the side of the Iranians because of their need for new defense technology.", "Ansar Allah has made an effort to stay away from Iran because they realize that their long-term interest is in having good relations with Saudi Arabia. They come from a part of Yemen which has always been connected to the Saudi economy. All their produce was sold in Saudi Arabia, all the imports that came to them came from Saudi Arabia. The currency of trade in their areas is the Saudi riyal not the Yemeni riyal. Their social relations are more connected to the Saudi side than they are to the Yemeni side.", "A normal situation for Ansar Allah and Saudi Arabia is good neighborly relations. This situation of antagonism is an aberration. I think they both realize that they need to work out a cooperative relationship. As long they don\u2019t, Iran benefits. Iran did not actively seek to establish a foothold in Yemen. It was the mismanagement of the Saada conflict from 2004 onwards that gave Iran that foothold with minimum investment on their part.", "The Stockholm Agreement is an entry point to a larger national ceasefire and return to peace. It would be useful for all the articles of the Stockholm Agreement to be implemented, but it is not necessary.", "I think both the Saudis and the Ansar Allah know exactly how this needs to be done. They are talking, and when they started talking they told the United Nations they do not need any help.", "One obstacle that stands in the way is that the Saudis are still clinging to the objective of bringing [President Abdrabbuh Mansur] Hadi back to Sana\u2019a. It is clear that this is not going to happen and the Saudis are hesitant to appear as if they have failed to achieve their objectives. They need a face-saving exit, one where they agree with the Ansar Allah in a way that makes them look better.", "Another factor is that Ansar Allah is factionalized. There is a militant faction that would not like to see this war come to an end.", "https://theglobalobservatory.org/2020/03/ending-war-yemen-qa-abdulghani-al-iryani/", "(** B K)", "Film: Inside Yemen's dangerously divided 'city of snipers", "Taiz, in Yemen's south-west, is home to one of the longest-running battles of the country's civil war.", "Known as the city of snipers, Taiz - divided between the Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the government - is constantly under siege.", "Saudi air-strikes have continued since the start of the war in 2015 and the people of Taiz say they feel forgotten.", "The BBC gained exclusive access to see what life is like for those living on the government controlled side of this divided city", "https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-51806821/inside-yemen-s-dangerously-divided-city-of-snipers = https://www.cbsnews.com/live/video/20200311104034-inside-yemens-dangerous-city-of-snipers/", "(** B K P)", "\u2018Mutual Extortion Racket:\u2019 How Defense Manufacturers Influence US Foreign Policy", "As the humanitarian toll [in the Yemen war] continues to climb, the administration of President Donald Trump has faced growing pressure to end U.S. support for the war.", "In a historic vote in April 2019, the U.S. Congress passed a War Powers Resolution directing Trump to end U.S. involvement in the conflict. Three months later, lawmakers passed a series of resolutions blocking arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.", "But both measures faced staunch opposition from the American defense manufacturing industry, which stood to lose billions of dollars if Washington cut support to the coalition. The resolutions were ultimately vetoed by Trump and both override efforts failed in the Senate.", "In a new report titled \u201cA Mutual Extortion Racket: The Military Industrial Complex and U.S. Foreign Policy \u2013 The Case of Saudi Arabia and UAE,\u201d Transparency International\u2019s Jodi Vittori documents how the American defense manufacturing industry has been able to exert influence on U.S. foreign policy decisions, particularity on Yemen.", "As the war grinds on, The Globe Post\u2019s Bryan Bowman spoke with Vittori about the many \u201cpathways to influence\u201d used by the defense industry to ensure its ability to continue to export arms to the coalition, even in the face of significant bipartisan opposition.", "Vittori: I often see people look at how the defense industry, through lobbyists, PR firms and so forth, influences Congress and it\u2019s a one way arrow. And that\u2019s not really the case. That\u2019s especially not the case when we deal with the defense industry as a defense export industry in particular, which is a very unique sector, I think, in the American economy. So I really wanted to take what he worked with, but really expand on it for this unique sector.", "Bowman: In the executive summary, you write the report \u201cexamines how the US defense industry uses a combination of pathways to influence the American federal government to ensure the ability to export to countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\u201d What are those pathways of influence and what are a couple of examples of how they\u2019ve been used in recent years?", "Vittori: Absolutely. So this is a somewhat different project for transparency than normal, because we usually were focused very, very narrowly on corruption as focused on illegality.", "So we looked at corruption. But we also looked at other defense pathways that can pull U.S. foreign policy as it relates to arms exports away from what one could argue is in the best interests of U.S. foreign policy and international peace overall.", "One of them, of course, is lobbying. Elections are incredibly expensive in the United States, as we\u2019re watching as we go through the presidential and congressional elections. It takes a lot of campaign donations to be able to run for office", "It\u2019s very, very difficult to track dark money.", "Then we looked at the revolving door, and this is based off the incredible work that the Project on Government Oversight has done. We often focus on a revolving door with members of Congress and their staffs. And this has been extensively studied. There\u2019s a lot of very strong empirical evidence that supports the fact that staffers are primarily hired for their access and less for the information expertise that they provide.", "That\u2019s just as true in the defense industry, but often neglected, as is the role that senior military officers and senior Department of Defense and State Department officials can play in the revolving door and how loose those rules are.", "Just as an example, General [James] Mattis was on the board of General Dynamics. He left the board and became the secretary of defense and is now already back on the board.", "This whole senior officers running senior defense firm stuff, this is a relatively recent situation. And it can have tremendous impacts both on the defense establishment and, frankly, the morale of the younger troops underneath them if those troops are concerned that those officers are looking out more for their future careers and less about getting them the best equipment and services that they need to do their missions.", "Then we also note the lack of controls for former military officers and others to go work for foreign countries. That\u2019s less common but it does happen.", "Bowman: You note in the report that \u201cfew recent cases exemplify this cycle as clearly as the war in Yemen,\u201d which is causing what the U.N. deems the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. How specifically has the US defense export sector sought to influence the government to maintain its support for the Saudi coalition fighting there, even in the face of mounting opposition within Congress and growing pressure from the international community to end the war?", "Vittori: Certainly. It basically runs the gamut across all of the pathways of influence. We noted, obviously, significant lobbying of both Republicans and Democrats to maintain those defense exports going forward. And campaign finance goes with it.", "And then there\u2019s the revolving door jobs. I\u2019ll just pick on Secretary Mattis again. When he was secretary, he was writing to Senators and Congressmen, saying don\u2019t restrict our ability to export these weapons. I have no indications of what he\u2019s done since he\u2019s gone back on General Dynamic\u2019s board. But I\u2019m sure they\u2019re quite pleased that somebody supported continued UAE exports on their board.", "Then there\u2019s soft influence. We document a number of cases, for example, with defense advisory boards and even think tanks. There was a a leak of the UAE ambassador\u2019s emails that documented a lot of things, including some questionable offsets given by U.S. companies that filter back in the U.S. to influence drone exports, for example. And also just significant money given to think tanks that helped support, for example, drone exports as well. Those think tanks argue that they were not engaged in lobbying. But they did things like set up roundtables with defense experts that could potentially help influence U.S. foreign policy on those issues.", "So it\u2019s not just one thing, and that\u2019s what the empirical evidence shows as well. It\u2019s not just lobbying or just revolving door. When all of these work together in concert they are far more effective.", "But defense industry lobbyists often go to members of Congress and talk about how many jobs are in their districts. I was able to interview a defense analyst who wishes to remain anonymous and he made it very clear that when they are lobbying Congress, their goal is to focus just on jobs and not focus on the larger foreign policy concerns. They keep the conversation very, very narrow, because often there are very, very large foreign policy concerns with defense exports \u2013 future blowback, diversion of goods, and so forth.", "In terms of Yemen and the exports to the UAE and Yemen, there are a lot of reasons countries decide to import weapons from a country like the U.S. One is national security. But believe it or not, that is often not the main reason. A primary reason might be to remain under the security blanket of a key ally. So a lot of the reason that Saudi Arabia and the UAE purchased weapons over the years is that they\u2019re very weak countries. And this helps keep them under the U.S. security umbrella.", "And it also allows for regime survival.", "One of the reasons that the United States was always happy to sell, frankly, was they never thought Saudi Arabia was really going to use most of the stuff. It was fairly safe. They were going to buy lots of stuff and make lots of American jobs. It was an easy export. Make lots of money. Keep the security umbrella going. Everybody was happy. But lo and behold, in Yemen they start using the stuff.

To illustrate these pathways of influence, this report provides examples such as key lobbying firms associated with a former member of the House Armed Services Committee and lobbyists with the Trump presidential campaign. It will assess how some recently retired senior military officers now work for the defense industry in MENA-related lobbying jobs, and even one case where a former Army officer joined the Emirati military, leading their helicopter forces there. This report will include examples such as the UAE\u2019s role in using an American private security company as a possible intermediary to push for policy change vis-\u00e0-vis US foreign policy with Qatar and Saudi Arabia\u2019s aggressive lobbying to limit censure for conduct in the conflict in Yemen.", "Beyond the sheer size of the sector, American defense export companies exhibit unique characteristics that make this economic sector especially important for scrutiny. First, the sector provides vital equipment and services to the United States and those of MENA regimes essential to their national security; without these goods and services, the United States would lack the military pillar of American foreign policy. American defense goods exported to MENA regimes are often key aspects of their own internal security as well as placing them firmly under the American defense umbrella against their external enemies. The fact that key defense components such as fighter aircraft and naval ships are often produced by one or a few firms, along with the significant control exercised by the United States federal government as the primary customer for most defense goods and its role in approving nearly all defense exports means that the defense sector and US government are intertwined in ways not exhibited in other export sectors.", "The MENA region is an especially important export customer for American defense firms. MENA is considered one of the most militarized regions in the world, with six out of the ten top ten defense budgets as a percentage of GDP found there.", "This report documents how these unique characteristics of the US defense export sector are intertwined with key pathways for influence vis-\u00e0-vis the US federal government in order for the defense export sector to ensure a relatively open legislative and regulatory environment to continue to export to the Middle East. Rarely is only one pathway used for influence by the defense sector; they are often intermingled to magnify influence towards desired policy outcomes. The pathways analyzed here are:", "Lobbying. Lobbying is any oral or written communication to influence executive and legislative branch officials on behalf of a client to formulate, modify, or adopt certain legislation, regulations, or policies of the US government. The defense sector runs extensive in-house lobbying activities as well as hiring outside lobbying firms, public relations firms, and consultants in order to help influence the US federal government towards defense export-friendly policies.", "Campaign Finance. Running for and staying in office is exceptionally expensive, and the defense industry is able to make significant campaign contributions, especially for elected officials on important Congressional committees or representing key defense firms in their districts. The role of so-called \u201cdark money,\u201d where money is donated theoretically separate from individual political campaigns by anonymous donors, including those in the defense sector, are especially pernicious. As a result, the US defense export sector is able to use its campaign contributions to not only ensure a relatively benign export environment, but perhaps more importantly, to prevent significant reforms unfavorable to the industry, for while there may be only one way to pass a Congressional bill, there are many ways to kill an unfavorable one.", "Revolving Door. This refers to high-level government employees, including members of Congress and their staffs, senior military personnel, and other members of the executive branch rotating to senior jobs in industry or lobbying-associated activities. It can also refer to industry leaders rotating into senior governmental jobs, usually on a relatively short-term basis of a few years, where they have the potential to make decisions that can affect their companies\u2019 interests. Empirical studies demonstrate that it is often access to government officials and insider knowledge rather than expertise in a particular policy arena that leads to these hiring decisions.", "This is especially common in national security-related work: the Project on Government Oversight found that in 2018 alone, there were at least 645 instances where the top 20 defense contractors hired former government officials, military officers, members of Congress, and senior legislative staff to be lobbyists, board members, or senior executives.", "Defense Offsets. These are provisions in foreign government defense procurement contracts that promise specific benefits to the contracting country as a condition for purchasing defense goods and services from a non-domestic supplier such as an American defense firm; in short, they are side deals and sweeteners for countries who purchase American defense goods. US defense contractors typically enter into an average of 30 to 60 offset agreements representing $3 to $7 billion in obligations each year. These contracts are a notorious conduit for corruption. Saudi Arabia and the UAE require defense offset contracts as part of defense deals, while keeping both the deals themselves and the beneficial owners of the firms associated with them secret. Thus, defense offset deals in these countries exhibit significant red flags for potentially corrupt activity. One such offset deal funneled cash from American arms contracts to the UAE government who then funneled it through a local think tank to an American one to conduct research and advocacy activities that supported loosening drone exports to the UAE.", "\u201cSoft\u201d Influence. These include defense industry funding of think tanks, media campaigns, and academic work that supports industry policies and goals. These methods of influence are not necessarily bad, but they can reinforce other pathways of influence in ways that benefit the defense industry but can hurt American foreign policy or national security interests. Soft influence includes the influence companies can gain from sitting on various policies boards, such as the Defense Policy Board, which provides advice on long term and enduring issues of defense planning as well as research and analysis on topics assigned by the Defense Secretary or his senior staff. That the board members provide advice on policies that have a direct financial bearing on their companies can be a conflict of interest. In some cases, former senior military leaders, once they left the service, have joined senior positions of defense companies and then also sat on the Defense Policy Board while at the same time enjoying fellowships with leading think tanks, demonstrating the overlapping aspects of the revolving door and soft influence.", "Corruption.", "https://ti-defence.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/US_Defense_Industry_Influence_Paper_v4_digital_singlePage.pdf", "(** A K)", "US-Marines im Jemen", "Die USA schickt Soldaten in den Jemen: Auf der jemenitischen, von den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten besetzten Insel Sokotra trafen in diesen Tagen weitere US-Milit\u00e4rs ein, Patriot-Raketensysteme sind schon errichtet.", "Die jemenitische Nachrichten-Website sanapostnews.com meldet:", "\u201eEine neue Gruppe aus dem Marinekorps der Vereinigten Staaten traf am Samstag auf der Insel Sokotra ein, nachdem die Patriot-Systeme installiert worden waren, wie lokale Quellen berichten.\u201c", "http://blauerbote.com/2020/03/10/us-marines-im-jemen/", "(** A K)", "US marines arrive on Yemen\u2019s Socotra to support UAE forces", "A new batch of US Marines arrived on the Yemeni island of Socotra on Saturday, according to local sources, installing Patriot defence systems.", "Sanaa Post reported that the American soldiers were received by the \u201coccupying\u201d UAE forces at their headquarters on the island.", "There is speculation that the US intends to establish its own military base amid reports that America had sent military experts to equip observation points to deploy radars and air defence points on the strategically located island overlooking the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.", "US forces had previously arrived on Socotra in December of last year and reportedly started installing a Patriot missile system in order to protect the Saudi and Emirati forces on the island at the time.", "According to the sources, on 21 December of last year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman ordered the UN-recognised, exiled Yemeni government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi to lease the entire island to the UAE for a period of about 95 years.

This has made the war\u2019s continuation \u201ccriminal\u201d while also chalking up a win for Tehran.", "In his conversation with Sana\u2019a Center staff, Al-Iryani also discusses how southern Yemen marches to its own drum and why the recent Riyadh Agreement is a \u201cpowder keg\u201d waiting to blow. He then speaks to how the UAE has behaved like a \u201ckid in a candy shop\u201d in Yemen, lavishing aid and favors upon Salafis who could easily become the next support base for anyone from the Islah party to Al-Qaeda.", "Sana\u2019a Center: Why is Yemen at war?", "Abdulghani Al-Iryani: Yemenis do not agree on the root cause of conflict, so I can only give you my take on why Yemenis are fighting. The way I see it, this is just one more cycle of competition between northern Zaidi tribal elites and the rest of Yemen over power. This has been a cyclical social negotiation process surfacing throughout the country\u2019s history", "In effect, today, the Houthis have reconstituted Saleh\u2019s regime without Saleh. They took control of state institutions, established alliances with tribal sheikhs and co-opted what is left of the GPC and their power arrangements. So, in short, while on the face of it this conflict is political, at its root it is an identity conflict, with these demographic blocks competing, fighting or making alliances.", "The south of Yemen has not really been part of this process of social negotiation. That\u2019s why the south tends to behave in its own way \u2013 not quite consistent with the central dynamic of the Yemen conflict. In essence, the conflict in the south is even more identity-based \u2013 between what is referred to as the \u201cBedouins,\u201d represented by President Hadi and his allies, and those Tribesmen represented by the Southern Transitional Council (STC).", "Then the regional dimension comes in.", "It was clear that one of the main reasons behind the war in Yemen was related to a Saudi internal affair and when this domestic justification ceased to exist, MBS did not have the time to stop it. Then other things [came into the picture] like the economy of the war. There\u2019s also a wing in Saudi Arabia which to this day is still thinking about [annexing] Hadramawt and Mahra or getting extraterritorial rights in them. Saudi Arabia only put up a serious effort at winning the war until 2016 when the Kuwait peace negotiations started. When these negotiations failed, serious Saudi effort at winning the war was never resumed.", "What is the current status of peace negotiations?", "AA: The UN is now pursuing further negotiations, mostly in connection with the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement. But we have to accept the fact that the UN is a tool: the UN will not make peace, Yemenis will make peace. If the parties are serious about advancing towards peace, then the UN is a useful tool to work out areas of interest for negotiation. If one side is not interested in peace, then no matter how smart the special envoy is, the UN can do nothing. No one can force a peace agreement on anyone.", "I think we\u2019re now at a point where peace would actually be feasible to pursue. The obstacles that stood in the way of peace are falling one by one. The war economy was one of the key obstacles, but over the past few months, maybe a year, the income from it has been going down.", "I think the face-saving exit is not going to happen on the battlefield \u2013 Saudi Arabia has demonstrated incompetence over and over again. The only way is the political way \u2013 some kind of political production to give them a face-saving exit. Without that I think they will keep the conflict going \u2013 maybe even increase its intensity, leading to a lot more bloodshed. But there is no way that they can change the outcome \u2013 they have shown that they are unable to beat the Houthis militarily.", "Which party currently has the upper hand in the war?", "AA: I think the Houthis, and by association Iran, have won the war, and their victory is irreversible. Some will disagree but I say that because of the following: They are in full control of Yemeni state institutions. They have reconstituted a political elite deal that has governed Yemen for decades. They control the majority of the population. They are in a position to speak for the people of Yemen, while the internationally recognized government has been displaced and losing credibility over the years. They are now the voice of the northern Zaidi demographic and people turn to them to maintain their interests.", "So we have one side that controls the Yemeni state and another side that is unable to implement anything. The internationally recognized government has lost its base in the south and been unable to build institutions to compete with those controlled by the Houthis. It has lost credibility in the eyes of the population, who see the government as a willing participant in the weaponizing of the economy against the population. The government is blamed for not opening Sana\u2019a airport. It is blamed for obstacles placed on the import of petroleum products, food and basic commodities. It is blamed for having transferred the central bank to Aden and promising to pay salaries for all [public sector employees], then not paying salaries. So, the general population will give them no legitimacy. Now the government\u2019s legitimacy comes from the UN Security Council, then the UN Security Council can take it away at any time \u2013 and the government will have nothing left.", "So now that the Houthis have won, the continuation of war is not only unconscionable but also criminal. On Hadi\u2019s side, there are a lot of people who know that their careers will end with the end of the war.", "Unfortunately, the course of negotiation the special envoy is now pursuing is going to lead to a dead end. I think he, and really all of us, should start thinking of a new modality that is implementable. We need to recognize that the most we can get out of negotiations is to freeze and formalize the existing state of affairs so that every party controls and manages areas and population they are currently controlling. We need to formalize that control, foster coordination between these different groups so that the national institutions that have been divided into two or three pieces can be restored.", "Do the parties trust the UN?", "AA: The Houthis do not trust the UN.", "The internationally recognized government, on the other hand, has only the UN to give it legitimacy \u2013 so of course, they trust the UN. They know the UN is doing its best to help them return to Sana\u2019a. Saudi Arabia can exercise undue influence on what the UN does for a variety of reasons. It has excellent relations with permanent members of the UNSC. It also has various points of leverage: if it wants to harass the UN, it can withhold licenses for UN flights to Sana\u2019a, for example. It can refuse to finance the special mission and other UN activities. There are many ways Saudi Arabia can make life for the UN difficult. These tools are not available to the other side. So the UN is not neutral in this conflict \u2013 it cannot be for very pragmatic reasons.", "You referred there to UN Security Council Resolution 2216 \u2013 adopted in 2015 \u2013 which essentially enshrines the legitimacy of the Hadi government. Does the resolution still have a role to play?", "AA: Resolution 2216 was issued after the Houthis took control of Sana\u2019a. Its purpose was to deter them, force them to back down following the coup and make them return to the political process. It did not achieve this desired purpose and after a few months it lost its utility, so there is a need for a new, more balanced and more realistic resolution to deal with the Houthis.", "Since then and until this day, Resolution 2216 was negatively used. The Saudis used it to prolong the war. When the international community pressured Saudi Arabia to stop the war, it would say \u201cwe are ready [to do so], but the Houthis must implement Resolution 2216,\u201d i.e. withdraw from Sana\u2019a, hand over weapons and return to Sa\u2019ada, then agreements can then be reached.", "These impossible conditions were [applied] and used to prolong the war for years. Despite that, the main beneficiary from Resolution 2216 was the most competent party: the Houthis. Resolution 2216\u2019s validity ended four years ago, and the international community is still thinking of issuing a new resolution. Look, it\u2019s true that the [UN special] envoy has a role but, in the end, the Americans and British decide everything. They make the decisions with their eye on Saudi Arabia. They decide on [the] condition [that] they do not upset Saudi Arabia. And in the end, Saudi desire is what directs international decisions pertaining to Yemen. Meaning, no one is willing to make a decision that may cause Boeing to lose a $20 billion deal to Airbus.", "Tell us more about Islah. What is it?", "AA: Look, Islah is a tribe before it\u2019s anything else \u2013 it was a Zaidi tribe. Notice how all of Islah\u2019s main leaders have Zaidi origins and a Zaidi identity \u2013 the identity which I call the northern Zaidi tribal identity. Zaidiyyah as a [social] identity and not a [religious] sect. The aim of the uprising in 2011 was to end the northern Zaidi tribal monopoly of power. They [Islah] came and hijacked this revolution, and they were practically trying to turn the matter into [a question of] who will replace Ali Abdullah Saleh. [For Islah] this was to be Hamid al-Ahmar [a senior Islah MP, powerful businessman and sheikh from the highly influential Hashid tribal federation], recycling the northern tribal elite instead of including the rest of the society.", "This is why they lost their popular base, and the people, whether the Zaidi street or the rest of Yemen, viewed them as [hijackers] who are removing Ali Abdullah Saleh\u2019s regime and replacing it with the ugly side of Ali Abdullah Saleh\u2019s regime.", "Is there a sense of identity-driven hatred in Yemen?", "AA: Divisions are identity-based and politically expressed, but this is not hatred. The divisions are based on interests rather than animosity.", "What about the relationship between Iran and the Houthis? How do we square this with the Saudi-Houthi talks?", "AA: Iran sends the Houthis regular shipments of petroleum products \u2013 the estimated value of that is maybe $200-250 million a year. But this is only a small contribution to the Houthis\u2019 total revenue. Iran also gives the Houthis political advice, military training, and there are at least 5,000 students studying in Iran at any one time. We know they occasionally send missile parts or missiles \u2013 but the type of weaponry they use is actually available on the black market.

One is the war economy. People from all sides are making lots of money out of this conflict, including some front-line officials of the Arab Coalition. They have no interest in bringing this conflict to an end.", "The second reason is because the Saudis and the Houthis\u2014Ansar Allah\u2014have not been able to come to an agreement on the kind of long-term relationship they should have.", "Clearly, none of the stated goals of the international armed coalition at the beginning of the conflict have been achieved. On the one hand, Ansar Allah has been able to withstand all the pressure and take over the state institutions. On the other hand, the internationally-recognized government has been able to make itself irrelevant both by its incompetence, corruption, and by its inability to respond to the needs of its people.", "In this context it is hard for me to see the benefit or purpose of renewed sanctions, which usually affect the population more than they do those who control the population. In my view, it is useless. It serves no apparent interest if that interest is to bring this war to an end.", "For the Saudis, clearly they are fully involved. They are actually fighting and I think that, while they were interested in ending the conflict early on, since the failure of the Kuwait negotiations and peace talks in 2016, they have kept the war at a low level and made no effort to bring it to an end. In the meantime, they have used it to mobilize and agitate against Iran. Of course, Ansar Allah were the main beneficiary of this strategy.", "As far as Iran is concerned, I think their role in Yemen is very limited. It was very limited in the beginning, and it remains limited now. But as the conflict continues, Ansar Allah is being pushed against their will to the side of the Iranians because of their need for new defense technology.", "Ansar Allah has made an effort to stay away from Iran because they realize that their long-term interest is in having good relations with Saudi Arabia. They come from a part of Yemen which has always been connected to the Saudi economy. All their produce was sold in Saudi Arabia, all the imports that came to them came from Saudi Arabia. The currency of trade in their areas is the Saudi riyal not the Yemeni riyal. Their social relations are more connected to the Saudi side than they are to the Yemeni side.", "A normal situation for Ansar Allah and Saudi Arabia is good neighborly relations. This situation of antagonism is an aberration. I think they both realize that they need to work out a cooperative relationship. As long they don\u2019t, Iran benefits. Iran did not actively seek to establish a foothold in Yemen. It was the mismanagement of the Saada conflict from 2004 onwards that gave Iran that foothold with minimum investment on their part.", "The Stockholm Agreement is an entry point to a larger national ceasefire and return to peace. It would be useful for all the articles of the Stockholm Agreement to be implemented, but it is not necessary.", "I think both the Saudis and the Ansar Allah know exactly how this needs to be done. They are talking, and when they started talking they told the United Nations they do not need any help.", "One obstacle that stands in the way is that the Saudis are still clinging to the objective of bringing [President Abdrabbuh Mansur] Hadi back to Sana\u2019a. It is clear that this is not going to happen and the Saudis are hesitant to appear as if they have failed to achieve their objectives. They need a face-saving exit, one where they agree with the Ansar Allah in a way that makes them look better.", "Another factor is that Ansar Allah is factionalized.

So this is a somewhat different project for transparency than normal, because we usually were focused very, very narrowly on corruption as focused on illegality.", "So we looked at corruption. But we also looked at other defense pathways that can pull U.S. foreign policy as it relates to arms exports away from what one could argue is in the best interests of U.S. foreign policy and international peace overall.", "One of them, of course, is lobbying.

There\u2019s a lot of very strong empirical evidence that supports the fact that staffers are primarily hired for their access and less for the information expertise that they provide.", "That\u2019s just as true in the defense industry, but often neglected, as is the role that senior military officers and senior Department of Defense and State Department officials can play in the revolving door and how loose those rules are.", "Just as an example, General [James] Mattis was on the board of General Dynamics. He left the board and became the secretary of defense and is now already back on the board.", "This whole senior officers running senior defense firm stuff, this is a relatively recent situation. And it can have tremendous impacts both on the defense establishment and, frankly, the morale of the younger troops underneath them if those troops are concerned that those officers are looking out more for their future careers and less about getting them the best equipment and services that they need to do their missions.", "Then we also note the lack of controls for former military officers and others to go work for foreign countries. That\u2019s less common but it does happen.", "Bowman: You note in the report that \u201cfew recent cases exemplify this cycle as clearly as the war in Yemen,\u201d which is causing what the U.N. deems the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. How specifically has the US defense export sector sought to influence the government to maintain its support for the Saudi coalition fighting there, even in the face of mounting opposition within Congress and growing pressure from the international community to end the war?", "Vittori: Certainly. It basically runs the gamut across all of the pathways of influence. We noted, obviously, significant lobbying of both Republicans and Democrats to maintain those defense exports going forward. And campaign finance goes with it.", "And then there\u2019s the revolving door jobs. I\u2019ll just pick on Secretary Mattis again. When he was secretary, he was writing to Senators and Congressmen, saying don\u2019t restrict our ability to export these weapons. I have no indications of what he\u2019s done since he\u2019s gone back on General Dynamic\u2019s board. But I\u2019m sure they\u2019re quite pleased that somebody supported continued UAE exports on their board.", "Then there\u2019s soft influence. We document a number of cases, for example, with defense advisory boards and even think tanks. There was a a leak of the UAE ambassador\u2019s emails that documented a lot of things, including some questionable offsets given by U.S. companies that filter back in the U.S. to influence drone exports, for example. And also just significant money given to think tanks that helped support, for example, drone exports as well. Those think tanks argue that they were not engaged in lobbying. But they did things like set up roundtables with defense experts that could potentially help influence U.S. foreign policy on those issues.", "So it\u2019s not just one thing, and that\u2019s what the empirical evidence shows as well. It\u2019s not just lobbying or just revolving door. When all of these work together in concert they are far more effective.", "But defense industry lobbyists often go to members of Congress and talk about how many jobs are in their districts. I was able to interview a defense analyst who wishes to remain anonymous and he made it very clear that when they are lobbying Congress, their goal is to focus just on jobs and not focus on the larger foreign policy concerns. They keep the conversation very, very narrow, because often there are very, very large foreign policy concerns with defense exports \u2013 future blowback, diversion of goods, and so forth.", "In terms of Yemen and the exports to the UAE and Yemen, there are a lot of reasons countries decide to import weapons from a country like the U.S. One is national security. But believe it or not, that is often not the main reason. A primary reason might be to remain under the security blanket of a key ally. So a lot of the reason that Saudi Arabia and the UAE purchased weapons over the years is that they\u2019re very weak countries. And this helps keep them under the U.S. security umbrella.", "And it also allows for regime survival.", "One of the reasons that the United States was always happy to sell, frankly, was they never thought Saudi Arabia was really going to use most of the stuff. It was fairly safe. They were going to buy lots of stuff and make lots of American jobs. It was an easy export. Make lots of money. Keep the security umbrella going. Everybody was happy.

These pathways enable American defense firms to export arms and defense services to MENA countries despite many regimes\u2019 poor human rights and governance records, lack of transparency and accountability, and questionable outcomes for US foreign policy. This not only often leads to poor outcomes for American national security and foreign policy, but it is also harms international peace by helping to fuel conflict and human rights abuses in the MENA region.", "This report specifically examines how the US defense industry uses a combination of pathways to influence the American federal government to ensure the ability to export to countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), despite growing concerns both of their repressive regimes and their increasingly aggressive foreign policies, specifically their involvement in the civil war in Yemen. To illustrate these pathways of influence, this report provides examples such as key lobbying firms associated with a former member of the House Armed Services Committee and lobbyists with the Trump presidential campaign. It will assess how some recently retired senior military officers now work for the defense industry in MENA-related lobbying jobs, and even one case where a former Army officer joined the Emirati military, leading their helicopter forces there. This report will include examples such as the UAE\u2019s role in using an American private security company as a possible intermediary to push for policy change vis-\u00e0-vis US foreign policy with Qatar and Saudi Arabia\u2019s aggressive lobbying to limit censure for conduct in the conflict in Yemen.", "Beyond the sheer size of the sector, American defense export companies exhibit unique characteristics that make this economic sector especially important for scrutiny. First, the sector provides vital equipment and services to the United States and those of MENA regimes essential to their national security; without these goods and services, the United States would lack the military pillar of American foreign policy. American defense goods exported to MENA regimes are often key aspects of their own internal security as well as placing them firmly under the American defense umbrella against their external enemies. The fact that key defense components such as fighter aircraft and naval ships are often produced by one or a few firms, along with the significant control exercised by the United States federal government as the primary customer for most defense goods and its role in approving nearly all defense exports means that the defense sector and US government are intertwined in ways not exhibited in other export sectors.", "The MENA region is an especially important export customer for American defense firms. MENA is considered one of the most militarized regions in the world, with six out of the ten top ten defense budgets as a percentage of GDP found there.", "This report documents how these unique characteristics of the US defense export sector are intertwined with key pathways for influence vis-\u00e0-vis the US federal government in order for the defense export sector to ensure a relatively open legislative and regulatory environment to continue to export to the Middle East. Rarely is only one pathway used for influence by the defense sector; they are often intermingled to magnify influence towards desired policy outcomes. The pathways analyzed here are:", "Lobbying. Lobbying is any oral or written communication to influence executive and legislative branch officials on behalf of a client to formulate, modify, or adopt certain legislation, regulations, or policies of the US government. The defense sector runs extensive in-house lobbying activities as well as hiring outside lobbying firms, public relations firms, and consultants in order to help influence the US federal government towards defense export-friendly policies.", "Campaign Finance. Running for and staying in office is exceptionally expensive, and the defense industry is able to make significant campaign contributions, especially for elected officials on important Congressional committees or representing key defense firms in their districts. The role of so-called \u201cdark money,\u201d where money is donated theoretically separate from individual political campaigns by anonymous donors, including those in the defense sector, are especially pernicious. As a result, the US defense export sector is able to use its campaign contributions to not only ensure a relatively benign export environment, but perhaps more importantly, to prevent significant reforms unfavorable to the industry, for while there may be only one way to pass a Congressional bill, there are many ways to kill an unfavorable one.", "Revolving Door. This refers to high-level government employees, including members of Congress and their staffs, senior military personnel, and other members of the executive branch rotating to senior jobs in industry or lobbying-associated activities. It can also refer to industry leaders rotating into senior governmental jobs, usually on a relatively short-term basis of a few years, where they have the potential to make decisions that can affect their companies\u2019 interests. Empirical studies demonstrate that it is often access to government officials and insider knowledge rather than expertise in a particular policy arena that leads to these hiring decisions.", "This is especially common in national security-related work: the Project on Government Oversight found that in 2018 alone, there were at least 645 instances where the top 20 defense contractors hired former government officials, military officers, members of Congress, and senior legislative staff to be lobbyists, board members, or senior executives.", "Defense Offsets. These are provisions in foreign government defense procurement contracts that promise specific benefits to the contracting country as a condition for purchasing defense goods and services from a non-domestic supplier such as an American defense firm; in short, they are side deals and sweeteners for countries who purchase American defense goods. US defense contractors typically enter into an average of 30 to 60 offset agreements representing $3 to $7 billion in obligations each year. These contracts are a notorious conduit for corruption. Saudi Arabia and the UAE require defense offset contracts as part of defense deals, while keeping both the deals themselves and the beneficial owners of the firms associated with them secret. Thus, defense offset deals in these countries exhibit significant red flags for potentially corrupt activity. One such offset deal funneled cash from American arms contracts to the UAE government who then funneled it through a local think tank to an American one to conduct research and advocacy activities that supported loosening drone exports to the UAE.", "\u201cSoft\u201d Influence. These include defense industry funding of think tanks, media campaigns, and academic work that supports industry policies and goals. These methods of influence are not necessarily bad, but they can reinforce other pathways of influence in ways that benefit the defense industry but can hurt American foreign policy or national security interests. Soft influence includes the influence companies can gain from sitting on various policies boards, such as the Defense Policy Board, which provides advice on long term and enduring issues of defense planning as well as research and analysis on topics assigned by the Defense Secretary or his senior staff. That the board members provide advice on policies that have a direct financial bearing on their companies can be a conflict of interest. In some cases, former senior military leaders, once they left the service, have joined senior positions of defense companies and then also sat on the Defense Policy Board while at the same time enjoying fellowships with leading think tanks, demonstrating the overlapping aspects of the revolving door and soft influence.", "Corruption.", "https://ti-defence.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/US_Defense_Industry_Influence_Paper_v4_digital_singlePage.pdf", "(** A K)", "US-Marines im Jemen", "Die USA schickt Soldaten in den Jemen: Auf der jemenitischen, von den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten besetzten Insel Sokotra trafen in diesen Tagen weitere US-Milit\u00e4rs ein, Patriot-Raketensysteme sind schon errichtet.", "Die jemenitische Nachrichten-Website sanapostnews.com meldet:", "\u201eEine neue Gruppe aus dem Marinekorps der Vereinigten Staaten traf am Samstag auf der Insel Sokotra ein, nachdem die Patriot-Systeme installiert worden waren, wie lokale Quellen berichten.\u201c", "http://blauerbote.com/2020/03/10/us-marines-im-jemen/", "(** A K)", "US marines arrive on Yemen\u2019s Socotra to support UAE forces", "A new batch of US Marines arrived on the Yemeni island of Socotra on Saturday, according to local sources, installing Patriot defence systems.", "Sanaa Post reported that the American soldiers were received by the \u201coccupying\u201d UAE forces at their headquarters on the island.", "There is speculation that the US intends to establish its own military base amid reports that America had sent military experts to equip observation points to deploy radars and air defence points on the strategically located island overlooking the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.", "US forces had previously arrived on Socotra in December of last year and reportedly started installing a Patriot missile system in order to protect the Saudi and Emirati forces on the island at the time.", "According to the sources, on 21 December of last year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman ordered the UN-recognised, exiled Yemeni government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi to lease the entire island to the UAE for a period of about 95 years.

Limits have had to be set, posing a host of ethical dilemmas for MSF\u2019s operational decision-making.", "These dilemmas have revolved around how MSF can treat more patients while maintaining a high standard of medical care. This has involved a series of measures and decisions, including restricting admissions, referring patients to other hospitals, moving patients more quickly through the hospital and deciding not to expand the project\u2019s activities. While the physical dimensions of the hospital building are the main limiting factor in being able to treat more patients, these decisions have further restricted MSF\u2019s response. These decisions are rigorously debated, sometimes disagreed with, but in the end implemented by hundreds of staff in the hospital, with life and death consequences for thousands of women and children and their families", "One of the key measures to manage excessive demand has been to restrict access to maternity and child services. When the hospital opened, the admission criteria were restricted to pregnant women and children under 10, but as demand for services has grown the criteria have narrowed to exclude children over five. Growing demand was the key driver behind the change, but what is not clear is how much of the increased demand has been a result of growing needs, or improved acceptance and awareness of MSF.", "In the hospital\u2019s 36-bed neo-natal ward, which is reserved for serious cases, admission criteria are restricted to those born in the hospital.", "Even with restricted admission criteria, there are still thousands of patients MSF does not have the capacity to treat.

In many ways, this was a logical development in that it would hopefully reduce the number of women arriving with life-threatening complications. However, there were several arguments against the idea.", "Advocacy", "In deciding not to support primary healthcare centres, advocacy took on added importance. Advocacy was aimed at pushing health actors, including UN agencies and NGOs, to increase the provision of primary healthcare and sexual and reproductive health services. The hope was that this would help reduce the maternal, neo-natal and child mortality MSF was seeing by providing more options to address complications with pregnancies at an earlier stage.", "Conclusion", "MSF staff in Taiz have gone to great lengths to address healthcare needs, but within the constraints of the current project set-up they are reaching their limits.

Most data is collected either by, or in close collaboration with, authorities (either the internationally recognised government in Aden or the de facto Houthi authorities in Sana\u2019a). Data on food security, nutrition and mortality cannot be taken out of the country, and there are extreme limits on the extent to which data is shared even within the country. Independent, routine checks are limited or not allowed on certain types of data. In the absence of data sharing, there are questions about its quality and independence. In many cases, data is missing or very limited. SMART surveys are undertaken only very occasionally and are often out of the timeline of IPC analyses. Data is often not available or is as much as a year old by the time analysis is conducted. Data on sectors other than food security and nutrition is limited.", "Analysis challenges and constraints", "The central conundrum of the analysis in Yemen is that indicators of food insecurity have looked very severe for a long time but malnutrition figures have stayed fairly low, and official mortality figures are very low \u2013 even zero in some cases. The main question concerns what could explain nutritional resilience in the face of such a serious, widespread and long-lasting food security crisis.

Aside from the fact that the nutrition data was out of date for the 2018 analysis, no comprehensive explanation emerged.", "Influences on food security analysis in Yemen", "Independence of data collection and analysis", "Although many respondents noted that data collection processes had improved in recent years, a number of constraints on the independence of the analysis remain.

Incidents were reported where \u2018minders\u2019 accompanied field teams and told people how to answer questions. Combined with concerns about the lack of data transparency and sharing, this has led to a situation where many respondents suspect the independence of the data.", "In terms of the analysis, disagreements have been reported on how final numbers of people in need are determined, but no clear, overall pattern emerges from the interview evidence for this study.", "Access constraints", "The second major way in which the results of the analysis are potentially distorted concerns populations that are accessible and those that are not. An estimated 1.4 million people are living in inaccessible areas, and the extent to which available data accurately reflects their conditions is not known", "Influences. The data collection and analysis process may be influenced in several ways. One of these is access and, when access is blocked, how agency leadership can take up concerns with the authorities. Some respondents mentioned intimidation as a real deterrent to this kind of support. At the same time, there is persistent pressure, at least at a high level, for positive publicity from donors which are also direct belligerents in the war that is driving the humanitarian crisis. Some agency directors, and at times the Humanitarian Coordinator, engage with the Yemeni authorities to ensure access. This process needs to be regularised, and pressure needs to be maintained until better access is achieved. This requires strong and sustained advocacy with the authorities.
