The STC, the southern separatist group that has to date been funded and supported by the UAE, is to be absorbed into the Yemeni government, which itself will become answerable to a Saudi committee overseeing the implementation of the agreement.", "Political Aspects of the Agreement", "On the political front, the most important aspect of the Riyadh Agreement is the plan to form a new government including representatives from the STC, which from its inception in May 2017 until now had refused to recognize the Yemeni government\u2019s sovereignty and regularly challenged it for control of southern governorates.", "The agreement seems aimed to improve government decision-making and make it more inclusive. It attempts this by mandating that posts at the cabinet table be filled by properly qualified technocrats well known for their integrity. While these ministers will be politically affiliated \u2013 with cabinet seats also evenly split between northerners and southerners \u2013 the candidates must have previously refrained from engaging in \u201cinflammatory propaganda\u201d. Importantly, these ministers must be agreed to by consultations among the various anti-Houthi political forces", "At the governorate level, as well as calling for a new governor of Aden, the agreement also specifies that new governors will be named for Al-Dhalea and Abyan governorates within 30 days of the agreement being signed. The singling out of these two southern governorates is notable; as historic rivals, they are also currently bastions of support for the main parties to the agreement, Al-Dhalea for the STC and, to a lesser extent, Abyan for the Hadi government", "In regard to public finances, the agreement stipulates that all state revenues (including oil exports, customs, etc.) shall be deposited in the central bank in Aden \u2013 an attempt to end the recent practice of several governorates collecting and keeping these revenues for local spending purposes. The Riyadh Agreement states that transparency will be ensured through having all public spending subject to parliamentary oversight", "The Riyadh Agreement\u2019s mandates for government reforms, reasserting government control over revenues and resources, and the activation of supervisory agencies, would portend a house-cleaning of corruption and ineptitude that have stifled the government. However, the agreement does not include any clauses related to the high-level bureaucracy", "In specific regard to the STC, the Riyadh Agreement represents the first official recognition of the group as a political entity by Saudi Arabia.", "Military and Security Aspects of the Agreement", "The Riyadh Agreement calls for a widespread overhaul of the structure and composition of military and security forces across southern Yemen, with the apparent aim to unify command and control. Officially, most of the recomposed units will be under the Yemeni government ministries of defense and interior, but ultimately all units \u2013 save a presidential guard unit tasked with protecting both the president and STC leaders \u2013 will take directions from Riyadh. This reconfiguration is, according to the agreement, slated to be staggered over a 90-day period \u2013 an extremely ambitious timeline in an environment as fragmented as southern Yemen.", "The immediate focus of the agreement is to reset the clock on territorial advances made during clashes between STC- and Yemeni government-affiliated forces that began in August this year.", "The Riyadh agreement then focuses on securing Aden. All heavy weapons in the city held by any party \u2013 including tanks, armored vehicles, missile launchers and the like \u2013 are to be moved to bases under Saudi control within 15 days and cannot be redeployed except under Saudi approval and guidance.", "The military and security component of the Riyadh Agreement seems clearly intended to project a new reality of Saudi security control in southern Yemen. While the text of the agreement repeatedly makes reference to the \u201ccoalition\u201d which began the regional military intervention in Yemen, given the UAE\u2019s continuing withdrawal of forces the only significant power left in the consortium is Saudi Arabia. The Riyadh Agreement thus enshrines a new military dynamic; one where Riyadh assumes full oversight of all anti-Houthi forces in southern Yemen, most importantly supervising the movement of, and weapons supplied to, STC-aligned forces that had previously been beholden to Abu Dhabi.", "Looking Ahead", "While the Riyadh Agreement should position Saudi Arabia as the uncontested authority in southern Yemen, many factors still stand against the agreement\u2019s success.", "The agreement must also deal with the unwritten technicalities of how it should be implemented \u2013 By Maged al-Madhaji", "https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/8324", "(** B P)", "Preparing for a Failed War", "The recent Riyadh agreement was an effort by the Saudis and Emiratis to define future zones of influence in Yemen.", "However, the accord is really little more than a power-sharing agreement between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, through their respective proxies. At the same time, its vagueness means it carries the seeds of more divisions among Yemeni parties and could be a prelude to new conflicts.", "The deal is not only the outcome of a month-long negotiation process between Yemeni parties, but also part of broader understanding between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. It is a result of efforts led by Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, who since last March became the Saudi official in charge of the Yemeni file.", "After more than four years of conflict, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are more than ever convinced that the costly Yemen war should end. This is especially true after increasing international criticism that the Arab coalition has caused major civilian casualties and following attacks by Ansar Allah, better known as the Houthis, against Saudi targets. This pushed the Arab coalition partners to search for a new approach to organize matters among the factions aligned with them, and in that way create separate zones of influence for both countries.", "According to the Riyadh agreement, the UAE-backed STC is to be a part of the legitimate government, while its armed forces will be integrated into the forces of Yemen\u2019s Ministries of Defense and Interior. Through the STC\u2019s participation, the agreement will give the UAE a say in the new government in Aden. On the other side, the Saudis will oversee implementation of the agreement, both politically and on the ground. In this context, the UAE will withdraw its troops from Aden and hand over control to Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the Saudis will be responsible for interpreting the agreement\u2019s articles in case of a misunderstanding.", "The agreement contains annexes covering political, economic, military, and security arrangements. Accordingly, all steps in the deal center on dividing authority between the two parties. However, the representation of south and north Yemen used in the agreement is one of its problematic points. That is because most of the political forces in Yemen that claim to represent large geographical areas in fact only do so because they have the means to mobilize and enjoy support from regional powers. None were democratically elected to represent the people or areas that they claim to represent. This applies to the Houthis, the STC, and factions in Hadi\u2019s government, including the Islah Party. In effect, the agreement reduces the aspirations of Yemenis to parties that do not necessarily enjoy significant popular backing in their areas of control.", "Another mistake made in the agreement, one that is similar to all the agreements signed following the uprising against the late president \u2018Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011, is that it fails to adopt an inclusive approach. The Riyadh agreement ignores several factions, including southern factions that are not aligned with the STC.", "On the political front, the agreement deals with the current political elites, who are authorized to run affairs for unknown period of time. Yet these elites have lost legitimacy because many have extended their time in office beyond their prescribed mandates.", "The agreement also suffers from keeping Yemen under the trusteeship of regional powers, as it deprives the state of any sovereignty. Several articles emphasize Saudi supervision of the new government that will be formed as a consequence of the Riyadh agreement. In addition, it legitimizes the Saudi-UAE military presence in areas of Yemen, including the easternmost governorate of Mahra that is under Saudi control. This means that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will continue to have the latitude to intervene in internal Yemeni affairs.", "After five years of war in Yemen, the situation in the country is no longer a matter for Yemenis.

The STC, the southern separatist group that has to date been funded and supported by the UAE, is to be absorbed into the Yemeni government, which itself will become answerable to a Saudi committee overseeing the implementation of the agreement.", "Political Aspects of the Agreement", "On the political front, the most important aspect of the Riyadh Agreement is the plan to form a new government including representatives from the STC, which from its inception in May 2017 until now had refused to recognize the Yemeni government\u2019s sovereignty and regularly challenged it for control of southern governorates.", "The agreement seems aimed to improve government decision-making and make it more inclusive. It attempts this by mandating that posts at the cabinet table be filled by properly qualified technocrats well known for their integrity. While these ministers will be politically affiliated \u2013 with cabinet seats also evenly split between northerners and southerners \u2013 the candidates must have previously refrained from engaging in \u201cinflammatory propaganda\u201d. Importantly, these ministers must be agreed to by consultations among the various anti-Houthi political forces", "At the governorate level, as well as calling for a new governor of Aden, the agreement also specifies that new governors will be named for Al-Dhalea and Abyan governorates within 30 days of the agreement being signed. The singling out of these two southern governorates is notable; as historic rivals, they are also currently bastions of support for the main parties to the agreement, Al-Dhalea for the STC and, to a lesser extent, Abyan for the Hadi government", "In regard to public finances, the agreement stipulates that all state revenues (including oil exports, customs, etc.) shall be deposited in the central bank in Aden \u2013 an attempt to end the recent practice of several governorates collecting and keeping these revenues for local spending purposes. The Riyadh Agreement states that transparency will be ensured through having all public spending subject to parliamentary oversight", "The Riyadh Agreement\u2019s mandates for government reforms, reasserting government control over revenues and resources, and the activation of supervisory agencies, would portend a house-cleaning of corruption and ineptitude that have stifled the government. However, the agreement does not include any clauses related to the high-level bureaucracy", "In specific regard to the STC, the Riyadh Agreement represents the first official recognition of the group as a political entity by Saudi Arabia.", "Military and Security Aspects of the Agreement", "The Riyadh Agreement calls for a widespread overhaul of the structure and composition of military and security forces across southern Yemen, with the apparent aim to unify command and control. Officially, most of the recomposed units will be under the Yemeni government ministries of defense and interior, but ultimately all units \u2013 save a presidential guard unit tasked with protecting both the president and STC leaders \u2013 will take directions from Riyadh. This reconfiguration is, according to the agreement, slated to be staggered over a 90-day period \u2013 an extremely ambitious timeline in an environment as fragmented as southern Yemen.", "The immediate focus of the agreement is to reset the clock on territorial advances made during clashes between STC- and Yemeni government-affiliated forces that began in August this year.", "The Riyadh agreement then focuses on securing Aden. All heavy weapons in the city held by any party \u2013 including tanks, armored vehicles, missile launchers and the like \u2013 are to be moved to bases under Saudi control within 15 days and cannot be redeployed except under Saudi approval and guidance.", "The military and security component of the Riyadh Agreement seems clearly intended to project a new reality of Saudi security control in southern Yemen. While the text of the agreement repeatedly makes reference to the \u201ccoalition\u201d which began the regional military intervention in Yemen, given the UAE\u2019s continuing withdrawal of forces the only significant power left in the consortium is Saudi Arabia. The Riyadh Agreement thus enshrines a new military dynamic; one where Riyadh assumes full oversight of all anti-Houthi forces in southern Yemen, most importantly supervising the movement of, and weapons supplied to, STC-aligned forces that had previously been beholden to Abu Dhabi.", "Looking Ahead", "While the Riyadh Agreement should position Saudi Arabia as the uncontested authority in southern Yemen, many factors still stand against the agreement\u2019s success.", "The agreement must also deal with the unwritten technicalities of how it should be implemented \u2013 By Maged al-Madhaji", "https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/8324", "(** B P)", "Preparing for a Failed War", "The recent Riyadh agreement was an effort by the Saudis and Emiratis to define future zones of influence in Yemen.", "However, the accord is really little more than a power-sharing agreement between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, through their respective proxies. At the same time, its vagueness means it carries the seeds of more divisions among Yemeni parties and could be a prelude to new conflicts.", "The deal is not only the outcome of a month-long negotiation process between Yemeni parties, but also part of broader understanding between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. It is a result of efforts led by Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, who since last March became the Saudi official in charge of the Yemeni file.", "After more than four years of conflict, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are more than ever convinced that the costly Yemen war should end. This is especially true after increasing international criticism that the Arab coalition has caused major civilian casualties and following attacks by Ansar Allah, better known as the Houthis, against Saudi targets. This pushed the Arab coalition partners to search for a new approach to organize matters among the factions aligned with them, and in that way create separate zones of influence for both countries.", "According to the Riyadh agreement, the UAE-backed STC is to be a part of the legitimate government, while its armed forces will be integrated into the forces of Yemen\u2019s Ministries of Defense and Interior. Through the STC\u2019s participation, the agreement will give the UAE a say in the new government in Aden. On the other side, the Saudis will oversee implementation of the agreement, both politically and on the ground. In this context, the UAE will withdraw its troops from Aden and hand over control to Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the Saudis will be responsible for interpreting the agreement\u2019s articles in case of a misunderstanding.", "The agreement contains annexes covering political, economic, military, and security arrangements. Accordingly, all steps in the deal center on dividing authority between the two parties. However, the representation of south and north Yemen used in the agreement is one of its problematic points. That is because most of the political forces in Yemen that claim to represent large geographical areas in fact only do so because they have the means to mobilize and enjoy support from regional powers. None were democratically elected to represent the people or areas that they claim to represent. This applies to the Houthis, the STC, and factions in Hadi\u2019s government, including the Islah Party. In effect, the agreement reduces the aspirations of Yemenis to parties that do not necessarily enjoy significant popular backing in their areas of control.", "Another mistake made in the agreement, one that is similar to all the agreements signed following the uprising against the late president \u2018Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011, is that it fails to adopt an inclusive approach. The Riyadh agreement ignores several factions, including southern factions that are not aligned with the STC.", "On the political front, the agreement deals with the current political elites, who are authorized to run affairs for unknown period of time. Yet these elites have lost legitimacy because many have extended their time in office beyond their prescribed mandates.", "The agreement also suffers from keeping Yemen under the trusteeship of regional powers, as it deprives the state of any sovereignty. Several articles emphasize Saudi supervision of the new government that will be formed as a consequence of the Riyadh agreement. In addition, it legitimizes the Saudi-UAE military presence in areas of Yemen, including the easternmost governorate of Mahra that is under Saudi control. This means that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will continue to have the latitude to intervene in internal Yemeni affairs.", "After five years of war in Yemen, the situation in the country is no longer a matter for Yemenis.

Partner: At first you will always face challenges. So you have to prove over time that you are neutral, that you're impartial and that you apply those principles from the beginning, and don't change them \u2013 to demonstrate integrity from the start. But at the same time, respecting cultural factors and values to somehow create that acceptance by the communities where you work. But it can be quite a rollercoaster: some days you\u2019re accepted, the next you\u2019re viewed badly.  I think the advantage in us working with Tearfund is that we are able to engage in areas where maybe other humanitarian groups won\u2019t go because they are considered to be insignificant or not known. And I think this is the advantage. Tearfund is known. Andrew: How are the Yemeni people coping with this crisis? Partner: There is a huge sense of fatigue. The biggest challenge is anything from depression to burn out. I think in the beginning of the crisis people were looking for hope in their family and their social groups, which is very important in Yemen. But now families are breaking up and so social and family support is being destroyed.

Officially, most of the recomposed units will be under the Yemeni government ministries of defense and interior, but ultimately all units \u2013 save a presidential guard unit tasked with protecting both the president and STC leaders \u2013 will take directions from Riyadh. This reconfiguration is, according to the agreement, slated to be staggered over a 90-day period \u2013 an extremely ambitious timeline in an environment as fragmented as southern Yemen.", "The immediate focus of the agreement is to reset the clock on territorial advances made during clashes between STC- and Yemeni government-affiliated forces that began in August this year.", "The Riyadh agreement then focuses on securing Aden. All heavy weapons in the city held by any party \u2013 including tanks, armored vehicles, missile launchers and the like \u2013 are to be moved to bases under Saudi control within 15 days and cannot be redeployed except under Saudi approval and guidance.", "The military and security component of the Riyadh Agreement seems clearly intended to project a new reality of Saudi security control in southern Yemen. While the text of the agreement repeatedly makes reference to the \u201ccoalition\u201d which began the regional military intervention in Yemen, given the UAE\u2019s continuing withdrawal of forces the only significant power left in the consortium is Saudi Arabia.

At the same time, its vagueness means it carries the seeds of more divisions among Yemeni parties and could be a prelude to new conflicts.", "The deal is not only the outcome of a month-long negotiation process between Yemeni parties, but also part of broader understanding between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. It is a result of efforts led by Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, who since last March became the Saudi official in charge of the Yemeni file.", "After more than four years of conflict, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are more than ever convinced that the costly Yemen war should end. This is especially true after increasing international criticism that the Arab coalition has caused major civilian casualties and following attacks by Ansar Allah, better known as the Houthis, against Saudi targets. This pushed the Arab coalition partners to search for a new approach to organize matters among the factions aligned with them, and in that way create separate zones of influence for both countries.", "According to the Riyadh agreement, the UAE-backed STC is to be a part of the legitimate government, while its armed forces will be integrated into the forces of Yemen\u2019s Ministries of Defense and Interior. Through the STC\u2019s participation, the agreement will give the UAE a say in the new government in Aden. On the other side, the Saudis will oversee implementation of the agreement, both politically and on the ground. In this context, the UAE will withdraw its troops from Aden and hand over control to Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the Saudis will be responsible for interpreting the agreement\u2019s articles in case of a misunderstanding.", "The agreement contains annexes covering political, economic, military, and security arrangements. Accordingly, all steps in the deal center on dividing authority between the two parties. However, the representation of south and north Yemen used in the agreement is one of its problematic points. That is because most of the political forces in Yemen that claim to represent large geographical areas in fact only do so because they have the means to mobilize and enjoy support from regional powers. None were democratically elected to represent the people or areas that they claim to represent. This applies to the Houthis, the STC, and factions in Hadi\u2019s government, including the Islah Party. In effect, the agreement reduces the aspirations of Yemenis to parties that do not necessarily enjoy significant popular backing in their areas of control.", "Another mistake made in the agreement, one that is similar to all the agreements signed following the uprising against the late president \u2018Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011, is that it fails to adopt an inclusive approach. The Riyadh agreement ignores several factions, including southern factions that are not aligned with the STC.", "On the political front, the agreement deals with the current political elites, who are authorized to run affairs for unknown period of time. Yet these elites have lost legitimacy because many have extended their time in office beyond their prescribed mandates.", "The agreement also suffers from keeping Yemen under the trusteeship of regional powers, as it deprives the state of any sovereignty.

It attempts this by mandating that posts at the cabinet table be filled by properly qualified technocrats well known for their integrity. While these ministers will be politically affiliated \u2013 with cabinet seats also evenly split between northerners and southerners \u2013 the candidates must have previously refrained from engaging in \u201cinflammatory propaganda\u201d.

The singling out of these two southern governorates is notable; as historic rivals, they are also currently bastions of support for the main parties to the agreement, Al-Dhalea for the STC and, to a lesser extent, Abyan for the Hadi government", "In regard to public finances, the agreement stipulates that all state revenues (including oil exports, customs, etc.) shall be deposited in the central bank in Aden \u2013 an attempt to end the recent practice of several governorates collecting and keeping these revenues for local spending purposes.

Officially, most of the recomposed units will be under the Yemeni government ministries of defense and interior, but ultimately all units \u2013 save a presidential guard unit tasked with protecting both the president and STC leaders \u2013 will take directions from Riyadh. This reconfiguration is, according to the agreement, slated to be staggered over a 90-day period \u2013 an extremely ambitious timeline in an environment as fragmented as southern Yemen.", "The immediate focus of the agreement is to reset the clock on territorial advances made during clashes between STC- and Yemeni government-affiliated forces that began in August this year.", "The Riyadh agreement then focuses on securing Aden. All heavy weapons in the city held by any party \u2013 including tanks, armored vehicles, missile launchers and the like \u2013 are to be moved to bases under Saudi control within 15 days and cannot be redeployed except under Saudi approval and guidance.", "The military and security component of the Riyadh Agreement seems clearly intended to project a new reality of Saudi security control in southern Yemen. While the text of the agreement repeatedly makes reference to the \u201ccoalition\u201d which began the regional military intervention in Yemen, given the UAE\u2019s continuing withdrawal of forces the only significant power left in the consortium is Saudi Arabia. The Riyadh Agreement thus enshrines a new military dynamic; one where Riyadh assumes full oversight of all anti-Houthi forces in southern Yemen, most importantly supervising the movement of, and weapons supplied to, STC-aligned forces that had previously been beholden to Abu Dhabi.", "Looking Ahead", "While the Riyadh Agreement should position Saudi Arabia as the uncontested authority in southern Yemen, many factors still stand against the agreement\u2019s success.", "The agreement must also deal with the unwritten technicalities of how it should be implemented \u2013 By Maged al-Madhaji", "https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/8324", "(** B P)", "Preparing for a Failed War", "The recent Riyadh agreement was an effort by the Saudis and Emiratis to define future zones of influence in Yemen.", "However, the accord is really little more than a power-sharing agreement between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, through their respective proxies.

It is a result of efforts led by Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, who since last March became the Saudi official in charge of the Yemeni file.", "After more than four years of conflict, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are more than ever convinced that the costly Yemen war should end. This is especially true after increasing international criticism that the Arab coalition has caused major civilian casualties and following attacks by Ansar Allah, better known as the Houthis, against Saudi targets. This pushed the Arab coalition partners to search for a new approach to organize matters among the factions aligned with them, and in that way create separate zones of influence for both countries.", "According to the Riyadh agreement, the UAE-backed STC is to be a part of the legitimate government, while its armed forces will be integrated into the forces of Yemen\u2019s Ministries of Defense and Interior. Through the STC\u2019s participation, the agreement will give the UAE a say in the new government in Aden. On the other side, the Saudis will oversee implementation of the agreement, both politically and on the ground. In this context, the UAE will withdraw its troops from Aden and hand over control to Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the Saudis will be responsible for interpreting the agreement\u2019s articles in case of a misunderstanding.", "The agreement contains annexes covering political, economic, military, and security arrangements. Accordingly, all steps in the deal center on dividing authority between the two parties. However, the representation of south and north Yemen used in the agreement is one of its problematic points. That is because most of the political forces in Yemen that claim to represent large geographical areas in fact only do so because they have the means to mobilize and enjoy support from regional powers. None were democratically elected to represent the people or areas that they claim to represent. This applies to the Houthis, the STC, and factions in Hadi\u2019s government, including the Islah Party. In effect, the agreement reduces the aspirations of Yemenis to parties that do not necessarily enjoy significant popular backing in their areas of control.", "Another mistake made in the agreement, one that is similar to all the agreements signed following the uprising against the late president \u2018Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011, is that it fails to adopt an inclusive approach. The Riyadh agreement ignores several factions, including southern factions that are not aligned with the STC.", "On the political front, the agreement deals with the current political elites, who are authorized to run affairs for unknown period of time. Yet these elites have lost legitimacy because many have extended their time in office beyond their prescribed mandates.", "The agreement also suffers from keeping Yemen under the trusteeship of regional powers, as it deprives the state of any sovereignty. Several articles emphasize Saudi supervision of the new government that will be formed as a consequence of the Riyadh agreement. In addition, it legitimizes the Saudi-UAE military presence in areas of Yemen, including the easternmost governorate of Mahra that is under Saudi control. This means that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will continue to have the latitude to intervene in internal Yemeni affairs.", "After five years of war in Yemen, the situation in the country is no longer a matter for Yemenis.
