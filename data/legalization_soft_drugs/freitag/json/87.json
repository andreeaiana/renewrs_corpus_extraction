Although widely presented as a war between two distinct coalitions, the conflict is in fact multipolar, fuelled by regional and international support for the various parties involved in the fighting.", "There is broad consensus among international policy-makers that the only way the conflict can be brought to a sustainable end is through political mediation. Yet the current UN-led peace process has not been structured in a way that reflects the complexity of the dynamics in play, and some policy-makers currently lack the capacity to develop a deep understanding of the situation in order to consider a more inclusive structure for peacebuilding and diplomacy.", "Maintaining the illusion that either the internationally recognized president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his allies, or the alliance between the Zaydi Shia Houthi rebels and the supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, are representative of all the warring groups in Yemen would be a mistake. Tensions are rife within both coalitions, and particularly so in the deeply divided anti-Houthi bloc.", "Because of the wide variety of local dynamics and grievances, Yemen risks seeing the \u2018big war\u2019 ended only to be consumed by a series of complex \u2018small wars\u2019 that are open to exploitation by national and regional actors.", "On the assumption that a durable ceasefire can be brokered and a political process initiated, policy-makers working on the Yemen conflict need to begin planning for a peace process that is more inclusive than were the abortive attempts during the transitional period of 2012\u201314, which prioritized elite-level mediation and security concerns \u2013 particularly counterterrorism initiatives \u2013 over the economic needs of the population.", "The new political process will need to give equal weight to bottom-up, grassroots local approaches to peacebuilding alongside top-down, national and elite-level interests; and ensure that the political, security and economic tracks of the transition are interlinked rather than dealt with separately.", "Failure to expand representation and to focus on local governance will almost certainly lead to renewed hostilities at a local level that could push Yemen a step closer to becoming a \u2018chaos state\u2019 \u2013 a country defined by little more than its borders, in which complex regional conflicts are deepened and prolonged by the interests and actions of external players Contents:", "Summary 2 1) Introduction 3 2) Yemen\u2019s War in Brief Historical Context 7 3) The Seeds of Civil War: Yemen in Transition 13 4) The Road to War: the Houthi Takeover 21 5) An Unfolding Conflict 26 6) Another Time, Another Country: the Social and Security Impacts of the Civil War 35 7) Current Approaches and Prospects for Peace 37 8) Conclusions and Lessons Learned 40 Abbreviations and Acronyms 43 About the Author 44 Acknowledgments 44", "From the introduction", "There is a growing consensus among Yemen analysts and researchers that the transitional process of 2012\u201314 failed because of exactly such a gap in policy-makers\u2019 understanding of Yemen, and because of the mismatch between the needs of the Yemeni people and the priorities of the transition\u2019s foreign sponsors. Along with the Yemeni elites, the UN and the member states of the UN Security Council focused on political power-balancing at the elite level, reinforcing the power of these elites while ignoring local dynamics and historically marginalized groups such as the Houthis and southern separatists, and paying little more than lip service to addressing the collapse in services and standards of living.", "The window of opportunity for peace in Yemen is narrowing, and the cost of failure is rising. The Arab world\u2019s poorest country is on the verge of total collapse, and one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world has the potential to deepen even further as the country descends into even bloodier, ever more complex war.", "Conclusions", "Yemen\u2019s war has reached a stalemate in which outright military victory of any kind is highly unlikely, and would come at an intolerably high cost, particularly for people already on the brink of starvation. It is widely agreed \u2013 and has been stated even by Saudi and Iranian officials \u2013 that a political solution is the only way for the war to end. But what are the prospects for peace?", "The civil war is multifaceted, rather than a conflict between two distinct coalitions, and is being fought by a wide array of actors with deeply divergent interests and agendas. It is best described as a \u2018big war\u2019 made up of many \u2018small wars\u2019 that will all need to be ended if a sustainable peace is to be built in the future. To achieve this will require a different approach by the international community from that taken in the political transition of 2012\u201314. While that process ultimately collapsed because of the Houthi\u2013Saleh coup, various factors made the coup possible: not only the machinations of the northern rebels and the former president, but also the fact that the transition\u2019s sponsors accorded higher priority to elite-level negotiations than to the grievances and needs of local and identity groups, including their urgent economic needs.", "Local grievances and divisions have only deepened since the war began, not just between the highland alliance and these local and identity groups, but also between anti-Houthi fighters and the Hadi government, and between the different factions themselves. Should the physical conflict be brought to an end, failure to begin the reconciliation process early on and directly address local grievances as part of any settlement will be likely to result in the \u2018big war\u2019 ending only for the many \u2018small wars\u2019 to continue, which in turn could lead to a rapid resumption of national-level hostilities fuelled by regional support.", "Yet at present, while the Houthi\u2013Saleh alliance is represented at the UN-brokered talks, its counterpart is a delegation appointed by President Hadi that bears little resemblance to the forces fighting on the ground, or the civil society groups that have effectively been excised from the political process because of their unwillingness to take part in armed conflict. While the Hadi team may be able to negotiate a deal with the Houthis, it will need Saudi and Emirati leaders \u2013 increasingly divided over the role of Islah in the country\u2019s future and over the role of southern secessionists \u2013 to try to convince the combatants to bring the fighting to a halt, to observe the terms of the truce and to participate in the subsequent political process.", "It is still unclear what incentive there will be for these groups to stop fighting or to take part in another transition process, especially if it does not meet their expectations. \u2018We support Hadi because he represents the outcomes of the National Dialogue, and because the dialogue gives us regional autonomy and calls for development of the regions,\u2019 a Marebi tribal leader told the author in an interview in Riyadh in January 2016. If the autonomy and developmental assistance he and his fellow tribesmen require is not forthcoming after the conflict, he said, then \u2018we will go to war again until we get our rights\u2019.", "Many of the forces currently participating in the war are made up of unsteady and divided alliances: between local tribesmen, socialists, and Islahi and Salafist forces in Taiz, or the different southern and Islamist factions in Aden. The Mareb tribes are said to be nervous that Islah-backed forces will seek to control their territory in the event of a peace deal, and that revenge killings between aggrieved pro- and anti-Houthi tribes will lead to a war in the province. AQAP is also likely to attempt to exploit anger among Sunnis that a deal has been done with the Houthis.", "Given the rise in levels of poverty and pre-existing resource constraints, as well as animosities between different local factions, the probability of localized conflict is high. The government is very unlikely to be able to deal with these issues effectively. The Saleh regime structured the security forces to ensure that northerners provided the bulk of the army and police, such that the pull-out of Houthi\u2013 Saleh forces has led to security vacuums in Aden and elsewhere. The Hadi government, which proved to be administratively weak before the war and is currently internally divided, has unsurprisingly struggled to restore order \u2013 by Peter Salisbury", "https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/yemen-stemming-rise-chaos-state and in full (PDF): https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2016-05-25-yemen-stemming-rise-of-chaos-state-salisbury.pdf", "Comment by Judith Brown: An long and detailed article by Peter Salisbury who has a real feel for Yemeni politics.

But, apparently, none of this is worth repeating.", "To be clear, it is not that NPR and other media outlets never mention such inconvenient facts, they just do so rarely. So, for example, in the case of Yemen, I was able to find only six (6) occasions this year in which NPR had a segment talking about the link between the U.S. and the Saudi coalition assault on Yemen. This is compared to the coverage given to Syria, and in particular the human rights abuses of the Assad government, which is nearly a daily drum beat.", "The result of this disproportionate news coverage is that the listener could very well miss out entirely on any discussion of such issues as U.S.-backed crimes in Yemen. And, even if one does hear a segment or two on this matter, this issue will be easily forgotten and certainly not taken as seriously or treated as urgently as the misdeeds of the U.S.\u2019s ostensible enemies, such as Syria\u2019s Assad government, to which NPR gives nearly obsessive attention.", "In this way, we in the U.S., who may otherwise be moved to care about the fate of millions in Yemen whose lives are being upended with our own government\u2019s complicity, are lulled into complacency, with our comfortable feeling about our nation\u2019s inherent goodness fully intact.

But between such moments, subcommittees have been discussing key issues, including how to revive the political process and restore state authority. The peace process is far from dead, even if the climb remains steep. In fact, the on-again, off-again talks represent one of the best opportunities for a near-term resolution to one of the region\u2019s civil wars. Indeed, despite the ongoing tensions\u2014which are expected when warring parties sit down to talk\u2014small and symbolic shifts should not be dismissed in the face of the expected dramatic posturing.", "Still, the challenges ahead are not insignificant. Most troubling if not surprising is lack of agreement on the central issue of who will lead the new government. The Houthis understandably want a role and do not trust that a Hadi-led transition would be inclusive. Hadi and his Gulf backers want nothing less than the full implementation of UN SC resolution 2216, but that one-sided document calls for nothing less than the surrender of the Houthis and restoring Hadi as the head of Yemen\u2019s \u201clegitimate\u201d government.  With Hadi as the head of Yemen\u2019s \u201cinternationally recognized government,\u201d it bears reflection on the importance of the word \u201cinternationally\u201d in that phrase. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and other nations may accept him as Yemen\u2019s legitimate leader, but the reality is that few inside Yemen view him as such. To many, he is little more than a puppet supported by Saudi Arabia in pursuit of its own interests in Yemen. For others, he may have had a legitimate role following his election as interim president in 2012, but that two-year term expired in February 2014, well before the Houthi invasion of Sanaa in September of that year. As such, for many (particularly but not only in the north), he no longer has any legal basis to claim a position of authority in the Yemeni government. The United Nations and other regimes may see little alternative to Hadi for the moment, but it is crucial for a peaceful transition in Yemen to remember that many Yemenis do not share that view.  And while Yemen\u2019s \u201clegitimate\u201d government periodically declares that Aden has been liberated, the more meaningful reality is that Hadi and his government remain in exile and much of Aden and the south remain unsafe. As the \u201ctemporary\u201d capital, Aden is highly divided, with few jobs and violence routine. Another major challenge is to move toward a much more inclusive process bybringing in diverse parties, most notably from the south. Southerners do not embrace Hadi as their representative, and indeed they are no longer united, if they ever were.", "Bringing in southern voices directly into the peace talks would increase the possibility of reaching an ultimate arrangement that might accommodate some of their concerns.

On the other side, some countries of the Arab coalition have sent weapons to these two terror groups. All these have bolstered the strength of the terrorists in the war-torn Yemen. The terror groups also lunched effective operations in Hardhramaut and Aden provinces, assassinating some politicians and military commanders, and attacking army bases and pro-Mansour Hadi forces.", "Based on what was given, it can be noted that Saudi Arabia has shaken up its priority list in the region though in practice its war on Ansarulah and the Yemeni army is under way. But this Saudi adventure is highly risky because attacks on Al-Qaeda and ISIS which mean opening new fronts, while the kingdom has not concluded the war at the first fronts, could break Saudi Arabia\u2019s efforts and thus result in heavy losses.", "Generally, it must be said that Saudi Arabia has launched a full-scale war against Yemen and pounded the country point by point.

Along with the Yemeni elites, the UN and the member states of the UN Security Council focused on political power-balancing at the elite level, reinforcing the power of these elites while ignoring local dynamics and historically marginalized groups such as the Houthis and southern separatists, and paying little more than lip service to addressing the collapse in services and standards of living.", "The window of opportunity for peace in Yemen is narrowing, and the cost of failure is rising. The Arab world\u2019s poorest country is on the verge of total collapse, and one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world has the potential to deepen even further as the country descends into even bloodier, ever more complex war.", "Conclusions", "Yemen\u2019s war has reached a stalemate in which outright military victory of any kind is highly unlikely, and would come at an intolerably high cost, particularly for people already on the brink of starvation. It is widely agreed \u2013 and has been stated even by Saudi and Iranian officials \u2013 that a political solution is the only way for the war to end. But what are the prospects for peace?", "The civil war is multifaceted, rather than a conflict between two distinct coalitions, and is being fought by a wide array of actors with deeply divergent interests and agendas. It is best described as a \u2018big war\u2019 made up of many \u2018small wars\u2019 that will all need to be ended if a sustainable peace is to be built in the future. To achieve this will require a different approach by the international community from that taken in the political transition of 2012\u201314. While that process ultimately collapsed because of the Houthi\u2013Saleh coup, various factors made the coup possible: not only the machinations of the northern rebels and the former president, but also the fact that the transition\u2019s sponsors accorded higher priority to elite-level negotiations than to the grievances and needs of local and identity groups, including their urgent economic needs.", "Local grievances and divisions have only deepened since the war began, not just between the highland alliance and these local and identity groups, but also between anti-Houthi fighters and the Hadi government, and between the different factions themselves. Should the physical conflict be brought to an end, failure to begin the reconciliation process early on and directly address local grievances as part of any settlement will be likely to result in the \u2018big war\u2019 ending only for the many \u2018small wars\u2019 to continue, which in turn could lead to a rapid resumption of national-level hostilities fuelled by regional support.", "Yet at present, while the Houthi\u2013Saleh alliance is represented at the UN-brokered talks, its counterpart is a delegation appointed by President Hadi that bears little resemblance to the forces fighting on the ground, or the civil society groups that have effectively been excised from the political process because of their unwillingness to take part in armed conflict. While the Hadi team may be able to negotiate a deal with the Houthis, it will need Saudi and Emirati leaders \u2013 increasingly divided over the role of Islah in the country\u2019s future and over the role of southern secessionists \u2013 to try to convince the combatants to bring the fighting to a halt, to observe the terms of the truce and to participate in the subsequent political process.", "It is still unclear what incentive there will be for these groups to stop fighting or to take part in another transition process, especially if it does not meet their expectations. \u2018We support Hadi because he represents the outcomes of the National Dialogue, and because the dialogue gives us regional autonomy and calls for development of the regions,\u2019 a Marebi tribal leader told the author in an interview in Riyadh in January 2016. If the autonomy and developmental assistance he and his fellow tribesmen require is not forthcoming after the conflict, he said, then \u2018we will go to war again until we get our rights\u2019.", "Many of the forces currently participating in the war are made up of unsteady and divided alliances: between local tribesmen, socialists, and Islahi and Salafist forces in Taiz, or the different southern and Islamist factions in Aden. The Mareb tribes are said to be nervous that Islah-backed forces will seek to control their territory in the event of a peace deal, and that revenge killings between aggrieved pro- and anti-Houthi tribes will lead to a war in the province. AQAP is also likely to attempt to exploit anger among Sunnis that a deal has been done with the Houthis.", "Given the rise in levels of poverty and pre-existing resource constraints, as well as animosities between different local factions, the probability of localized conflict is high. The government is very unlikely to be able to deal with these issues effectively. The Saleh regime structured the security forces to ensure that northerners provided the bulk of the army and police, such that the pull-out of Houthi\u2013 Saleh forces has led to security vacuums in Aden and elsewhere.

And, even if one does hear a segment or two on this matter, this issue will be easily forgotten and certainly not taken as seriously or treated as urgently as the misdeeds of the U.S.\u2019s ostensible enemies, such as Syria\u2019s Assad government, to which NPR gives nearly obsessive attention.", "In this way, we in the U.S., who may otherwise be moved to care about the fate of millions in Yemen whose lives are being upended with our own government\u2019s complicity, are lulled into complacency, with our comfortable feeling about our nation\u2019s inherent goodness fully intact. The result is that those in power in our ostensibly democratic government are given a free hand to aid and abet such atrocities as the near-total destruction of Yemen without the fear of any reprisal or approbation \u2013 by Dan Kovalik", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-kovalik/npr-yemen--the-downplayin_b_10132892.html", "Comment: That\u2019s not only NPR, that are not only US media.

He described the truce on the ground as holding at around 80 to 90 percent, even as the delegations of the Houthi-GPC alliance and the government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi express frustrations at the other and even periodically walk away from the table.", "Back and forth and repeated blaming is disheartening, but not unexpected. But between such moments, subcommittees have been discussing key issues, including how to revive the political process and restore state authority. The peace process is far from dead, even if the climb remains steep. In fact, the on-again, off-again talks represent one of the best opportunities for a near-term resolution to one of the region\u2019s civil wars. Indeed, despite the ongoing tensions\u2014which are expected when warring parties sit down to talk\u2014small and symbolic shifts should not be dismissed in the face of the expected dramatic posturing.", "Still, the challenges ahead are not insignificant. Most troubling if not surprising is lack of agreement on the central issue of who will lead the new government. The Houthis understandably want a role and do not trust that a Hadi-led transition would be inclusive. Hadi and his Gulf backers want nothing less than the full implementation of UN SC resolution 2216, but that one-sided document calls for nothing less than the surrender of the Houthis and restoring Hadi as the head of Yemen\u2019s \u201clegitimate\u201d government.  With Hadi as the head of Yemen\u2019s \u201cinternationally recognized government,\u201d it bears reflection on the importance of the word \u201cinternationally\u201d in that phrase. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and other nations may accept him as Yemen\u2019s legitimate leader, but the reality is that few inside Yemen view him as such. To many, he is little more than a puppet supported by Saudi Arabia in pursuit of its own interests in Yemen. For others, he may have had a legitimate role following his election as interim president in 2012, but that two-year term expired in February 2014, well before the Houthi invasion of Sanaa in September of that year. As such, for many (particularly but not only in the north), he no longer has any legal basis to claim a position of authority in the Yemeni government. The United Nations and other regimes may see little alternative to Hadi for the moment, but it is crucial for a peaceful transition in Yemen to remember that many Yemenis do not share that view.  And while Yemen\u2019s \u201clegitimate\u201d government periodically declares that Aden has been liberated, the more meaningful reality is that Hadi and his government remain in exile and much of Aden and the south remain unsafe. As the \u201ctemporary\u201d capital, Aden is highly divided, with few jobs and violence routine. Another major challenge is to move toward a much more inclusive process bybringing in diverse parties, most notably from the south. Southerners do not embrace Hadi as their representative, and indeed they are no longer united, if they ever were.", "Bringing in southern voices directly into the peace talks would increase the possibility of reaching an ultimate arrangement that might accommodate some of their concerns.

After over a year since the start of Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm against Yemen none of Saudi Arabian objectives have been actualized. Riyadh also failed to impose its will for restoring to power in Sana'a the ousted Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansour who with the ministers of his government currently lives in the Saudi capital. The kingdom also failed to force Ansarulah out of the Yemeni capital, as Riyadh\u2019s efforts to push the Yemeni group to hand over heavy weapons to the government of Mansour Hadi met with failure.", "- Increased US pressures on Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia shifted stance towards the Yemenis after Washington has put strains on Riyadh to strike ISIS and Al-Qaeda positions and make a deal with Ansarulah. The US thinks that even a show war against terrorism could get Saudi Arabia out of Yemen quagmire.", "The US pressures on the Saudis saw a pick after Washington threatened that should the kingdom refused negotiations with Ansarulah and did not set high on the agenda fight against terrorism, it would stop operations of coordination, information exchange and target determination with Saudi war command posts.", "- The UAE asks US for help. Responding to the UAE\u2019s demands, the US Department of Defense has deployed 200 special forces to Yemen\u2019s south to help fight Al-Qaeda terrorist organization in Yemen. Although this is illegal and would not exempt the US and the UAE from their occupation responsibilities, it could work against Riyadh as the two Arab countries are in rivalry in Yemen.", "- Increased ISIS and Al-Qaeda power. The fighter jets belonging to the Arab states of the Saudi-led military coalition have refrained from striking the positions of ISIS and Al-Qaeda in Yemen. On the other side, some countries of the Arab coalition have sent weapons to these two terror groups. All these have bolstered the strength of the terrorists in the war-torn Yemen. The terror groups also lunched effective operations in Hardhramaut and Aden provinces, assassinating some politicians and military commanders, and attacking army bases and pro-Mansour Hadi forces.", "Based on what was given, it can be noted that Saudi Arabia has shaken up its priority list in the region though in practice its war on Ansarulah and the Yemeni army is under way. But this Saudi adventure is highly risky because attacks on Al-Qaeda and ISIS which mean opening new fronts, while the kingdom has not concluded the war at the first fronts, could break Saudi Arabia\u2019s efforts and thus result in heavy losses.", "Generally, it must be said that Saudi Arabia has launched a full-scale war against Yemen and pounded the country point by point. But now signs of losing the war began to appear to Riyadh. The Syrian crisis has also reached a decisive juncture now and Saudi Arabia is afraid to lose interests in the country. All these factors pushed a decision by the Saudis to seek settlement for Yemen\u2019s crisis. The Saudis see loss in both Syrian and Yemeni fronts a disgrace for Riyadh across the world. But a small success in Syria could save their face and make up for Yemen loss.", "It appears that Saudi Arabia\u2019s change is coming with a Western and American advice as they seek mobilization of their whole strength to focus on Syrian fronts, otherwise; the Saudis are those who opposed even a limited participation of Ansarulah in Yemen\u2019s future government and politics.", "Consequently, the Saudi stance shift is only tactical in a bid to move from one front to the other in the region to save face.", "http://alwaght.com/en/News/54435", "24.5.2016 \u2013 Fars News (** A K P)", "Saudi Whistle-Blower: Bin Salman Ready to Make Extensive Concessions to Ansarullah", "Saudi whistle-blower Mujtahid, who is believed to be a member of or have a well-connected source in the royal family, revealed that Deputy Crown Prince and Defense Minister Mohammad bin Salman has ordered the country's representatives in Yemen peace talks to give extensive concessions to Ansarullah to get rid of Yemen war.", "\"After facing problems in Yemen peace talks in Kuwait, Bin Salman entrusted the Saudi ambassador with negotiations with Ansarullah and ordered the Yemeni delegation (affiliated to fugitive President Mansour Hadi) to remain committed to the ambassador's agreements with Ansarullah,\" Mujtahid wrote on his tweeter page on Tuesday.", "According to the whistleblower, the Saudi envoy has told Ansarullah that Riyadh will withdraw from its demands embedded in the UN resolution and will make other concessions in return for Ansarullah's ending its operations at Yemen-Saudi Arabia bordering areas while Ansarullah will remain in the regions under its control and will not be asked to lay down its weapons.", "Also among other concessions offered by Bin Salman, Mansour Hadi will return to Yemen to remain a president as a formality until the formation of a national unity government in which Ansarullah will have a major say and a major share as large as the regions under its control.", "But according to Mujtahid, Ansarullah still raised more demands, including compensation for tens of billion of dollars of the destruction left in Yemen by the Saudi-led war, which he said was also agreed by Bin Salman in principle provided that it will remain a secret and will be made within the framework of a national meeting to reconstruct Yemen.", "In relevant remarks last month, Mujtahid had revealed that bin Salman is making serious efforts to put an end to the war in Yemen in order to get rid of the quagmire he has created for the Riyadh regime.", "Mujtahid underlined that the Saudi crown prince feels so helpless that he is ready to ignore the Saudi regime's conditions for ending the war on Yemen, including its insistence on the withdrawal and disarmament of Ansarullah forces as well as recognition of Mansour Hadi as Yemen's legal president.", "The Saudi tweeter noted that the large number of the Saudi soldiers killed in the war, the UAE troops pullout, the frequent blames put on Bin Salman for the spread of Al-Qaeda terrorists in Yemen and massacre of thousands of Yemeni civilians are among the strongest causes of deputy crown prince's helplessness and destitute.", "http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13950304000451", "Comment: This already had been reported by an Asian news channel (see YPR 147) without naming the source.
