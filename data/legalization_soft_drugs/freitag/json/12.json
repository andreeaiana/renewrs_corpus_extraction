The public and high-profile statement alongside Ban Ki-moon is an indication of widespread fears that the recent attacks against hospitals in Afghanistan and Yemen could weaken and perhaps destroy the laws of war, now called humanitarian law.", "Standing next to Ban Ki-moon, Peter Maurer said, \u201cIf States, other actors in conflict, and the international community as a whole do not act responsibly now, there will be millions more victims. Acting responsibly means redoubling efforts to achieve political solutions and, pending such achievements, ensuring that humanitarian principles and law are respected. Hospitals are being attacked, patients, doctors, nurses and humanitarian workers killed. When humanitarian law and principles are disregarded, when humanitarian needs are trumped by political agendas, when access to the wounded and sick is denied, and when security concerns lead to a suspension of operations, people are abandoned, the notion of protection loses its meaning, and humanity is flouted.\u201d", "The Association of World Citizens (AWC) was active in efforts that led to the treaty on the ban of cluster munitions. In a narrow sense, treaties are only binding on the States that have ratified the treaty. The US, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Russia have not yet ratified the cluster munitions ban. Thus, Saudi use of US-made cluster munitions in Yemen is \u201clegal,\u201d as is Russian use in Syria. However, the world citizen position is that when a large number of States ratify a treaty and that the treaty is constantly used as a standard in the UN\u2014as is the case of the cluster munitions ban\u2014then the treaty becomes world law. The cluster munitions use in Yemen and Syria is a violation of world law.", "The essential character of world law is that it is the broadly agreed upon rule of moral conduct. Although no significant revision of international humanitarian law is envisaged at the present, there is a constant need to reflect upon what actions are needed to adapt, promote and implement humanitarian law in the face of the changing realities of armed conflict. Above all, we need to look at what we can do when there are violations of humanitarian law by State military or by non-State agents such as ISIS.", "For the moment, the most direct and open violation of the core elements of humanitarian law\u2014the protection of hospitals, medical personnel and the wounded\u2014has been by State actors: the US in Afghanistan and the Saudi-led coalition (Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates) in Yemen. There is an obvious lack of political will to deal with violations of humanitarian law. The US is powerful, and most of the Saudi-led coalition is rich and active buyers of weapons.

Saudi Arabia, with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in tow, has been will-nilly bombing its southern neighbour since March to restore President Mansour Hadi\u2019s rule. Here, the Houthi rebels stand accused of usurping the people\u2019s choice, but no one cares that they may have genuine grievances or that Hadi got elected in 2012 by default because major opposition groups boycotted the polls.", "Why, you ask? One word: money. Five thousand people have died in Yemen since the Saudi offensive began but Obama has consistently ignored this humanitarian crisis in favour of railing against Assad. That, dear friends, is the power of oil in action. Also, other than Russia, no one questions the UN Security Council Resolution 2216 on Yemen, which is essentially a Saudi policy facsimile. It orders the Houthi rebels to disarm and give back territory without mandating the GCC to cease-fire.", "The bigger problem, however, is what will rise from the ruins in Yemen. On-ground reports suggest that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has dug in for the long haul by moving into territory vacated by either Hadi loyalists or the Houthi rebels. AQAP has ostensibly shored up tribal support in southeastern Yemen and now controls the Hadramout province, including the key port of Al-Mukalla. Like IS in Afghanistan, it is filling the public works vacuum to gain local support and the UN World Food Program gives Hadramout high marks for relative food and fuel availability.", "Katherine Zimmerman of the American Enterprise Institute believes, \u201cThe problems in Yemen are long-term grievances against the Yemeni state,\u201d adding, \u201cThat is what is behind the current civil war.\u201d Unfortunately, as the war drags on and a central government is nonexistent, militant groups like AQAP have the perfect opportunity to create and defend safe havens.

Taiz currently is on the front line in this brutal war, with a Saudi blockade, a Houthi local siege, air strikes from the Saudi-led coalition, and a ferocious ground war. The city of Taiz has politically favoured the Islah party in the past, which is at odds with Saleh and the Houthis, and hence apart from the geographic position in between North and South Yemen, it also has political antagonisms. Taiz polarises opinions - despite the fact that the war is between Salafist militias, Islah militias, local militias, Houthi militias, and part of the Yemen army loyal to Saleh, many in Taiz are hard line and insist all of the damage is done by Houthis. Whilst those in Sanaa tell me that Taiz is no worse than any other city and the only blockade is Saudi led, and they cry crocodile tears. This is a sign of the animosity that this war has created, that has to be overcome if Yemen is ever to have peace. As for Saudi, the Houthi siege is a gift. They could airdrop food and medical supplies into Taiz, but they only drop weapons to Salafist Abu Al Abbas. They want Taiz to starve and suffer, so that if and when Saudi coalition ground troops arrive, they will be welcomed with open arms - they will then flood it with goods, as they did in Aden, and win popularity", "https://www.facebook.com/yemennewstodayenglish/posts/1050267911792366", "8.11.2015 \u2013 Kare 11", "Besieged hospitals in Yemen lack vital supplies (Film)", "http://www.kare11.com/video/4602103512001/1/Besieged-hospitals-in-Yemen-lack-vital-supplies", "5.11.2015 \u2013 IRIN", "Will Yemen\u2019s storm yet prove disastrous?", "Yemen has a major water shortage \u2013 an estimated 80 percent of its citizens are thought to be using unsafe water for their daily needs \u2013 but years of rain in two days is hardly what it needs.", "The dry hard terrain of Hadramaut and Shawbah provinces, which were hit the hardest, won\u2019t be able to absorb the water, causing floods and the potential for standing water.
