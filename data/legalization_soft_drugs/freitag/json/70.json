It\u2019s true that this development is very significant for the armed group because it all but precludes the commencement of any more offensives against the territory under its control, which could potentially lead to the stabilization of the front lines and the beginning of a global aid campaign to relieve the suffering that millions of people are experiencing in what has previously been recognized as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. In fact, the UAE probably wouldn\u2019t have done this had they and their Saudi allies succeeded in taking the strategic Ansar Allah-held port of Hodeidah, the failure of which set into motion the subsequent events that led to its decision to withdraw most of its forces from Yemen.", "The Ansar Allah And The STC", "The Ansar Allah might have begun as a rural peripheral rebellion among the religious minorities of Yemen\u2019s northern mountainous region but it\u2019s since evolved into a much more inclusive movement that convincingly has the trappings of a national liberation one, especially after allying with the Yemeni Army in seeking the expulsion of all foreign forces from the country. By comparison, the \u201cinternationally recognized\u201d government of President Hadi enjoys close to no domestic support whatsoever and has basically functioned as little more than an excuse to justify the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s military intervention against the Ansar Allah. The supposed bastion of its support, the southern port of Aden, is more under the control of the Southern Resistance Forces (SRF, the armed wing of the Southern Transitional Council [STC]) that want to restore the Old Cold War-era independence of South Yemen than it is Hadi\u2019s, which in and of itself hints at the most politically realistic outcome of this conflict in the wake of the UAE\u2019s withdrawal.", "\u201cFederalization\u201d", "With the Ansar Allah in control of the most demographically and economically significant portions of the former nation of North Yemen (officially the \u201cYemen Arab Republic\u201d from 1962-1990) and the STC wielding UAE-backed sovereignty over South Yemen (officially the \u201cPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic of Yemen\u201d from 1967-1990), the quickest way to end the war would be to institutionalize Yemen\u2019s already existing military and political divisions via the implementation of a \u201cfederal\u201d model that de-facto recognizes this state of affairs since neither side has the wherewithal to surmount the stalemate that\u2019s set in. That scenario, however, is far from the \u201cvictory\u201d that the Ansar Allah originally hoped to achieve even though it satisfies most of what the STC and its Emirati patron want, all of which would nevertheless further complicate Saudi Arabia\u2019s security situation along its southern border if it turns out that the Kingdom doesn\u2019t have anything to show for its costly campaign other than the Ansar Allah\u2019s \u201cautonomy\u201d over North Yemen and its \u201clittle brother\u2019s\u201d (UAE) new proxy state in the south.", "Concluding Thoughts", "Bearing in mind all that was touched upon in this analysis, one can say that while every other participant in the war achieved some (Ansar Allah, UAE) or practically all (STC) of its objectives, the Saudis didn\u2019t succeed with anything other than preventing the Ansar Allah\u2019s full takeover of Yemen. The Kingdom\u2019s security situation is worse than when the conflict began and it no longer has any direct influence in its neighbor, instead having to rely on its \u201clittle brother\u201d to maintain its presence in parts of South Yemen. Without the UAE doing the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d, it\u2019s all but inevitable that Saudi Arabia will scramble for a \u201cface-saving\u201d exit from the war as well since it\u2019s proven itself unable to alter the dynamics in is favor on its own, especially when most of what it\u2019s been doing is bombing Yemen and never really fighting on the ground and holding territory like its allies have. Even though the Ansar Allah can\u2019t be said to have won the civil-international Yemeni War since it doesn\u2019t control the entire country, it didn\u2019t lose it either, with that ignoble distinction being the Saudis\u2019 alone -by Andrew Korybko", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/did-ansar-allah-really-just-win-yemeni-war/5685403", "My remark: More on this topic, cp2.", "(** B E K P)", "Prohibiting Maintenance of Tanker Off Yemeni Coast, Saudis Risk Explosion and Environmental Disaster", "\u201cWe are talking about a huge floating tanker that entered service in Yemen 30 years ago, which contains more than one million tons of oil.

They say that ship\u2019s boilers and coolers have been stopped owing to a lack of diesel fuel and the body of the tanker is beginning to suffer from corrosion following multiple failed efforts to unload its cargo of crude oil.", "According to Yemeni officials, if an urgent rescue operation is not launched, the vessel could create an environmental disaster four times greater than the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in history.", "In 2015, when the Saudi-led Coalition military campaign began in Yemen, Saudi Arabia prevented the oil-laden vessel from leaving Hodeida port and forced crew members to abandon it, leaving important maintenance work undone and creating what is essentially a floating time bomb. Since the vessel was abandoned, the Coalition has repeatedly prevented other ships from refueling the tanker with diesel to operate its generators used for cooling and to discharge gas emitted by the crude oil.", "An oil spill in the Red Sea port would potentially destroy marine ecosystems and pose a threat to coastal tourism. Worst of all, officials say, it could leave millions of people in Hodeida district without clean drinking water. Experts at IR Consilium, a consultancy firm focusing on maritime law and security, warned that a spill in the area would force multiple desalination plants surrounding the Red Sea to close, depriving millions of access to drinking water.", "Moreover, an oil spill could also shutter Yemen\u2019s Hodeida port, the gateway for 90 percent of the country\u2019s food, medical and aid supplies, by strangling traffic on one of the world\u2019s main waterways, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. Such a spill would have a tangible impact on the world economy, according to a recent report published by the Atlantic Council. The Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis blame each other for failing to reach an agreement over the fate of the tanker. The Houthis want guarantees that the revenue from the oil aboard the tanker \u2014 estimated at more than $70 million, as noted above \u2014 will go to pay the salaries of Yemen\u2019s public-sector employees and be used to restore power to the province of Hodeida.", "The Coalition wants the revenue to be kept by Coalition countries, much as the oil revenues from Yemen\u2019s southern regions where Saudi Arabia and the UAE are extracting oil from Shabwa, Balahaf and Hadramout and transferring the revenues to the National Bank in Saudi Arabia.", "Mark Lowcock, the UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, pointed out that this was additionally frustrating because Houthi authorities had actually contacted the UN in early 2018 requesting assistance with the tanker and promising to facilitate their [UN] work.", "Saudi Coalition countries and their local allies have recently revived the controversy surrounding the Safer FSO, claiming that rescue of the ship justifies a military campaign to seize control of the area and blaming the Houthis for ship\u2019s condition.

It\u2019s true that this development is very significant for the armed group because it all but precludes the commencement of any more offensives against the territory under its control, which could potentially lead to the stabilization of the front lines and the beginning of a global aid campaign to relieve the suffering that millions of people are experiencing in what has previously been recognized as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.

By comparison, the \u201cinternationally recognized\u201d government of President Hadi enjoys close to no domestic support whatsoever and has basically functioned as little more than an excuse to justify the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s military intervention against the Ansar Allah. The supposed bastion of its support, the southern port of Aden, is more under the control of the Southern Resistance Forces (SRF, the armed wing of the Southern Transitional Council [STC]) that want to restore the Old Cold War-era independence of South Yemen than it is Hadi\u2019s, which in and of itself hints at the most politically realistic outcome of this conflict in the wake of the UAE\u2019s withdrawal.", "\u201cFederalization\u201d", "With the Ansar Allah in control of the most demographically and economically significant portions of the former nation of North Yemen (officially the \u201cYemen Arab Republic\u201d from 1962-1990) and the STC wielding UAE-backed sovereignty over South Yemen (officially the \u201cPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic of Yemen\u201d from 1967-1990), the quickest way to end the war would be to institutionalize Yemen\u2019s already existing military and political divisions via the implementation of a \u201cfederal\u201d model that de-facto recognizes this state of affairs since neither side has the wherewithal to surmount the stalemate that\u2019s set in. That scenario, however, is far from the \u201cvictory\u201d that the Ansar Allah originally hoped to achieve even though it satisfies most of what the STC and its Emirati patron want, all of which would nevertheless further complicate Saudi Arabia\u2019s security situation along its southern border if it turns out that the Kingdom doesn\u2019t have anything to show for its costly campaign other than the Ansar Allah\u2019s \u201cautonomy\u201d over North Yemen and its \u201clittle brother\u2019s\u201d (UAE) new proxy state in the south.", "Concluding Thoughts", "Bearing in mind all that was touched upon in this analysis, one can say that while every other participant in the war achieved some (Ansar Allah, UAE) or practically all (STC) of its objectives, the Saudis didn\u2019t succeed with anything other than preventing the Ansar Allah\u2019s full takeover of Yemen.
