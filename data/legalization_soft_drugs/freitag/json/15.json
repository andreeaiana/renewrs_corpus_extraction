Moreover, one of the few milestones achieved \u2013 the return of Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed to the interim capital of Aden \u2013 was put into doubt as he left to Riyadh last week amid heightened tensions between government and STC-aligned forces.", "The committees that the STC has suspended its participation in relate to the military and security components of the Riyadh Agreement, while the political component is being handled directly by the lead delegates of the Yemeni government and STC. These three components of the agreement are interrelated. The committees on the ground are supposed to be overseeing the crucial reforming of the security and military sectors, and there is unlikely to be progress on the political aspects of the agreement until that happens, which is why the prime minister left to Riyadh.", "One of the most contentious points surrounding the implementation of the security and military annexes of the Riyadh Agreement is the repositioning of military forces, particularly from Shaqra area in Abyan, where President Hadi has strong loyalists in close proximity to Aden. On February 8, STC-aligned security forces in Aden prevented government forces from relocating to Lahj governorate, demanding the withdrawal of a separate unit in Shaqra.

The following day, the STC issued a statement stressing its keenness to have a strong partnership with the coalition, particularly Saudi Arabia.

The bedrock of the UAE\u2019s \u201cPeace First\u201d strategy is a switch from direct to indirect engagement in the country through increased reliance on local proxies and partners, as the deputy chief of staff of the UAE\u2019s armed forces, Lt. Gen. Eisa Saif al-Mazrouei, recently reiterated.", "Direct engagement", "Before its phased withdrawal strategy \u2014 initially introduced as a military drawdown in July 2019 \u2014 the UAE publicly and directly fought two primary enemies: first, the Houthis as part of the Arab coalition, and second, violent extremist groups, most notably al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and ISIS, with the U.S.", "In countering the second threat of violent extremism, the UAE pushed AQAP out of the port city of Mukalla in 2016 using a combination of peaceful and coercive tactics, and it also trained local units, most notably the Security Belt Forces (SBF).", "Interestingly, the UAE, according to al-Mazrouei, has also combated a third enemy: \u201cthe Muslim Brotherhood and their fifth column.\u201d While this might not be surprising given the UAE\u2019s well-known hostility toward political Islamist groups more broadly, and the Muslim Brotherhood in particular, the question is when such a motive became prominent. Most likely, the April 2016 appointment of Lt. Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar \u2014 who is widely perceived to be pro-Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 as the replacement for Vice President Khaled Mahfoudh Bahah, who was a consensus figure locally, regionally, and internationally, prompted the UAE to reassess its Yemen policy.", "Instead of speeding up its withdrawal, the UAE strategically laid the groundwork for its indirect engagement, along the lines of Libya, by creating an array of counterbalancing local forces \u2014 including the Southern Transitional Council (STC) in May 2017. These forces weakened the rule of the Yemeni government in the liberated territories, diverted the coalition\u2019s focus from fighting the Houthis to fighting the Houthis and Islah, and, consequently, created intra-coalition divisions as a result.", "Indirect engagement after phased withdrawal", "Five years on, the UAE has control over several non-state armed groups, thought to total around 90,000 fighters across the liberated territories, which it supports by providing direct training, capacity building, logistics assistance, and salaries.", "By formalizing the STC as an active Yemeni player through the conclusion of the Riyadh Agreement, Abu Dhabi ensured that its southern proxy would have a legitimate role in the country\u2019s future prior to completing its withdrawal.", "Implications of Emirati withdrawal", "The UAE\u2019s withdrawal has significant implications for the trajectories of both the conflict and the peace process. First, the UAE\u2019s military withdrawal, coupled with the significant Sudanese drawdown from more than 15,000 to just over 650 personnel, will further isolate Saudi Arabia in Yemen, thus increasing the external pressure on the kingdom.", "Second, the Yemeni government has become more fragile not necessarily as a result of the UAE\u2019s withdrawal per se, but primarily because of the inheritance Abu Dhabi left behind: local groups in possession of heavy weapons and mixed ambitions with contested territorial control.", "Third, the Saudi-led coalition now officially has competing wings that are fighting different battles against several enemies, including each other, ultimately benefiting the Houthis.", "Fourth, Abu Dhabi is highly likely to continue counterterrorism engagement, in cooperation with the U.S. and local proxies on the ground, given that it, according to Mazrouei, has not officially suspended its membership in the coalition, for symbolic and security reasons.", "Fifth, the UAE will remain an important player in conflict resolution efforts, considering its close ties with the armed factions it supports across the liberated territories. While the UAE\u2019s withdrawal will help to mollify its international critics and partly repair its damaged reputation, Abu Dhabi will retain significant influence with the STC, the political umbrella group bringing together several armed factions in the south.", "Therefore, it is clear that the UAE\u2019s withdrawal will not reduce its influence in Yemen for the foreseeable future. Abu Dhabi will continue be important to the trajectories of both the conflict and the peace process, especially given its patron-client relationship with the entities its sponsors \u2014 a dynamic that is itself unlikely to change in the short to medium term.

In short, very little. While al-Raymi was, by some accounts, a skilled tactician, his influence within the organization was never as pronounced as that of his predecessor, Nasir al-Wuhayshi. While this partly reflects the different styles and core competencies of the two leaders, more importantly, it reflects the fact that AQAP has moved away from relying on a hierarchical core for leadership. [1] Instead, it is implementing an atomized organizational structure that empowers local operatives. [2] AQAP has also reordered its priorities and objectives.", "Such changes began as early as 2017. They were a response to the increased pressure from coalition-backed forces and the fluid socio-political environment that AQAP must navigate. [3] While AQAP maintains a veneer of ideology, it has long since deprioritized imposing strict interpretations of sharia, holding territory, and carrying out attacks on foreign targets. Instead, AQAP\u2019s focus is parochial and pragmatic. [4]", "One of AQAP\u2019s core strategies is the seeding of its operatives and fighters throughout Yemen\u2019s disparate collection of security forces and militias. AQAP fighters have been knowingly and unknowingly recruited into many of these forces which operate throughout south Yemen and in pockets of territory in northern Yemen. Various fighting forces\u2014even those opposed to one another\u2014value these operatives and fighters for their expertise, discipline, and, in some cases, for their ability to access dark networks (Terrorism Monitor, January 26, 2018). AQAP and the Islamic State in Yemen (ISY) have benefited directly and indirectly from the involvement of the UAE and Saudi Arabia in Yemen. Both countries have, at times, de-prioritized battling AQAP in favor of fighting the Houthis and pursuing their own objectives in Yemen (The New Arab, June 12, 2018; al-Jazeera, August 6, 2018). AQAP-linked fighters fight alongside many of Yemen\u2019s militias and security forces, most notably in the still-contested city of Taiz and in the governorates of Marib and al-Jawf. [5]", "The seeding and even the hiring out of its fighters to various militias is a way of securing influence, funds, and access to illicit trade networks. All of these are fundamental to AQAP\u2019s long-term survival and to the survival of its operatives. AQAP has followed the tactical and strategic moves that have been made by many terrorist and insurgent groups.", "Just as war drives innovation and change in war-fighting technologies, it also supercharges the evolution of insurgent and terrorist groups. An organization\u2019s failure to change in response to the dynamic environment in which it operates likely portends its end. AQAP\u2019s resilience is a testament to the group\u2019s ability to remake itself. The complexity of Yemen\u2019s interlocking wars and the prolonged involvement of outside powers mean that AQAP has been forced to evolve into a more diffuse organization. This will impact the \u201cAQAP\u201d brand and may mean that AQAP becomes something of a constellation of loosely allied groups in Yemen. At the same time, AQAP will be less legible than it has been in the past. This lack of legibility is very much in its interest as it attempts to evade counter-terrorism efforts, access illicit networks, and profit from Yemen\u2019s wars. AQAP\u2019s evolution may point toward how the next wave of insurgent and terrorist groups will operate.

Moreover, one of the few milestones achieved \u2013 the return of Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed to the interim capital of Aden \u2013 was put into doubt as he left to Riyadh last week amid heightened tensions between government and STC-aligned forces.", "The committees that the STC has suspended its participation in relate to the military and security components of the Riyadh Agreement, while the political component is being handled directly by the lead delegates of the Yemeni government and STC. These three components of the agreement are interrelated. The committees on the ground are supposed to be overseeing the crucial reforming of the security and military sectors, and there is unlikely to be progress on the political aspects of the agreement until that happens, which is why the prime minister left to Riyadh.", "One of the most contentious points surrounding the implementation of the security and military annexes of the Riyadh Agreement is the repositioning of military forces, particularly from Shaqra area in Abyan, where President Hadi has strong loyalists in close proximity to Aden. On February 8, STC-aligned security forces in Aden prevented government forces from relocating to Lahj governorate, demanding the withdrawal of a separate unit in Shaqra.

The following day, the STC issued a statement stressing its keenness to have a strong partnership with the coalition, particularly Saudi Arabia.

The bedrock of the UAE\u2019s \u201cPeace First\u201d strategy is a switch from direct to indirect engagement in the country through increased reliance on local proxies and partners, as the deputy chief of staff of the UAE\u2019s armed forces, Lt.

Most likely, the April 2016 appointment of Lt. Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar \u2014 who is widely perceived to be pro-Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 as the replacement for Vice President Khaled Mahfoudh Bahah, who was a consensus figure locally, regionally, and internationally, prompted the UAE to reassess its Yemen policy.", "Instead of speeding up its withdrawal, the UAE strategically laid the groundwork for its indirect engagement, along the lines of Libya, by creating an array of counterbalancing local forces \u2014 including the Southern Transitional Council (STC) in May 2017. These forces weakened the rule of the Yemeni government in the liberated territories, diverted the coalition\u2019s focus from fighting the Houthis to fighting the Houthis and Islah, and, consequently, created intra-coalition divisions as a result.", "Indirect engagement after phased withdrawal", "Five years on, the UAE has control over several non-state armed groups, thought to total around 90,000 fighters across the liberated territories, which it supports by providing direct training, capacity building, logistics assistance, and salaries.", "By formalizing the STC as an active Yemeni player through the conclusion of the Riyadh Agreement, Abu Dhabi ensured that its southern proxy would have a legitimate role in the country\u2019s future prior to completing its withdrawal.", "Implications of Emirati withdrawal", "The UAE\u2019s withdrawal has significant implications for the trajectories of both the conflict and the peace process. First, the UAE\u2019s military withdrawal, coupled with the significant Sudanese drawdown from more than 15,000 to just over 650 personnel, will further isolate Saudi Arabia in Yemen, thus increasing the external pressure on the kingdom.", "Second, the Yemeni government has become more fragile not necessarily as a result of the UAE\u2019s withdrawal per se, but primarily because of the inheritance Abu Dhabi left behind: local groups in possession of heavy weapons and mixed ambitions with contested territorial control.", "Third, the Saudi-led coalition now officially has competing wings that are fighting different battles against several enemies, including each other, ultimately benefiting the Houthis.", "Fourth, Abu Dhabi is highly likely to continue counterterrorism engagement, in cooperation with the U.S. and local proxies on the ground, given that it, according to Mazrouei, has not officially suspended its membership in the coalition, for symbolic and security reasons.", "Fifth, the UAE will remain an important player in conflict resolution efforts, considering its close ties with the armed factions it supports across the liberated territories. While the UAE\u2019s withdrawal will help to mollify its international critics and partly repair its damaged reputation, Abu Dhabi will retain significant influence with the STC, the political umbrella group bringing together several armed factions in the south.", "Therefore, it is clear that the UAE\u2019s withdrawal will not reduce its influence in Yemen for the foreseeable future. Abu Dhabi will continue be important to the trajectories of both the conflict and the peace process, especially given its patron-client relationship with the entities its sponsors \u2014 a dynamic that is itself unlikely to change in the short to medium term.

In short, very little. While al-Raymi was, by some accounts, a skilled tactician, his influence within the organization was never as pronounced as that of his predecessor, Nasir al-Wuhayshi. While this partly reflects the different styles and core competencies of the two leaders, more importantly, it reflects the fact that AQAP has moved away from relying on a hierarchical core for leadership. [1] Instead, it is implementing an atomized organizational structure that empowers local operatives. [2] AQAP has also reordered its priorities and objectives.", "Such changes began as early as 2017. They were a response to the increased pressure from coalition-backed forces and the fluid socio-political environment that AQAP must navigate. [3] While AQAP maintains a veneer of ideology, it has long since deprioritized imposing strict interpretations of sharia, holding territory, and carrying out attacks on foreign targets. Instead, AQAP\u2019s focus is parochial and pragmatic. [4]", "One of AQAP\u2019s core strategies is the seeding of its operatives and fighters throughout Yemen\u2019s disparate collection of security forces and militias. AQAP fighters have been knowingly and unknowingly recruited into many of these forces which operate throughout south Yemen and in pockets of territory in northern Yemen. Various fighting forces\u2014even those opposed to one another\u2014value these operatives and fighters for their expertise, discipline, and, in some cases, for their ability to access dark networks (Terrorism Monitor, January 26, 2018). AQAP and the Islamic State in Yemen (ISY) have benefited directly and indirectly from the involvement of the UAE and Saudi Arabia in Yemen. Both countries have, at times, de-prioritized battling AQAP in favor of fighting the Houthis and pursuing their own objectives in Yemen (The New Arab, June 12, 2018; al-Jazeera, August 6, 2018). AQAP-linked fighters fight alongside many of Yemen\u2019s militias and security forces, most notably in the still-contested city of Taiz and in the governorates of Marib and al-Jawf. [5]", "The seeding and even the hiring out of its fighters to various militias is a way of securing influence, funds, and access to illicit trade networks. All of these are fundamental to AQAP\u2019s long-term survival and to the survival of its operatives. AQAP has followed the tactical and strategic moves that have been made by many terrorist and insurgent groups.", "Just as war drives innovation and change in war-fighting technologies, it also supercharges the evolution of insurgent and terrorist groups. An organization\u2019s failure to change in response to the dynamic environment in which it operates likely portends its end. AQAP\u2019s resilience is a testament to the group\u2019s ability to remake itself. The complexity of Yemen\u2019s interlocking wars and the prolonged involvement of outside powers mean that AQAP has been forced to evolve into a more diffuse organization. This will impact the \u201cAQAP\u201d brand and may mean that AQAP becomes something of a constellation of loosely allied groups in Yemen. At the same time, AQAP will be less legible than it has been in the past. This lack of legibility is very much in its interest as it attempts to evade counter-terrorism efforts, access illicit networks, and profit from Yemen\u2019s wars. AQAP\u2019s evolution may point toward how the next wave of insurgent and terrorist groups will operate.
