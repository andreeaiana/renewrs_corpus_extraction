Sentiment against the country\u2019s presence in the war has persisted within Sudan\u2019s government and the wider population, including members of the political movement that would eventually help topple the Bashir regime in April 2019 (Radio Dabanga, April 30, 2019).", "Normalization: Sudanese-style", "Just four months after the revolution, despite aspirations of reform, reports surfaced of possible additional Sudanese deployments to a separate conflict altogether, in Libya (Africa News, July 17, 2019). For the time being, it appeared the old regime\u2019s patterns had remained in place. Some Yemen experts believed Sudan\u2019s post-revolution government was still too military-dominated for the country to buck the trend and withdraw its troops from overseas (Al Araby, September 13, 2019).", "Nonetheless, a July 2019 deal for a new, post-revolution government arrangement established the position of prime minister, which was taken up by Abdullah Hamdok on August 21 (Gulf News, August 22, 2019).

Just days later, he followed these statements with an announcement that 10,000 troops had returned home to Sudan from Yemen (YouTube, December 9, 2019). In February 2020, a military spokesperson stated that Sudan\u2019s force in Yemen had been reduced further to just 657 soldiers (Press TV, February 10; Al-Monitor, February 3).

For roughly five years, tens of thousands of Sudanese troops (including youths in their early teens) cycled in and out of deployments, often engaging in the heaviest of the fighting. Many Sudanese sought out the mission in Yemen for its high rate of pay, which posed an alluring sum in Sudan\u2019s dire economy (Al-Jazeera, December 29, 2018).", "While Sudan\u2019s regular military mostly deployed to the border areas between Yemen and Saudi Arabia, it was the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) from Darfur, led by Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, (a.k.a \u201cHemedti\u201d), who were deployed directly inside Yemen (Middle East Eye, December 22, 2019).", "The mission was unpopular, and while exact casualty numbers are unknown, Houthi rebels claim 4,000 Sudanese troops have been killed and other accounts indicate that upwards of 3,700 have been wounded (Press TV, November 2, 2019; Middle East Eye, November 10, 2019). Sentiment against the country\u2019s presence in the war has persisted within Sudan\u2019s government and the wider population, including members of the political movement that would eventually help topple the Bashir regime in April 2019 (Radio Dabanga, April 30, 2019).", "Normalization: Sudanese-style", "Just four months after the revolution, despite aspirations of reform, reports surfaced of possible additional Sudanese deployments to a separate conflict altogether, in Libya (Africa News, July 17, 2019). For the time being, it appeared the old regime\u2019s patterns had remained in place. Some Yemen experts believed Sudan\u2019s post-revolution government was still too military-dominated for the country to buck the trend and withdraw its troops from overseas (Al Araby, September 13, 2019).", "Nonetheless, a July 2019 deal for a new, post-revolution government arrangement established the position of prime minister, which was taken up by Abdullah Hamdok on August 21 (Gulf News, August 22, 2019). Hamdok began his tenure by quickly moving to establish himself as a normalizing figure,", "Hamdok repeatedly stated that Sudan would reduce its role as a destabilizing factor in its region and draw down its involvement in foreign wars (Middle East Eye, December 15, 2019; YouTube, December 5, 2019). Just days later, he followed these statements with an announcement that 10,000 troops had returned home to Sudan from Yemen (YouTube, December 9, 2019). In February 2020, a military spokesperson stated that Sudan\u2019s force in Yemen had been reduced further to just 657 soldiers (Press TV, February 10; Al-Monitor, February 3). A new foreign policy had paralleled the transitional government\u2019s formative stage and set the tone for Hamdok\u2019s strategy.", "Meanwhile, in Libya, Sudan plays a much murkier role than in Yemen.", "One does not have to look far back into history\u2014or lingering current issues\u2014to see less preferable directions for Sudan\u2019s future. Sudan\u2019s wars are unpopular, and its principal benefactors (the RSF) are linked to some of the worst humans rights abuses of the 21st century.", "In this context, Hamdok will likely attempt to further limit the inherited Bashir-era arrangements that could damage Sudan\u2019s recovering reputation.", "Finally, the potential legitimacy gained from taking on popular public grievances\u2014indeed the cause of the April revolution\u2014 against the regime\u2019s self-serving war-making, could also ultimately help to shield Hamdok from military factions, who remain Hamdok\u2019s greatest threat, as demonstrated by a March 9 assassination attempt (Sudan Tribune, March 9; Middle East Eye, March 9) \u2013 by Cameron Evers", "https://jamestown.org/program/where-next-for-sudans-soldiers-of-fortune-army-withdrawal-from-yemen-signals-wider-reform/", "cp13a Waffenhandel / Arms trade", "(* B K P)", "Ending arms sales to parties to the conflict in Yemen: exploring CARE\u2019s advocacy in France, Germany and the United States", "As a humanitarian organisation, protecting civilians caught up in armed conflict is at the heart of CARE\u2019s mandate. As such, we consistently advocate for governments to use their political influence to urge warring parties to halt violations. Yet as the crisis in Yemen rages on, the diplomatic efforts of influential countries such as France, Germany and the United States are being undermined by the sale and transfer of weapons to parties to the conflict.", "With the Yemeni a population having been constantly under fire and no end to the crisis in sight, CARE determined that joining forces with civil society actors to call on these influential nations to stop putting civilian lives at risk and undermining peace by selling weapons to the parties waging war in Yemen was integral to upholding the humanitarian imperative of saving lives and alleviating suffering.", "France: challenging the system of export controls and building on public mobilisation", "CARE France is an active member of a coalition of human rights and humanitarian organisations advocating for increased transparency around arms sales and the suspension of arms transfers to parties to the conflict. A permanent parliamentary committee of enquiry ensures that France meets its international commitments under the Arms Trade Treaty and the European Union common position on arms exports. Although the French government submits an annual report on arms exports to parliament, French parliamentarians do not have the mandate or resources to control government action in an opaque system with little transparency around arms sales.", "Germany: keeping the German arms export stop in place", "In 2018 CARE Germany joined civil society actors in advocating against the sale of German arms to parties to the Yemen conflict and others. In late autumn, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a complete ban on all German arms exports to Saudi Arabia, including exports that had already been approved. The moratorium was subsequently renewed three times, before pressure from European partners led to the partial lifting of the export ban in March 2019. Germany has still stopped direct exports, but continues to contribute German parts to joint European arms sales.", "The decision to keep most of the moratorium in place is due at least in part to the commitment of CARE and other humanitarian agencies, which advocated with parliamentarians and spoke out publicly.", "The United States: aligning US policy in Yemen with the will of Congress and the American people", "Conclusion", "For CARE, advocacy involves a delicate balance: speaking truth to power(s) without compromising our ability to safely reach people in need. This requires a constant negotiation of humanitarian principles, weighing risks to our independence and neutrality while also considering the humanitarian imperative.", "The case of Yemen starkly illustrates the reality that aid alone cannot end the suffering of a population subjected to years of war. Yet continuous pleas for parties to the conflict to uphold the laws of war have yielded little change in the conduct of hostilities, and there is minimal incentive to prioritise a diplomatic solution despite the clear link between arms sales to parties to the conflict and the loss of countless lives, immeasurable suffering and decades-long impacts on Yemen\u2019s development \u2013 by Fanny Petitbon, Anica Heinlein, Dhabie Brown", "https://odihpn.org/magazine/ending-arms-sales-conflict-yemen-advocacy/", "(A K P)", "America and Western countries manufacture armored vehicles with the latest specifications.
