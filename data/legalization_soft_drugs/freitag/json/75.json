Solar energy is heavily used in the housing sector and others domains especially with petroleum-based products being very hard to acquire and expensive. The national power-grid provides around 1,500 megawatts, which only covers 40 percent of the population with city dwellers getting 85 percent of power, while the number drops drastically for rural areas, which gains only 23 percent. According to a May 2017 report by the Cairo-based Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, 75 percent of Yemeni families in the city and 50 percent rural areas use solar energy. In this regard, Minister of Electricity and Energy Mohammad Al-Anani said that there was an increase in the use of electro-solar systems in Yemen, adding that devices produced around 400 megawatts mostly utilized in houses for power. Between 2016 and 2018, the solar energy market saw a boom in exports and imports with USD 1.5 billion invested in this sector, he revealed. He added that this boom was mainly occurring in Houthi militia-controlled areas with 80 percent. Al-Anani said that most what is available in the market was of bad quality with the devices' batteries lasting a mere 16 months. The minister revealed that the legitimate government in Aden was embarking on a project to construct and connect Photovoltaic power stations with each station providing 5 to 50 megawatts. The project aims at providing electricity to mainly smaller cities and rural areas at four to seven hours each evening after charging all day, said the minister, adding that the cost will not exceed 40 percent of the citizens budget as oppose to other power sources such as fuel and diesel. Though solar energy is heavily used since 2011, the matter of fact is that most Yemenis use such power to attend to basic functions such as charging phones and operating televisions; therefore, it is important to extend the horizon of citizens and show them this technology could be used for other purposes, said minister Al-Anani. Meanwhile, solar energy specialist Salah Abdsalam revealed that though solar energy was in heavy demand, the ill-use of such resource was very common. The lack of knowledge on how to maintain solar energy devices sometimes creates a problem for some citizens and they pay more money they used pay to while using the government power-grid, he claimed. The economic validity of the solar powered systems is more prevalent at government institutes than with the common Yemeni citizen, affirmed Abdsalam.", "http://en.adenpress.news/news/11956", "(** B H K)", "Film: In this Besieged Yemen Town, Victims Share Hospital Beds and Graves [VIDEO]", "In the besieged Yemeni city of Durihimi, just south of Hodeidah\u2019s urban center, wounded people share beds and after death, they share graves.", "Civilians living in Hodeidah, especially small towns like Durihimi, have faced a devastating siege on a scale even more dire than the rest of the country since last summer when the US-Saudi coalition launched their invasion and assault to occupy Hodeidah port.

Complicity also involves, often principally, multiple non-Western states engaged in exacerbating mass violence, including major rival powers like Russia, as well as Muslim regimes such as the Gulf states, Iran and Turkey.", "Equally, this often does not obviate Western complicity in genocidal violence against Muslim groups. Complicity frequently extends to cases where Western powers may not be directly involved, but are nevertheless engaged in other mechanisms of indirect support.", "The coming tipping point", "The total number of Muslims who have died since 9/11 in wars for which Western states bear significant culpability is truly staggering. Unfortunately, while we can be reasonably certain of the direct death toll, the scale of indirect deaths remains unknown and we are forced to rely on probable estimates. These estimates are not suggested here as final, but rather as tentative, yet still plausible (and very likely highly conservative), figures which further urgent excess mortality research might be able to firm up.", "At a minimum, focusing purely on the minimum conservative figures based on direct deaths, around which there can be little room for doubt, we have an alarming direct death toll of around 1.2 million Muslims from post-9/11 conflicts in which Western powers along with Muslim regimes, terrorist groups and rival non-Western powers are complicit.", "However, these figures are not only likely to be a severe undercount on their own terms of the actual direct death toll; due to reliance on methods which tend to produce more conservative estimates, they do not account for the volume of deaths that will have been produced as an indirect consequence of wars due to the destruction of health, water and other critical infrastructure, and the impact of direct war casualties on societal functions; they also exclude certain conflicts, focusing on some more well-known conflicts", "This implies that total direct and indirect deaths of Muslims across these six theatres of war amounts to between 5.3 and 5.7 million people. The full statistical range suggests that at least 1.2 million and more likely just under 6 million Muslims have died in the sequence of regional conflicts since 9/11.

Solar energy is heavily used in the housing sector and others domains especially with petroleum-based products being very hard to acquire and expensive. The national power-grid provides around 1,500 megawatts, which only covers 40 percent of the population with city dwellers getting 85 percent of power, while the number drops drastically for rural areas, which gains only 23 percent. According to a May 2017 report by the Cairo-based Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, 75 percent of Yemeni families in the city and 50 percent rural areas use solar energy. In this regard, Minister of Electricity and Energy Mohammad Al-Anani said that there was an increase in the use of electro-solar systems in Yemen, adding that devices produced around 400 megawatts mostly utilized in houses for power. Between 2016 and 2018, the solar energy market saw a boom in exports and imports with USD 1.5 billion invested in this sector, he revealed. He added that this boom was mainly occurring in Houthi militia-controlled areas with 80 percent. Al-Anani said that most what is available in the market was of bad quality with the devices' batteries lasting a mere 16 months. The minister revealed that the legitimate government in Aden was embarking on a project to construct and connect Photovoltaic power stations with each station providing 5 to 50 megawatts. The project aims at providing electricity to mainly smaller cities and rural areas at four to seven hours each evening after charging all day, said the minister, adding that the cost will not exceed 40 percent of the citizens budget as oppose to other power sources such as fuel and diesel. Though solar energy is heavily used since 2011, the matter of fact is that most Yemenis use such power to attend to basic functions such as charging phones and operating televisions; therefore, it is important to extend the horizon of citizens and show them this technology could be used for other purposes, said minister Al-Anani. Meanwhile, solar energy specialist Salah Abdsalam revealed that though solar energy was in heavy demand, the ill-use of such resource was very common. The lack of knowledge on how to maintain solar energy devices sometimes creates a problem for some citizens and they pay more money they used pay to while using the government power-grid, he claimed. The economic validity of the solar powered systems is more prevalent at government institutes than with the common Yemeni citizen, affirmed Abdsalam.", "http://en.adenpress.news/news/11956", "(** B H K)", "Film: In this Besieged Yemen Town, Victims Share Hospital Beds and Graves [VIDEO]", "In the besieged Yemeni city of Durihimi, just south of Hodeidah\u2019s urban center, wounded people share beds and after death, they share graves.", "Civilians living in Hodeidah, especially small towns like Durihimi, have faced a devastating siege on a scale even more dire than the rest of the country since last summer when the US-Saudi coalition launched their invasion and assault to occupy Hodeidah port.

The current war has destroyed infrastructure and health care in Yemen.", "Fact 2: Aerial bombardment hospitals in Yemen have been repeatedly destroyed and it is difficult for hospitals to provide electricity and running water permanently in light of airstrikes.

Families are often asked to take the sick and wounded to hospitals without the help of ambulances. All 22 governorates of Yemen are affected by the fighting.", "Fact 3: In less than a year of fighting in Yemen, airstrikes hit 39 hospitals.
