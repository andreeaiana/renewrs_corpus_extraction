The further extension of control by forces in southern Yemen will reinforce the secession movement there. The stakes are particularly high due to the Hadramout\u2019s role in oil production\u2014those who control the country's vital resources will have the most power to impose their political visions and goals.", "The question of oil control has also impacted the recent history of Yemen all the way from the unification of North and South Yemen in 1990. A glance into this past suggests possible pathways and outcomes for what may shape up to be the most recent contest for the Hadramout\u2019s resources.", "The major revenue stream from Yemen\u2019s oil\u2014though primarily from the south\u2014continued to secure loyalty to Saleh while motivating subsequent incursions into the south. In 2015, for example, Al-Qaeda controlled the coast of Hadramout, where the most important oil export outlet is located. Although the legitimate Yemeni government had announced that the production and export of oil has ceased for 18 months, news reports indicated that al-Qaeda continued to market and sell oil in Mukalla.", "According to the report, Al-Qaeda leaders had been in contact with local agents or ships at sea to complete deals. Other data indicated that the value of exports of crude petroleum in 2015 was $715 million and the value of petroleum gas exports was $715 million.", "None of the previous reports and data mentioned who the agents are, but, according to a similar report, Ali Mohsin Al-Ahmar, current Vice-President, managed to push Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi aside and in 21014 negotiated energy contracts directly with China. Ali Mohsin's sons also acted as agents in Marib to sell Yemeni energy products. This leads to the belief that Al-Ahmar might have cooperated in making these deals, especially since Ali Mohsen is known to have a relationship with extremist clerics and militants who were tied to terrorist activity in Yemen.", "However, oil production in Yemen overall has been declining due to the recent crisis. There are still significant reserves: according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).", "Much of recent revenue goes to the pockets of influencers in both legitimate and illegitimate ways. For instance, in 2017, the executive director of Safer, a state-owned oil company, said that the security units responsible for protecting the oil fields in Marib\u2014the region adjacent to Hadramout\u2014were stealing and looting oil. The company's chief executive pointed out the presence of military commanders behind these operations, and that the looted quantities were transferred to areas under the control of the Houthis. According to the same source, these oil tankers had been under the protection of the 107th Brigade, which is responsible for protecting oil in the \"safer\" area and receives salaries from the Yemeni government. And while the Masila basin in Hadramout, which holds 80 percent of Yemen\u2019s oil reserves, is protected by military forces from Hadramout, Al-Ahmar controls the state-owned PetroMasila responsible for operating the Mesila oil fields.", "provinces mirror microstates, including the Al-Mahra and Marib provinces, which refuse to supply revenue to the government. Hadramout has formed its own military forces, as did Shabwa and Aden with the support of the Arab alliance, especially the UAE.", "The presence of local forces in Southern Yemen and the expanding powers of local governors increase the chances of southerners getting their demands, even independence.", "Yet these ambitions are hampered by the region\u2019s weighty economic value. The country's resources\u2013most of them in Hadramout and Shabwa\u2013remain in the hands of the government, military commanders, and powerful loyalists. These groups have strong ties with other parties to the conflict in Yemen\u2013including the Islah party in some cases and al-Qaeda in others.", "As the past few years demonstrate, within the conflict developing between the STC and Hadi\u2019s government oil is likely to play a major role in the calculations of both parties.
