Yet, this was not the first instance of terrorist governance, nor is it likely to be the last. In fact, a growing number of jihadist groups appear to be engaging in various levels and aspects of governance in order to gain and maintain local support, particularly in areas with limited or troubled government presence. Governance has also proven to be a useful source of revenue and material gain for many of these groups, including for al\u2011Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen.", "Starting in Yemen in 2011, AQAP conducted the first successful instances of prolonged al\u2011Qaeda governance in the cities of Jaar and Zinjibar \u2013 cities they held for over a year. Returning in 2015, the re\u2011seized these two cites. Most significantly, they held and administered the port city of Mukalla for over a year. Beyond this, numerous cases of small scale governance were recorded in Yemen up to 2017.", "This report describes the evolution of AQAP governance, outlining how an initially severely repressive approach which engaged hudud punishments was reigned in, in favour of a more \u2018hearts and minds\u2019\u2011based approach. It also highlights unique aspects of this governance that were identified as lending to its success in cases such as Mukalla, such as the use of local actors to implement government administration, as well as effective and timely provision of social welfare and public works. Finally, it examines how and why these governance campaigns came to an end. This report holistically collates and analyses the most successful cases of AQAP governance in Yemen. It also highlights the many additional and often overlooked instances of small-scale governance that were less spectacular in nature.", "This report is comprised of three sections. The first describes what jihadist governance is through a review of both jihadist governance and rebel governance in the literature. The second looks in depth at three key case studies between 2011 and 2016 to see what this governance looked like in practice: Jaar and Zinjibar; Rada; and Mukalla. Finally, it considers the implications of terrorist governance for actors seeking to counter and suppress the influence of these groups. It ultimately determines that the provision of key human security and social goods such as effective justice institutions; security; employment; and above all effective and accountable governance, are crucial to subverting local appeal for these groups.", "Finally, it will highlight lessons drawn from the case of Yemen and consider other jihadist actors who have engaged in governance in other locations and suggests we have to examine this growing trend through a nuanced, full\u2011spectrum and long\u2011term approach.", "From the Introduction.", "Yemen proves to be an important and often overlooked case of such jihadist governance. To different extents and for differing lengths of time, al\u2011Qaeda\u2019s local branch, al\u2011Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has implemented some form of governance in some parts of the country. The group has also notably adapted its actions and approach over the years. This was seen, for example, when it attempted to minimize the enforcement of Islamic punishment (which had brought much criticism), instead working to \u2018correct\u2019 what it viewed as un\u2011Islamic behaviour through more structured judicial means. It also began to provide extensive public services ranging from judicial to security in areas facing gaps in these public goods.

Yet, this was not the first instance of terrorist governance, nor is it likely to be the last. In fact, a growing number of jihadist groups appear to be engaging in various levels and aspects of governance in order to gain and maintain local support, particularly in areas with limited or troubled government presence. Governance has also proven to be a useful source of revenue and material gain for many of these groups, including for al\u2011Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen.", "Starting in Yemen in 2011, AQAP conducted the first successful instances of prolonged al\u2011Qaeda governance in the cities of Jaar and Zinjibar \u2013 cities they held for over a year.

Beyond this, numerous cases of small scale governance were recorded in Yemen up to 2017.", "This report describes the evolution of AQAP governance, outlining how an initially severely repressive approach which engaged hudud punishments was reigned in, in favour of a more \u2018hearts and minds\u2019\u2011based approach.

Finally, it examines how and why these governance campaigns came to an end. This report holistically collates and analyses the most successful cases of AQAP governance in Yemen. It also highlights the many additional and often overlooked instances of small-scale governance that were less spectacular in nature.", "This report is comprised of three sections. The first describes what jihadist governance is through a review of both jihadist governance and rebel governance in the literature. The second looks in depth at three key case studies between 2011 and 2016 to see what this governance looked like in practice: Jaar and Zinjibar; Rada; and Mukalla. Finally, it considers the implications of terrorist governance for actors seeking to counter and suppress the influence of these groups. It ultimately determines that the provision of key human security and social goods such as effective justice institutions; security; employment; and above all effective and accountable governance, are crucial to subverting local appeal for these groups.", "Finally, it will highlight lessons drawn from the case of Yemen and consider other jihadist actors who have engaged in governance in other locations and suggests we have to examine this growing trend through a nuanced, full\u2011spectrum and long\u2011term approach.", "From the Introduction.", "Yemen proves to be an important and often overlooked case of such jihadist governance. To different extents and for differing lengths of time, al\u2011Qaeda\u2019s local branch, al\u2011Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has implemented some form of governance in some parts of the country. The group has also notably adapted its actions and approach over the years. This was seen, for example, when it attempted to minimize the enforcement of Islamic punishment (which had brought much criticism), instead working to \u2018correct\u2019 what it viewed as un\u2011Islamic behaviour through more structured judicial means.

Finally, it considers the implications of terrorist governance for actors seeking to counter and suppress the influence of these groups. It ultimately determines that the provision of key human security and social goods such as effective justice institutions; security; employment; and above all effective and accountable governance, are crucial to subverting local appeal for these groups.", "Finally, it will highlight lessons drawn from the case of Yemen and consider other jihadist actors who have engaged in governance in other locations and suggests we have to examine this growing trend through a nuanced, full\u2011spectrum and long\u2011term approach.", "From the Introduction.", "Yemen proves to be an important and often overlooked case of such jihadist governance.

Yet, this was not the first instance of terrorist governance, nor is it likely to be the last. In fact, a growing number of jihadist groups appear to be engaging in various levels and aspects of governance in order to gain and maintain local support, particularly in areas with limited or troubled government presence. Governance has also proven to be a useful source of revenue and material gain for many of these groups, including for al\u2011Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen.", "Starting in Yemen in 2011, AQAP conducted the first successful instances of prolonged al\u2011Qaeda governance in the cities of Jaar and Zinjibar \u2013 cities they held for over a year.

Finally, it examines how and why these governance campaigns came to an end. This report holistically collates and analyses the most successful cases of AQAP governance in Yemen. It also highlights the many additional and often overlooked instances of small-scale governance that were less spectacular in nature.", "This report is comprised of three sections. The first describes what jihadist governance is through a review of both jihadist governance and rebel governance in the literature. The second looks in depth at three key case studies between 2011 and 2016 to see what this governance looked like in practice: Jaar and Zinjibar; Rada; and Mukalla. Finally, it considers the implications of terrorist governance for actors seeking to counter and suppress the influence of these groups. It ultimately determines that the provision of key human security and social goods such as effective justice institutions; security; employment; and above all effective and accountable governance, are crucial to subverting local appeal for these groups.", "Finally, it will highlight lessons drawn from the case of Yemen and consider other jihadist actors who have engaged in governance in other locations and suggests we have to examine this growing trend through a nuanced, full\u2011spectrum and long\u2011term approach.", "From the Introduction.", "Yemen proves to be an important and often overlooked case of such jihadist governance. To different extents and for differing lengths of time, al\u2011Qaeda\u2019s local branch, al\u2011Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has implemented some form of governance in some parts of the country. The group has also notably adapted its actions and approach over the years.
