It may be even bigger than many of us realize.", "While forces within U.S. political circles, Israel and Saudi Arabia keep trying to shift the blame to Iran, the most likely scenario is that the Houthis in North Yemen were responsible for the attack as a follow up to last month\u2019s hit which showed off the capabilities of their new drones.", "That attack set the stage for the latest one in a classic case of the past being prologue. By showing the world it was capable of throwing drones anywhere in Saudi Arabia rebels in Yemen created plausibility for last weekend\u2019s attack.", "And as I said the other day this attack begs a lot of questions. And the ham-fisted push to blame Iran for it, after President Trump all but ruled out a military response from the U.S. from all corners of the U.S. and Saudi establishment opens up even more.", "If this was a swarm attack from Iraq and Iran, as claimed now (and supported by factless conjecture) then how did all the vaunted U.S. technology fail to account for it?", "U.S. Naval CENTCOM is in Bahrain folks. Are these people blind as well as incompetent?", "No. I don\u2019t think they are. Say what you want about U.S. political leadership and the nigh-treasonous bureaucracy supporting it, I don\u2019t think our military is that fundamentally corrupt, lazy or stupid.", "What are we spending all of the money on, after all?", "By continuing to spin this attack up as Iranian in origin people like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Saudi Arabian government are throwing the Pentagon under the bus.", "The truth is that by trying to re-frame this as an attack by Iraqi Shi\u2019ite militias, the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), in conjunction with the IRGC, we are trying to further separate them from the Iraqi government who still openly support them and deflect against Saudi Arabia\u2019s inherent weakness.", "The PMUs have been our target politically in Iraq for months now so as to restart the chaos in Iraq.", "Think back to the drone incident in June which nearly landed us in a war with Iran. The story morphed and changed with each day. The Iranians had the data, the proof, on their side and they let morons like Pompeo say provably false things before releasing it.", "\u201cDrip Drip Drip\u201d is the strategy, as Andrew Breitbart used to call it.

And so on, and so on.", "That\u2019s what Iran did in June, humiliating Trump at every turn. And I\u2019m sure if they weren\u2019t behind this attack they will do the same thing in the coming days.", "And I also think the U.S knows this as well. And that\u2019s why nothing much more will come of it. It will be used diplomatically to tie Trump\u2019s hands and front a lie to conceal more important truths.", "And this brings me to the stark possibility Pepe Escobar laid out in his recent column. The Houthis may, right now, be in a position to launch an all-out attack from Yemen on Saudi Arabia and destabilize the country.", "An uprising in the east has always been on the table. It\u2019s why the Saudis need $80+ per barrel oil. They have to pay for social programs that keep the population relatively happy.", "From every side now, the Saudi Kingdom is under existential threat. So, I\u2019m not surprised they are trying to push the blame for this incident onto Iran.", "The quick announcement by newly-minted Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman that Aramco\u2019s production will be back to normal quickly was done to reassure potential investors in the upcoming Aramco IPO, a $400 billion affair. It is the lynchpin to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s (MbS) Vision 2030 plan for modernizing the kingdom\u2019s economy.", "That fits with the desire to deflect the source of the attack away from their war in Yemen. Because, as bad as the optics are for the U.S. military, they are far worse for the Saudis if the Houthis are truly the culprits.", "At a minimum the changing of the energy minister was a signal that a shift in Saudi policy is forthcoming. But without suing for peace soon MbS may not have time he thought he did.", "Because there is no appetite for all out war with Iran in the U.S. The Saudis are no longer the \u2018good Arabs\u2019 to most Americans.", "The military doesn\u2019t want to put the soldiers at risk, Wall St. doesn\u2019t want to see a financial collapse that makes Lehman Bros. look like a couple of Amish kids on rumspringa.", "War with Iran will not be conventional. It will come from all sides, all across the Shia Crescent, but especially Yemen. Of this the Iranians have been very clear, regardless of the outcome. They believe their missile technology is superior to U.S. air defense systems", "So, MbS better come to the conclusion quick that a settlement in Yemen is the key to his near-term survival.", "And

Despite the multiplicity of actors involved in the conflict in Yemen, all of the ongoing conflicts remain non-international in their nature as none of them occur between two or more States, but only between States and organized groups and between such groups. The same conclusion has been reflected in the recent report by the U.N.

Why the international recognition should mean anything here? The fact that the Houthis actally ARE the government of Yemen controlling 70 % of Yemen's population points to a real difference to actually non-state actors and movements like the Taliban.

Despite the multiplicity of actors involved in the conflict in Yemen, all of the ongoing conflicts remain non-international in their nature as none of them occur between two or more States, but only between States and organized groups and between such groups.

Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen.", "While there have been some indications that Iran is supporting the Houthis\u2019 military campaign, the provision of training, arms or financial support alone would not suffice for the \u2018internationalization\u2019 the conflict.

Why the international recognition should mean anything here? The fact that the Houthis actally ARE the government of Yemen controlling 70 % of Yemen's population points to a real difference to actually non-state actors and movements like the Taliban. Even, the IS when having created and actually governed its self-created \"Islamic State\" could not be compared to Houthis' Yemen: This \"Islamic State\" by itself never had been internationally recognized, there just were \"Syria\" and \"Iraq\". - Imagine, in WWII the US, Britain, the Soviet Union, France and China would have declared they no more would recognize the German Nazi government - acoording to Sobol's and Stevoli's logic, this would have changed WWII into a \"non-international conflict\".

Despite the multiplicity of actors involved in the conflict in Yemen, all of the ongoing conflicts remain non-international in their nature as none of them occur between two or more States, but only between States and organized groups and between such groups.

Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen.", "While there have been some indications that Iran is supporting the Houthis\u2019 military campaign, the provision of training, arms or financial support alone would not suffice for the \u2018internationalization\u2019 the conflict.

Why the international recognition should mean anything here? The fact that the Houthis actally ARE the government of Yemen controlling 70 % of Yemen's population points to a real difference to actually non-state actors and movements like the Taliban.

Despite the multiplicity of actors involved in the conflict in Yemen, all of the ongoing conflicts remain non-international in their nature as none of them occur between two or more States, but only between States and organized groups and between such groups. The same conclusion has been reflected in the recent report by the U.N. Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen.", "While there have been some indications that Iran is supporting the Houthis\u2019 military campaign, the provision of training, arms or financial support alone would not suffice for the \u2018internationalization\u2019 the conflict.

The idea that the Yemen War would be a \"non-international\" conflict because it should not be \"between two or more States, but only between States and organized groups\" is mereley arbitrary, as it just is based on the fact that the Houthi government is not internationally recognized. But, actually in fact this Houthi government now for several years is ruling the main part of an internationally recognized state, the Republic of Yemen. Why the international recognition should mean anything here? The fact that the Houthis actally ARE the government of Yemen controlling 70 % of Yemen's population points to a real difference to actually non-state actors and movements like the Taliban. Even, the IS when having created and actually governed its self-created \"Islamic State\" could not be compared to Houthis' Yemen: This \"Islamic State\" by itself never had been internationally recognized, there just were \"Syria\" and \"Iraq\". - Imagine, in WWII the US, Britain, the Soviet Union, France and China would have declared they no more would recognize the German Nazi government - acoording to Sobol's and Stevoli's logic, this would have changed WWII into a \"non-international conflict\".
