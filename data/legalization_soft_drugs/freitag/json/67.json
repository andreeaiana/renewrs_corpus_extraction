Many farmers in these areas reported that they could no longer produce yields at pre-war levels due to the extensive damage to infrastructure, the high cost of diesel fuel and other agricultural inputs, a collapse in markets and the destruction of roads and storage facilities.", "According to a field survey carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture in the period between March 2015 and March 2018, Saudi attacks completely destroyed 270 agricultural buildings and facilities, 43 agricultural associations, 9,017 traditional irrigation canals, 54 agricultural markets, and 45 export centers.", "High precision U.S. bombs dropped by Saudi-led coalition warplanes destroyed at least 1,834 irrigation pumps, 109 artesian and surface wells, 1,170 modern irrigation networks, 33 solar irrigation units, 12 diggers, 750 pieces of agricultural equipment, 940,400 farms, 7,531 agricultural reserves, 30 productive nurseries, 182 poultry farms, and 359,944 beehives.", "Yemen\u2019s fishing sector has not been spared either.

Importing pesticides, agricultural fertilizers and fuel has also become difficult due to the frequent seizure of seafaring vessels by the coalition.", "For 77 days, the coalition, led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has continued to hold ships loaded with oil derivatives at sea, preventing them from entering the port of Hodeida. The four ships that were allowed in carried transport fuel, not the fuel needed to power generators on which farmers rely.", "Like in Tahamah, the blockade and attacks on agricultural targets across Yemen have not only destroyed machinery and infrastructure, it has had acute ecological impacts that may take decades to reverse. The accumulation of sediment in flood channels due to damaged gates and automatic barriers has caused trees to begin to reclaim now-dormant stream beds and flood plains, hampering the arrival of much-needed floodwaters to agricultural fields.", "Fertile soil, especially in the border areas in Saada and Hajjah, has become environmentally polluted due to the number of weapons dropped in more than half a million airstrikes. That pollution has not only affected the soil, experts fear it could genetically alter the pomegranates, grapes and coffee that were once staple crops in Yemen.", "Yet the international community has done little to curb the Saudi-led coalitions use of starvation as a tactic of war in Yemen.", "This, in large part, according to many Yemenis and legal scholars alike, is because Saudi Arabia enjoys the near-total diplomatic protection of the United States.

It evaluates the food insecurity situation from two perspectives, the farmer's and the consumers', by understanding the challenges posed to establishing food security. The study also explored the direct and indirect impacts of war on food security and agricultural activities, while evaluating how those activities are in relation with food security and production.

The four ships that were allowed in carried transport fuel, not the fuel needed to power generators on which farmers rely.", "Like in Tahamah, the blockade and attacks on agricultural targets across Yemen have not only destroyed machinery and infrastructure, it has had acute ecological impacts that may take decades to reverse. The accumulation of sediment in flood channels due to damaged gates and automatic barriers has caused trees to begin to reclaim now-dormant stream beds and flood plains, hampering the arrival of much-needed floodwaters to agricultural fields.", "Fertile soil, especially in the border areas in Saada and Hajjah, has become environmentally polluted due to the number of weapons dropped in more than half a million airstrikes.

The article focuses on the practice of offering discounts on major sales of US arms, at a cost of billions of dollars.", "These discounts are the result of the routine practice of providing waivers of fees that are supposed to be imposed on foreign buyers of US arms to reimburse the United States for a share of the cost of developing those weapons in the first place. According to a 2018 report by the Government Accountability Office, waivers were granted in an astonishing 99% of sales between 2012 and 2017 for a total of $16 billion. Many of the exceptions were made for non-democratic governments, including a $3.5 billion discount to the Saudi regime for a Lockheed Martin missile defense system. These waivers are good news for arms clients and weapons companies, and bad news for US taxpayers.", "The waivers are a longstanding practice predating the Trump administration. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) has successfully inserted an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would require advance notice to Congress before discounts are provided. Her perfectly reasonable proposal has generated howls of protest from the Pentagon and the arms lobby, arguing that giving Congress input up front would unnecessarily slow down the foreign military sales process, perhaps costing the US key deals in the process.", "Creating greater transparency over arms sales subsidies is unlikely to put a dent in the United States\u2019 dominant position as the world\u2019s leading arms trading nation.

To cite just one example, these four firms have been involved in roughly 90% of the $125 billion in US arms offers to Saudi Arabia over the past decade. Many of those deals for equipment that Saudi Arabia used in the brutal war in Yemen. There is a real question as to whether these sales to Saudi Arabia should be happening at all \u2013 offering them at a discount just adds insult to injury.", "Arms sales discounts are just one element of a full-court press on the part of the Trump administration to bolster US arms exports.
