An all-out battle for Marib could precipitate an enormous humanitarian disaster, as the province hosts at least 800,000 Yemenis already displaced from homes elsewhere. It could also scotch already dwindling chances of a nationwide de-escalation that in turn could lead to talks to end the war.", "What should be done? Outside powers should urgently convene an international contact group under UN auspices to press for a comprehensive ceasefire and inclusive negotiations to stop the war. The Huthis and Yemeni government should drop maximalist demands, and Saudi Arabia should work with the U.S., UN and others to halt the hostilities.", "I. Overview", "The Huthis (who call themselves Ansar Allah) are moving on Marib, the last stronghold of Yemen\u2019s internationally recognised government in the country\u2019s north. A battle for Marib city and the eponymous governorate could trigger mass civilian displacement, shift the war for the north decisively in the Huthis\u2019 favour and open new rounds of combat along the border with Saudi Arabia and in the south. When battles began in January, Crisis Group called for a coordinated international initiative pushing for nationwide de-escalation and comprehensive UN-led political talks, warning that otherwise the belligerents would throw away an opportunity to end the war through a negotiated settlement. No such initiative has occurred. Now the situation is more urgent, and a new chapter of conflict may be taking shape. Before a political settlement becomes even more difficult, outside powers should form a UN-chaired international contact group based in Riyadh to orchestrate efforts to stop the fighting and bring the parties to talks.", "II.Marib, the Imperilled Province", "Since January, the Huthis have seized strategic government military bases to the north east of Sanaa, the rebel-held capital, and swathes of territory in al-Jawf governorate bordering Saudi Arabia, including the provincial capital, al-Hazm. The fighting broke a four-year-old stalemate along the northern front lines that had been sustained in part by locally negotiated non-aggression pacts between the Huthis and their domestic rivals.", "Huthi fighters are advancing east across multiple fronts toward Marib, a once sleepy city that is now an economic hub and a rare bastion of government control. If they capture oil and gas production facilities to Marib\u2019s east, they will be able to cut off the city\u2019s main economic lifeline and the eastbound highway to Seiyoun in neighbouring Hadramawt. A Huthi victory in Marib governorate would give them access to vital resources after years of war-restricted trade in their areas, while largely ending the war with the government for the north \u2013 at least for now, and barring a coalition-supported counterattack. Huthi officials say their commanders believe that they can capture Marib. Yet doing so may take a bloody battle.", "III.The Stakes for Yemen as a Whole", "A battle for Marib could spill over into other parts of the country. It could expand the Huthis\u2019 border war with Saudi Arabia to the desert regions in northern al-Jawf, in the form of missile and drone strikes on targets inside the kingdom and/or ground combat with rival Yemeni and Saudi forces.", "Today, and especially with renewed fighting along the previously quiet northern front lines, all the above tracks are in jeopardy. As battles rage in the north and cross-border attacks resume, Huthi-Saudi talks have faltered. The Stockholm Agreement, too, is hanging by a thread, as violence intensifies along the Red Sea coast and a long-awaited prisoner swap continues to be delayed by wrangling among the Huthis, the government and Riyadh.", "Yemen\u2019s political map is set to change dramatically. Should the government lose Marib, it will forfeit much of its credibility as a counterpart to the Huthis in peace talks.", "IV. What Needs to Happen", "The fighting needs to stop, something that will require international involvement and direct mediation. There is reason to doubt that the Huthis would accept a pause in fighting if they are convinced that they can strike a death blow to the government, at least absent meaningful incentives. Their own offer of a pause in return for primarily economic benefits indicates that, for them, breaking the financial siege of their areas is paramount. The government has not responded, making clear that it sees the proposal as impinging upon its sovereignty.", "The Huthis have suggested that, if local authorities reject their offer, the only solution will be a nationwide de-escalation agreement, arguing that regionally focused agreements like the one for Hodeida are ultimately unsustainable anyway. As part of such a process, they will want tangible economic benefits \u2013 such as free passage of ships into Hodeida, reopening of Sanaa\u2019s airport and a unified national mechanism for revenue collection and salary payments. This deal would not only lessen the Huthis\u2019 economic woes but also spare them a drawn-out battle for areas long known for antipathy toward the Huthis and, for that matter, Sanaa\u2019s rule.", "Halting a battle for Marib is a priority, yet recent experience has shown the limitations of a piecemeal approach to ending the war. It has also shown that the Huthis and Saudis cannot end the war alone, as both may have hoped they could at the end of 2019.", "A comprehensive approach that seeks to meet the core interests of all sides would need to be backed by several groupings", "The Huthis, although feeling increasingly comfortable in their military position in Yemen, are squeezed and isolated economically. They want a break from the war, economic relief, international recognition, and a significant share of power for their movement and their allied de facto authorities in Sanaa.", "During five years of war, Yemen has become poorer and more divided. A political resolution will require long, hard work and will leave most national and regional stakeholders unsatisfied. But it is better than the alternative: still more years of fighting, political and territorial atomisation, as well as ever deeper human deprivation.

Huthi officials say their commanders believe that they can capture Marib. Yet doing so may take a bloody battle.", "III.The Stakes for Yemen as a Whole", "A battle for Marib could spill over into other parts of the country. It could expand the Huthis\u2019 border war with Saudi Arabia to the desert regions in northern al-Jawf, in the form of missile and drone strikes on targets inside the kingdom and/or ground combat with rival Yemeni and Saudi forces.", "Today, and especially with renewed fighting along the previously quiet northern front lines, all the above tracks are in jeopardy. As battles rage in the north and cross-border attacks resume, Huthi-Saudi talks have faltered. The Stockholm Agreement, too, is hanging by a thread, as violence intensifies along the Red Sea coast and a long-awaited prisoner swap continues to be delayed by wrangling among the Huthis, the government and Riyadh.", "Yemen\u2019s political map is set to change dramatically. Should the government lose Marib, it will forfeit much of its credibility as a counterpart to the Huthis in peace talks.", "IV. What Needs to Happen", "The fighting needs to stop, something that will require international involvement and direct mediation. There is reason to doubt that the Huthis would accept a pause in fighting if they are convinced that they can strike a death blow to the government, at least absent meaningful incentives. Their own offer of a pause in return for primarily economic benefits indicates that, for them, breaking the financial siege of their areas is paramount. The government has not responded, making clear that it sees the proposal as impinging upon its sovereignty.", "The Huthis have suggested that, if local authorities reject their offer, the only solution will be a nationwide de-escalation agreement, arguing that regionally focused agreements like the one for Hodeida are ultimately unsustainable anyway. As part of such a process, they will want tangible economic benefits \u2013 such as free passage of ships into Hodeida, reopening of Sanaa\u2019s airport and a unified national mechanism for revenue collection and salary payments. This deal would not only lessen the Huthis\u2019 economic woes but also spare them a drawn-out battle for areas long known for antipathy toward the Huthis and, for that matter, Sanaa\u2019s rule.", "Halting a battle for Marib is a priority, yet recent experience has shown the limitations of a piecemeal approach to ending the war. It has also shown that the Huthis and Saudis cannot end the war alone, as both may have hoped they could at the end of 2019.", "A comprehensive approach that seeks to meet the core interests of all sides would need to be backed by several groupings", "The Huthis, although feeling increasingly comfortable in their military position in Yemen, are squeezed and isolated economically. They want a break from the war, economic relief, international recognition, and a significant share of power for their movement and their allied de facto authorities in Sanaa.", "During five years of war, Yemen has become poorer and more divided. A political resolution will require long, hard work and will leave most national and regional stakeholders unsatisfied. But it is better than the alternative: still more years of fighting, political and territorial atomisation, as well as ever deeper human deprivation. The opportunity to stop the fighting that opened at the end of 2019 is fading fast. It should not be allowed to disappear.", "https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/b74-preventing-deadly-showdown-northern-yemen", "= https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/preventing-deadly-showdown-northern-yemen", "= https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1258601/download", "My comment: In these ideas, the US is given a very important role.

Such land mines were planted everywhere in the district and are heavily concentrated in the eastern borders which are adjacent to Mawza\u2019a district. Landmines in this area remain the overwhelming nightmare which claims human and animal lives. Most of the people of this district bear witness that these mines were planted by Houthis following their withdrawal from the district in January, 2017. \u201cWe, now, have either of two options of death; either to die of hunger or seek our livelihood to be claimed by anti-personnel mines\u201d Said an old man from Dhubab district.", "The people at Dhubab work in four major professions and no more: fishermen (the majority), cattle shepherds, farmers and lumberjacks. However, it is in this district where fishermen fall victims to anti-personnel mines which are like beasts awaiting them at every inch of the area which is 1557 square kilometer.", "\u201cWe no longer bear further displacement and suffering; we have been forced to go back to our houses even though we know for sure that our land is entirely unsafe.\u201d Said Ali (one of the people from Dhubab district).", "I would not exaggerate to say that Dhubab district has entirely become a deadly ground of death and famine. Every morning, the people at Dhubab stare at one another as though they are bidding each other the final farewell. This is because those who leave may not comeback alive, and those who return home, they often get back with a permanent disability due to landmines.", "Many landmines and explosive devices get exposed by time due to flooding and winds. The people can see the landmines but no one can help removing them from their roads. I once visited Bahsa village along with my guide from the village. \u201cLook at this anti-personnel mine on the right; it has been exposed by flooding but no one can remove it; we just sieged it with some bushes and thorns so that vehicles should not run over it, we have no alternative but to use these roads to survive even though we take risks \u2026. we are forced to survive!\u201d My guide explained.", "Nonetheless, all these incidents had not been wiped out from my memory than I received such an unfortunate call in which I was told that Haj Saleh and his wife stepped on an anti-personnel mine. Haj Saleh (60 years) and his wife Salma (40 years), would often leave their house searching for area of pasture for days and sometimes for a month in deserted areas in which can only hear bleating of sheep. In the morning of December 12, they took their sheep as usual for grazing at an area named Khabt Hunaish. While they were talking, Salma saw an anti-personnel mine which was exposed by flooding and she was about to step on it. She informed her husband to beware of that mine. They walked away from the mine and continued their way, yet another landmine was awaiting their fate. Unfortunately, Salma stepped on the mine and it exploded. The mine shrapnel penetrated Salma\u2019s chest and she fell dead. Haj Saleh fractured his right leg. Looking at his wife at such a motionless state, he pulled himself on his back till he reached her to find that she passed away.", "In Dhubab, people lose their relatives, belongings, vehicles, cattle and everything related to their life.

It is also one of his most spectacular failures. All American presidents have catered to Saudi Arabia to one degree or another, but Trump has distinguished himself as the most subservient and indulgent of them all. He has given the Saudi government and the crown prince all the support and diplomatic cover that they could ask for, and in exchange he has received absolutely nothing. Trump has enabled the war criminals in Riyadh for the last three years, and he doesn\u2019t have anything to show for it except for lasting ignominy. The Saudi coalition massacred innocent Yemenis for years with U.S.-made weapons, and Trump resisted Congress\u2019 efforts to shut down U.S. support for the war. He went out of his way to go around Congress to continue selling Saudi Arabia and the UAE weapons over Congressional objections. Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, and Trump and Pompeo ran interference for him once the murder came to light. The inept and useless Saudi government couldn\u2019t even defend its own territory, so Trump put U.S. troops in harm\u2019s way to shield them from further attacks.

Only a significant change in territorial control, coupled with a shift in local alliances, can lay the groundwork for serious negotiations.", "Second, an overemphasis on ending the war at all costs could lead to concluding a fragile agreement that only results in another cycle of violence. The ambiguous Stockholm Agreement and the subsequent desperate attempts to show progress in Hodeida, however tenuous, and save the deal from collapsing reflect a flawed approach. Griffiths has recently sought to revive the peace process regardless of the status of the Stockholm Agreement", "The UN must prevent the fall of Marib", "In an effort to normalize the status quo in Hodeida, the UN emphasized the potential humanitarian costs to conclude the Stockholm Agreement, an approach that should be used in Marib to protect more than a million internally displaced persons (IDPs). While the UN has acknowledged Marib\u2019s large IDP population, it has yet to explain how the international community will protect them. Marib has the largest population of IDPs in the country; in addition to the 770,028 displaced persons recorded in March 2019, there are thousands of newly displaced families and unregistered IDPs. During his one-day visit to Marib, Griffiths understood the stakes at hand, visiting al-Jafina IDP camp, the largest such camp, which hosts more than 6,000 displaced families.", "Most importantly, Griffiths\u2019 call for de-escalation shouldn\u2019t in any way, shape, or form allow the Houthis to seize the moment once again to expand their territorial control. The local balance of power around Marib is enough of a cause for concern already, with the Houthis now surrounding the city from the north via al-Hazm (134 km away) and the east via Sirwah (about 40 km away). There is a high likelihood that they will launch a multi-sided attack on Marib in an effort to capture the oil fields of Safer, nearly 70 km east of the city.

An attack on Marib would result in massive displacement, compounding the already serious humanitarian crisis.
