The number of people provided with food and livelihood assistance each month increased from 5.9 million to 7.5 million, a 27 per cent increase.

Similarly, Emergency Employment and Community Rehabilitation (EECR) Cluster partners reached a total of 331,912 people, with emergency employment opportunities in 102 districts in 19 governorates.

The nutrition operation expanded considerably in 2018 and a higher percentage of ill and malnourished children are surviving in Yemen than at any time since the conflict started. The number of children treated for SAM increased by 31 per cent, up from 263,313 in 2017 to 345,661 in 2018.

Differences between the Quds 1 and the Soumar include the entire booster design, the wing position, the Quds 1\u2019s fixed wings, the shape of the nose cone, the shape of the aft fuselage, the position of the stabilizers and the shape of the engine cover and exhaust. \u2026", "There is yet another apparent difference between the Quds 1 and the Soumar/Hoveyzeh: size.", "Also, the Quds 1 features a Czech-made TJ100 engine, which is less powerful than the Russian-made engine on the Kh-55.", "\u201cAll of this leaves the question of just who developed and built the Quds 1,\u201d Hinz wrote. \u201cThe idea that impoverished war-torn Yemen would be able to develop a cruise missile without any outside assistance seems far-fetched. Iran\u2019s previous supply of missiles to the Houthis and the fact that the country uses TJ100 engines in its drone program do imply that Iran could be behind the Quds 1.\u201d", "\u201cHowever, so far we haven\u2019t seen any trace of the Quds 1 in Iran proper.

This proved increasingly difficult as the U.S. treated any nation or company that used the U.S. banking system to facilitate a transaction with Iran in violation of its terms. As a result, in May 2019, Iran began suspending its commitments under the JCPOA, something it (rightfully) claimed was permitted under the terms of the JCPOA in the case of noncompliance by a party to the agreement. (Iran claimed, with justification, that the EU was in noncompliance by failing to permit the unrestricted sale of Iranian oil to EU customers.) The U.S. responded by dispatching two B-52 bombers and an aircraft carrier battlegroup to the region, an action Bolton claimed was intended to \u201csend a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.\u201d By all appearances, it looked as if the U.S. campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d was about to enter its final phase.", "This is where the narrative gets interesting.
